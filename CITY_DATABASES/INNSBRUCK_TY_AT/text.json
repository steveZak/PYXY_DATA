        "wiki": "Ambras Castle (German: Schloss Ambras Innsbruck) is a Renaissance castle and palace located in the hills above Innsbruck, Austria. Ambras Castle is 587 metres (1,926 ft) above sea level. Considered one of the most popular tourist attractions of the Tyrol, Ambras Castle was built in the 16th century on the spot of an earlier 10th-century castle, which became the seat of power for the Counts of Andechs. The cultural and historical importance of the castle is closely connected with Archduke Ferdinand II (1529\u20131595) and served as his family residence from 1567 to 1595. Ferdinand was one of history's most prominent collectors of art. The princely sovereign of Tyrol, son of Emperor Ferdinand I, ordered that the medieval fortress at Ambras be turned into a Renaissance castle as a gift for his wife Philippine Welser.  The cultured humanist from the House of Habsburg accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum: The collections, still in the Lower Castle built specifically for that museum purpose, make Castle Ambras Innsbruck the oldest museum in the world.\nThe Lower Castle contains armouries that feature masterpieces of the European armourer's art from the time of Emperor Maximilian I to Emperor Leopold I. As the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the \"Kunst- und Wunderkammer\" (Chamber of Art and Wonders) represents an unrivalled cultural monument.\nAbove the Lower Castle is the famous Spanish Hall (Spanischer Saal), a notable example of German Renaissance architecture, which contains an intricate wood-inlay ceiling and walls adorned with 27 full-length portraits of the rulers of Tyrol. The Upper Castle contains the extensive Habsburg Portrait gallery (Habsburger Portr\u00e4tgalerie) featuring paintings of numerous members of the House of Austria and other leading ruling Europeaen dynasties, including, as a remarkable feature, many portraits of princely children.\n\n\n== History ==\nLong before Innsbruck became a city, references to an Amras or Omras appeared in documents dating from the 10th century. This early fortification in what was then the southwest corner of Bavaria was the seat of power of the Counts of Andechs, who became Margraves of Istria and later Dukes of the short-lived Imperial State of Merania from 1180 to 1248. This original fortification was destroyed in 1133 and no traces of it remain, although some of the material from the original structure was later used in the modern building. In 1248, the castle ruins and property passed by inheritance from the Counts of Andechs to Count Albert IV of Tyrol.\n\nThe modern Ambras Castle was built by Archduke Ferdinand II (1529\u20131595), the second son of Emperor Ferdinand I. When he was made provincial sovereign of Tyrol in 1564, Ferdinand II ordered two Italian architects to turn the existing medieval fortress into a Renaissance castle for his untitled wife Philippine Welser (1527\u20131580), whom he had married in secret. Ferdinand II prepared his family's residence in the Upper Castle, beneath which he constructed one of the most artistically important halls of the late Renaissance\u2014known as the \"Spanish Hall\" since the nineteenth century. In 1567, Ferdinand II  made his entry into Innsbruck, prior to that, he was appointed administrating governor to the Kingdom of Bohemia, taking up residence in Prague in 1547. In 1589, he added an additional building, the Heldenr\u00fcstkammer, west of the Lower Castle for the purpose of housing his collection of \"Heroes\", the very first systematic presentation of objects in the history of museums. Ambras Castle was used as the residence of Philippine as well as a place for Ferdinand II to house his collection of weapons, suits of armour, portraits, natural objects, as well as rarities and precious objects. Today, the art history museum Schloss Ambras Innsbruck is part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna.\nPhilippine became a popular and beloved figure through her charity and willingness to help others, particularly the common people of Tyrol. Even the nobility brought their petitions to the former commoner. As signs of affection, people addressed their written petitions to \"Merciful Miss\" or \"serene Princess Mrs. Philippine of Austria\". After Ferdinand's death in 1595, the second son of Ferdinand and Philippine, Margrave Charles of Burgau, inherited Ambras Castle. With little interest in preserving the castle or its collections, they fell into a state of dilapidation and Charles sold them in 1606 to Emperor Rudolf II. The emperor residing in Prague left his uncle's collection nearly in its entirety at Ambras Castle, as he himself was one of the most important Habsburg collectors.\n\nIn the following years, Ambras Castle no longer had the status of an official residence and was seldom lived in. Inadequate preservation measures led to the loss of valuable books, manuscripts, and hand sketches, and soon the palace fell largely into disrepair. In the seventeenth century, Emperor Leopold I (1640\u20131705) had some of the most valuable holdings of the Ambras collections\u2014mostly books and manuscripts\u2014moved to Vienna, where they can still be seen at the Austrian National Library. In 1805, the remaining Ambras collections were threatened by the defeat of Austria by the French Empire. Fortunately, after he recognized the private-law character of the Ambras collection, Napoleon (1769\u20131821) had it brought to safety in Vienna.In 1855, Archduke Karl Ludwig, then governor of Tyrol, had the palace remodeled to use as a summer residence. Significant changes were made during this time to the palace and the surrounding park. The Outer Bailey (Vorschloss) was constructed with an ivy-clad entrance ramp for carriages. The park was redesigned as an English garden. Following Archduke Karl Ludwig's renouncement of his succession rights in 1889, the palace fell once again into ruinous condition. In 1880, it was converted into a museum and subsequently renovated.In 1919, following the dissolution of the Austria-Hungary Empire, Ambras Castle became the property of the Republic of Austria. In 1950, the Kunsthistorisches Museum took over the administration of the castle and its collections. Throughout the 1970s, a comprehensive restoration took place of the Spanish Hall, the Upper Castle residential quarters, and the inner courtyard. In 1974, the Chamber of Art and Wonders was completed. In 1976, the Habsburg Portrait Gallery covering the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries was completed. In 1981, the Armouries was reopened in the Lower Castle.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nSchloss Ambras Innsbruck is a federal museum of the Republic of Austria. It is administratively part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna and belongs to the KHM-Museumsverband.\nFerdinand II was one of the most important patrons of the Habsburg family. He founded the notable collections of Ambras and had a museum built for them in the rooms of the \"Lower Castle\", which was constructed according to the most advanced ideas of his time. The three Armouries and the Chamber of Art and Wonders were designed and used as a museum from the beginning.\n\n\n=== Spanish Hall ===\nThe Spanish Hall, built between 1569 and 1572, is one of the most important freestanding halls of the Renaissance. The picturesque lay-out of the 43-metre (141 ft) long hall is dominated by the 27 full-length portraits of the princely rulers of the Tyrol. Today rather famous classical concerts take place in this hall.\n\n\n=== Chamber of Art and Wonders ===\n\nThe Chamber of Art and Wonders of Archduke Ferdinand II is the only Renaissance Kunstkammer which can still be seen in its original place. Others had been plundered like the ones in Munich, Prague or Stuttgart, or their character had been changed like in Dresden or Kassel.\nIn the Chamber of Art and Wonders at Ambras Castle artificialia, naturalia, scientifica, exotica, and mirabilia are to be seen: natural wonders (rare, unique and excellent things of nature) as well as precious objects, scientific items, toys, or luxury items of the time, and so on.  In contents the natural and artistic objects represent the programme of the late Renaissance encyclopedic collections. The special thing about the Ambras-collections is, that they are still where they were meant to be seen. Still you can find corals arranged in cabinet-boxes, turnery made of wood or ivory, glass figures, or porcelain and silk paintings which belong to the oldest European collections of Asian, African and American art (exotica).\nAlso important works of European artists, like the carved \"little death\" made of wood by Hans Leinberger can be found, as well as typical Kunstkammer - objects like handstones, goblets made of rhinoceros horn, coconut or rock crystal, animals made of bronze, music- and measuring instruments, automats and clocks. A very important part of the collection were portraits of wondrous persons like the hairy people, Vlad Dracula  and others.\n\n\n=== Armouries ===\n\nArchduke Ferdinand II's idea of a museum was a novelty: he systematically collected armour from famous personalities of his time. He presented this armour \"to the eternal memory\" of that persons - mostly military commanders - in the \"Heldenr\u00fcstkammer\" (Heroes' Armoury); some on display today still in the original 16th century showcases.  His \"R\u00fcstkammern\" (Armouries) contain very rare examples of arms and armour from the 15th century which originally came from the collections of Emperor Maximilian I and Archduke Sigismund. Armour for tournaments like the German joust or the German course, and the armour of the court's giant Bartlm\u00e4 Bon, who took part in the tournament in Vienna in 1560, can be seen. The \"Leibr\u00fcstkammer\" (Court Armoury) includes the archduke's private armour and the armour of the court of Innsbruck. Ferdinand's collection of armour was one of the most important of its kind, not only because of the collection idea, but also because of the quality and quantity of his objects. Today, selected objects still illustrate the museum idea  in Innsbruck at Ambras Castle, whereas many of the armour is exhibited at the Hofjagd- und R\u00fcstkammer (Imperial Armoury) of the Kusthistorisches Museum, Vienna.\n\n\n=== Upper Castle ===\nThe Upper Castle, the oldest part of Ambras Castle, contains the Habsburg Portrait Gallery. About 300 portraits from the 15th to the 19th century, including King Albrecht II, Emperor Maximilian I, Charles V and Ferdinand I, to the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Franz II, a contemporary of Napoleon Bonaparte. Because of the various dynastic relations, the collection also shows members of other European dynasties. The portraits were painted by well-known artists such as Lucas Cranach the Elder, Antonis Mor, Titian, Anthony van Dyck and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.\nThe Strasser Collection of Glass is amongst the most important of its kind in the world. Built up by Professor Rudolf Strasser over a period of more than fifty years this collection includes valuable Renaissance and Baroque Period lasses from Europe's most important glass producing regions, for example Venice, Bohemia, Hall, Innsbruck and Silesia. The high quality of the collection is quite comparable with the collection of these epochs in the Corning Museum of Glass.The Collection of Gothic Sculpture presents objects date from the time of Emperor Maximilian I (1459\u20131519). The main work is the imposing St George altar-piece which was made by Sebold Bocksdorfer commissioned by Maximilian and important for the Habsburg's Order of Saint George.\nThe Inner Courtyard, decorated between 1564 and 1567 with grisaille painting al fresco (grey painting on still-wet plaster), is among the best-preserved examples of fresco from the sixteenth century. The representations of princely virtues and muses, female and male heroes, and diverse heroic acts sought to display the royalty as exemplary. They relate to their commissioner Archduke Ferdinand II, patron of the arts and host of lavish festivities.\nIn cultural historical terms the Bathing Chambers of Philippine Welser, the only bath of the 16th century completely preserved, is something of a cultural heritage.\nThe Chapel is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Consecrated for the first time in 1330 and often rebuilt over the centuries, it was finally painted in the 19th century by the Innsbruck painter August W\u00f6rndle.\n\n\n== Ambras Castle silver coin ==\nAmbras Castle is so popular and well known, that it was the subject of one of the best known famous silver collectors' coins: the 10 euro Ambras Castle coin.\nOn the obverse of the coin there is a general view of the castle to the south of Innsbruck with its Renaissance style gardens forms the central design. On the reverse, three court musicians cross the floor of the Spanish Hall, based on a picture from 1569. This design recalls the court festivals for which Fedinand II had the Spanish Hall specially constructed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmbraser Heldenbuch\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmbras Castle official website\nAmbras Castle 360\u00b0 fullscreen panoramas\nEntry about Ambras  at Burgen-Austria (Castles Austria)",

          "Lovely photographic castle, interesting artifacts. Lots and lots of family portraits which get a bit boring after a while, though we did chuckle at the family trait of a fat bottom lip! Beautiful gardens.",
          "Visited during free time from a RIVIERA TRAVEL escorted tour. Castle lies fifty yards downhill from the hop-on-hop-on bus (Ambras stop). It's a wedding venue, an armoury museum but above all, it's a collection of Hapsburg and von Thurn and Taxis portraits plus family trees.",
          "In addition to the massive collection of armour and armament there is this collection of curiosities which is very hard to summarise. Mind boggling variety of interesting things. It would take a day to do this collection and you would continue to be amazed, Another surprising",

        "wiki": "The Goldenes Dachl (Golden Roof) is a landmark structure located in the Old Town (Altstadt) section of Innsbruck, Austria. It is considered the city's most famous symbol. Completed in 1500, the roof was decorated with 2,657  fire-gilded copper tiles for Emperor Maximilian I to mark his wedding to Bianca Maria Sforza. The Emperor and his wife used the balcony to observe festivals, tournaments, and other events that took place in the square below.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe entire oriel is decorated in sculpted reliefs and mural paintings. The first-floor balustrade is adorned with eight sculpted coats of arms, six facing the square and two flanking panels, representing Maximilian's territories. Above the coats of arms are frescoes by J\u00f6rg K\u00f6lderer, painted in 1500, showing two knights bearing heraldic flags representing the Holy Roman Empire and Tyrol.The second-floor balustrade is decorated in eight sculpted reliefs, six facing the square and two flanking panels, depicting various images associated with Maximilian's life. The two central reliefs show Maximilian. The one on the left shows the Emperor with his second wife Bianca Maria Sforza on the left holding an apple, and his beloved first wife Maria of Burgundy on the right. The other central relief shows the Emperor with his court jester and his chancellor. The flanking reliefs show Moorish dancers engaged in \"acrobatic and grotesque dancing\"\u2014a common form of popular entertainment of that time. The dancing shown in these outer reliefs is of Andalusian origin.The frescoes that adorn the interior of the loggia were also painted by J\u00f6rg K\u00f6lderer and show scenes from the aristocratic life of that time. All of the decorations on the current structure are carefully executed replicas. The original reliefs are on permanent display in the Tyrolean State Museum, known as the Ferdinandeum.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building that bears the Goldenes Dachl was constructed by Archduke Friedrich IV in the early fifteenth century as the residence of the Tyrolean sovereigns. Emperor Maximilian I commissioned the loggia in 1493 from Nikolaus Turing the Elder, the Innsbruck court builder, at the time of his marriage to Bianca Maria Sforza. It was Turing who designed and built the \"golden\" roof with its 2,657 fire-gilded copper tiles.The Goldenes Dachl was designed to serve as a royal box where the Emperor and his imperial entourage could sit in state and enjoy festivals, tournaments, and other events that took place in the square below. The Goldenes Dachl was built in honor of Maximilian's marriage to Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan. Not wishing to alienate the allies gained by his first marriage, to Maria of Burgundy, he had an image of himself between the two women painted on his balcony.\nSince January 2003, the Goldenes Dachl has housed the International Alpine Convention's Office. The Alpine Convention is a coalition of eight Alpine Countries united by a shared commitment to sustainable development in the European Alps. A museum, the Maximilianum, is also contained in the building as well as the Innsbruck City Archives.\nIn March 2017, Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif were on Goldenes Dachl as a part of the shooting of a romantic song \u201cDil Diyan Gallan\u201d which has more than 540 million YouTube views for the action packed spy romance Indian movie Tiger Zinda Hai produced by Yash Raj Films. \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoldenes Dachl Museum (German)\nEntry about Goldenes Dachl  at Burgen-Austria (Castles Austria)",

          "It's a nice golden roof, but honestly I don't understand why everybody is crazy about it. Innsbruck has much more to offer.",
          "The golden roof and surrounding buildings are in a nice area. Worth looking at but the golden roof itself is not that large.",
          "It's a beautiful piece of history, in a beautiful town to stroll around. The story behind the Golden Roof is lovely, and the atmosphere in the streets in the immediate vicinity was just amazing in December. Definitely at least see it if you're in Innsbruck - you don't need to",
          "We saw this as one of the points to visit and we did. Unsure of the history but it definitely looks interesting and within a great old world vibe.",
          "You'll probably miss it at first glance. Nothing much to talk about. However, the rest of the city is beautiful, amazing views...",
          "You really can\u2019t miss this if visiting the old town. It dominates the end of the Main Street. Take some pictures but won\u2019t take you long!",
          "... or better said, a tourist trap. Yes, if you're in Innsbruck, do go and pass by. Just don't expect a lot of locals. Expect tourist traps, one after another. Small boutiques, all selling the same. Just overly priced restaurants. And little tirolean things....... It's nice to",
          "This is in a very busy tourist area. The museum is good for a quick visit and included in the Innsbruck card. It\u2019s worth a stop inside beyond pictures.",
          "Situated right in the middle of the city center. It is the hub of activity. All around you will find history, restaurants and people jist enjoying themselves.",
          "The roof as promised is of gold. Build by the emperor, and the balcony was used by him to view over the city. It's a nice square with some nice places to eat and a relaxed atmosphere. By night it's even quieter, but you won't get the great shine.",
          "During a stroll through the old town, nobody will miss the Golden Roof. It's lovely to look at and watch all the tourist from all over the world to make pictures and nobody takes care about the history",
          "The Golden Roof is very memorable ,its here in 201,7 Salman Khan & Katrina shot for the movie Tiger Zinda Hai. Its here ,we brought a couple of sketches of the Golden Roof from a wayside artist,who kindly drew a sketch of my wife & which got framed & part of our memory. A",
          "This building is nice with some beautiful paintings and the golden roof but ir is not that much. A good spot for some photos but nothing else than that.",
          "The golden roof is definitely something to see. We did not go inside. There are a lot of shops and restaurants around.",
          "This is the picture postcard of INNSBRUK and so a photo op here is a must. There is a little history to it and then u can enjoy the amazing food and shops in the vicinity.",
          "We viewed the Golden Roof from the square and took a few pictures. It has a nice story to it but otherwise was not special to see on the merits of asthetics. The area is very popular with wonderful cafes and shops, so head to this landmark and enjoy the whole area!",
          "This roof is on the balcony which was extra addition to the building by some king so that the royal family can watch performances in the square below. Now the golden tiles are missing( stolen) and only golden painting is there.",
          "A must to see - but why? The building is full if statues and paintings. Interesting. To me the golden roof looks more like a micture of metals.",
          "Even though there is no gold now( the roof is now just painted in golden colour) The balcony and the roof are clearly visible as extensions of the old palace building. The balcony gives a very good view of the square.",
          "The world famous Innsbruck golden roof. Spend only a little time seeing it and roam the square and passage instead to see some interesting things.",
          "Nice shopping area with nice restaurants. Has that alpine feel to it that makes you want to chug hot chocolate and look the closest ski lift.",
          "Unfortunately, they had a stage set up right in front of it, covering most of it while we were here, but don't want to leave a poor review for that reason. Located in a fun area of town with plenty to do, and very close to the main shopping areas",
          "A flamboyant piece of architecture within an already impressive old town, the Golden Roof shows the wealth of the old dukes of Tyrol and their pride in Innsbruck.",
          "It is hard to comment on a few golden tiles. Well... Talking about tiles, I was told they are really copper tiles. But how did copper tiles ended with a golden look? Perhaps could it be brass. Anyway, the location is really at the crossroad of the old town, it will be",
          "We assumed that the roof would be much bigger, however it is quiet small. Not sure what the fuss is all about.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful historic landmark of the city, a late Gothic window commissioned in 1459. Just viewed from the front while our tour guide explained its history.",
          "On our tour, there was quite a detailed story as we stood in front of the Golden Roof. Our tour guide was very knowledgable. We admired, took some photos and that's about it. It is important to the town of Innsbruck. Pictures are very nice.",
          "Great to see a city preserving its history. This late Gothic window was commissioned by Emporer Maximillian I (1459 - 1519) to commemorate his wedding to Bianca Maria Sforza of Spain.",
          "I though it was more to see. Never see this here before but also think it is not so special. Use 10 min. and that was all",
          "Fascinating history of the building when you visit the museum. How the tiles were made. There are many other buildings worth a visit in Innsbruck",
          "It\u2019s there! A roof. A very pretty golden roof. Nice for a photo. In the old town. Maybe enjoy a drink at one of the cafes around it. Easter and Christmas markets held there too.",
          "Old town Innsbruck was one of our favorite places in our Germany-Austria tour. The golden roof and old town Innsbruck along with the towering Alps makes this city one of our favorites. The golden roof stands out in the main plaza and is surrounded by amazing architecture.",
          "The Golden Roof was apparently completed at the end of the fifteenth century and was decorated with 2.657 fire-gilded tiles. It was built under the aegis of Emperor Maximilian I by Nikolas Turing the Elder though the construction of the building which contains nowadays that roof",
          "Well preserved beautiful historical place of Old Town Innsbruck. Easy to find. Must to visit and take pictures.",
          "It is not something that I would fly to see but it is a nice piece of history. Well preserved and easy to get to. I gave the place a 5 start because there is no reason why I should give it less.",
          "This restaurant is situation at the intersection of two well traveled streets in Old Town Innsbruck. It is comfortable and an enjoyable place to eat. Since it is winter, there were not a lot of people there.",
          "You don't need to set aside much time for this. We went through museum in about half hour. The square outside is great opportunity to take photos of beautiful and very old buildings.",
          "Its interesting and the old city is very pretty. However the golden roof is only small so if your looking for something huge then be prepared. But everything around is really pretty so do not miss the old part of innsbruck",
          "This roof is truly unique and beautiful and set in a prime spot in the old town. It\u2019s very historical. It is however - a gold roof. It will take you a few minutes to have a look and get some photos (if you can catch it in the afternoon sunshine it looks best) but that\u2019s all the",
          "In the old town, not massively impressive to look at to be honest although obviously it\u2019s history plays a part.",
          "It is there, as you walk the mall you see it. A different sort of attraction which is located in a place everyone goes by",
          "At the end of the town square stands this beautiful facade. It\u2019s called to have a golden ceiling but at least outdoors I did not see it. Perhaps it requires you to go indoors? In that case, worth a second visit.",
          "The golden roof in Innsbruck is a must see. Such wonderful architecture in the center of the old town.",
          "It\u2019s alright, nothing bad to say nothing good either just a roof that\u2019s gold, if you want to find a good roof see the opera house or something, even the cathedral in Vienna. Very overrated roof.",
          "Maybe because I don't know the history behind the golden roof I did not find it appealing. For me it was just a small window with a roof cover in a golden lining. To the left there is a more attractive and beautiful building.",
          "Very pretty, great view if you climb the bell tower just facing it. Has infomation plaque all around Innsbruck about the history of places in both German and English which is great for non German speaking people",
          "I came to Innsbruck during Christmas so I got to experience the Christmas market and the crowds. It was fun and different. During the evening when I was there (a few days before Christmas) we were serenaded by a brass quartet from the Golden Roof. I\u2019m not sure if you can go",
          "We visited The Golden Roof to experience the Christmas markets. The Golden Roof itself is interesting and one of the main visitor attractions in Innsbruck. In the run up to Christmas the square below is transformed with a huge Christmas tree and a large market with lots of",
          "The Golden Roof is just next to the Helbling Haus and is made of copper that in a sunny day relfetcs the sunlight to give a glowing appearance. It used to be the viewing platform for the Emperror to view parades etc.",
          "A Landmark that can be seen and enjoyed from a few blocks away... All apart of the history of Innsbruck and the golden roof glistens in the sun....",
          "This is the most famous icon of Innsbruck, located right in the center of the Altstadt. There is sometimes a brass band playing music from the balcony. The area surrounding it is quite nice with several stands and restaurants around.",
          "Kind of cool to see all the expense right out there in the open but it didn't mean all that much in the entirely terrific area. With all the great shops and signage, I actually enjoyed much more walking around the area than just seeing the golden marriage waving area.",
          "Very crowded due to the Christmas Market but well worth a view. Brass band were playing on the balcony which was very nice. Beautiful building in a beautiful setting, lots of lovely restaurants all around.",
          "It was wonderful returning to see the symbol of Innsbruck - Golden Roof, after so many years. The experience was made even more enjoyable by having a warm and delish Currywurst from a hotdog stand, right underneath this famous landmark The atmosphere was also very festive, with",
          "Beautiful building looks great when it is floodlight at night beautiful colours the square at night is charming in the xmas season",
          "We walked to this it's very crowded and just a roof made out of gold only stayed here a few minutes. Worth a look if passing",
          "I mean, sure, it's kinda cool... we saw a brass band playing from the balcony over the square below but it's not a highlight of my trip to Innsbruck...",
          "We heard a lot about the golden roof. We were able to photograph it with the sun setting on the mountains behind it and a Christmas tree in front. Great memory...",
          "How do you maximize the day or so that you are spending in a small, remote, or otherwise Not-too-WOO-WOO of a city? You rent bikes!! YES! Get on your bum and get those knees pumping! We had, I think, about a day in Innsbruck. We were travelling thru from Austria via train to",
          "We wanted to do a day trip into Austria and drove into Innsbruck. Really nice small town with the Golden Roof right in the middle of town.",
          "I was both pleased and disappointed with my trip to Innsbruck. On the one hand, the view from the city centre of the surrounding mountains is breathtaking; however, there\u2019s just not hat much going on in the place. This roof is the highlight of the city centre and, let\u2019s be",
          "This is a \u2013 perhaps the \u2013 landmark structure in Innsbruck, located in the heart of the old town. Completed in the 16th century, the roof was decorated with nearly 2,700 \u201cfire-gilded\u201d copper tiles, which give the roof its distinctive golden appearance. Beneath the eponymous roof",
          "We went passing it is stunning. We pose for photos I enjoyed to be around the place. We grab a meal.",
          "The historical attraction was surrounding by bar and shop. So the golden roof was not spectacular. The architecture is beautiful and may spectacular in the time of emperor.",
          "pretty building with some interesting history. you need to come at the right time of the day to see the roof shining and its brightest. its a typical tourist spot so be prepared for lots of photos and everyone waiting for a good shot! a 5 mins activity, however there are some",
          "Beautiful, Main sight in the center of the Innsbruck.famous for our bollywood movie :Tiger Jinda Hai.",
          "Situated at one end of Herzog Friedrich Strasse, the Golden Roof is a nice monument to admire, particularly on a sunny day. A number of restaurants and cafes are located around the square which enable you to refuel and admire the Roof simultaneously.",
          "An unusual old building standing out in a street o f old buildings .Worth a look when visiting the old town",
          "Museum Goldenes Dachl is a small museum and it can be completed in less then 1 hr. visit to see the unique collection",
          "The Golden Roof is located in the old town of innsbruck and is the best to visit during late evening. it can also get crowed during that time",
          "I was amazed by this beautiful building. It is located right in the middle of a big tourist hub. It is a building you must see if you have the opportunity.",
          "I think the history around the whole roof is more fascinating than the roof itself but there sure are a lot of people taking pictures of it (like me!). Always a crowd there. I wanted to go into the museum about it but it was closed for renovations when I was there. Great people",
          "Not really sure what all the fuzz is about. I didn\u2019t really understand the hype.. it\u2019s super crowded, and it\u2019s really not that special. I guess you have to see it when in town.. but don\u2019t visit Innsbruck especially for this. It\u2019s overrated and pretty boring if you ask me.",
          "Rather disappointed that the place was closed. Lots of people came hoping to visit it. Fortunately there was no scaffolding so people could still take photos if they wish",
          "An historical little palace in the centre of Innsbruck. Very peculiar roof, close to it many ristorants which serve typical austrian food",
          "Famous Innsbruck landmark. Not much to see but it is near excellent restaurants and in a good area to take a break and relax.",
          "Innsbrck is a beautiful town with a charming old town with golden roof.This is a attraction for visitors ..Its history is much more intresting",
          "Not a lot to see here but the history is interesting. Always attracts a number of tourists with cameras.",
          "Innsbruck is a beautiful town with a charming Old Town with the Golden Roof as the central attraction. In every season, Innsbruck is worth a visit. In winter, there is a Christmas Market and a huge number of ski resorts close by. During the remaining time, Innsbruck offers great",
          "The heart of this place Innsbruck lies in the old town. Bedecked by old buildings, this may be a paradise for shoppers. The Golden roof has history attached to it.",
          "Located at the heart of Old Town in Innsbruck, it is considered as the city's most famous structure.",
          "It\u2019s a landmark of the city. This may be of high value for history lovers. But for me this was average.",
          "I collect old picture postcards. Old means from 1893 when Germany first began making them until roughly 1920. After that, the the quality declined and Hallmark began cutting into the market for greeting cards, which until then had been accomplished by postcards. I have many",
          "The place is situated at the very heart of the old town and offers an impressive view of a unique representative architectural monument.",
          "When we reached this area, the whole place was bustling with crowd everywhere. Many restaurants and branded shops surround the area. Restaurants have open air seating arrangements as well. Shops are constructed in a typical Innsbruck-Salzach style and the colourfully decorated",
          "And to be honest, that's what it is! To be fair, we didn't visit the museum but it did feature in alot of our photos, it's very ornate and a beautiful building, it gets super busy around here though so be sure to visit early for the best photos. All the buildings in this part of",
          "Maria-Theresien Strasse ends to the Golden Roof. It is the symbol of the city. It is a nice and unusual balcony, with historical background. I found the buildings along the maria-theresien strasse more interesting. So stop to watch it, take some photos but nothing more. Inside",
          "Grreat if you have the time to wander round and listen, but not enough actual exhibits for the younger visitors to appreciate and better lighting would help to be able to see the exhibits that are there",
          "Iconic landmark located in the busy and narrow streets of Innsbruck. Nice build and maintained golden roof will be a good Photoshop. But getting proper frame is very difficult as the location is crowded with tourists. Lot of street shopping and local shops are available for",
          "Situated in the main square and appears like a duke. You can not overlook it.. never. Though it is only the gold plating of the tiles at the roof that has been done, but it looks good. Definitely a background for your pictures. I didn't go inside the museum so can't comment on",
          "A quirky delight in a beautiful city, I would advise you to get to the centre early if your going to try and get a family photo, because it get pretty busy later on. Innsbruck is a beautiful city in itself and well worth a visit. Top tip catch the little red tram from the main",
          "Always a draw, but this time we went in the Goldenes Dachl museum, which, though small was very interesting. Also, in a thunderstorm, the arcades leading up to it have sheltered shops and cafes !",
          "All the roof tiles are gold gilded. Quite an ornately decorated building from centuries ago. Surrounded by many other historic buildings.",
          "I know that it is a famous landmark but I didn't get it as a child and I don't get it as an adult either. It is boring and not better than the other buildings nearby.",
          "An iconic symbol of this city. The view and the square in which we can find it is so well organized and the museum in it is incredibly well organized, full of stories than summarize the story of the city and the region itself. A very interesting spot and museum that should be a",
          "We saw this downtown as we were shopping. There is some good information about it and it is a good place to take pictures.",
          "We did this trip with kids. The outside of it seems attractive. That's just about it. Its an important landmark in Innsbruck and seems too hyped.",
          "We did this as a family visit with 3 kids, who are used to visiting museums and historical buildings. We really expected more of this. The outside is nice, i won't argue about that. But the inside is a museum with enless amounts of texts and not much to see. We would not visit",
          "To visit the location was a part of our group tour to Innsbruck, Austria. It is must visit place in the old town of Innsbruck. One can have a good time as the Golden Roof building which is in pedestrian area. Very nice location for photo shoot. Lot of Shops and Cafes near the",
          "The old city od Inssbruck is nice and this site is a must, easy to find, but is is not much more than a photo point.",
          "Visiting Innsbruck you have to see the Golden Roof. The building is amazing and is quite easy to find. It's in the pedestrian area and you can see it from the end of the street. Many cafes around it too.",
          "A popular tourist attraction in town. There isn't to many things to see and do so this will definitely be on your list of things to see.",
          "The Goldenes Dachl (golden roof) is somewhat the symbol of Innsbruck, and is at the heart of the touristy altstadt. It is nice to look at, but I don't think most people would visit Innsbruck just to see this. We went on the museum tour, which was reasonably priced, but I found",
          "The Golden Roof ( Goldenes Dachl ) is a unique building and is considered as the symbol of Innsbruck . The gold plated slanting roof which is part of the facade glitters in the sunlight and along with the entrance and balustrade is truly an impressive sight .",
          "This golden roof is located in the city centre of Innsbruck, it is very beautiful and something you should visit if you're in the city. There are many stores and cafes located next to it.",
          "We really enjoyed seeing the golden tiles on this building but the best part is learning all the history of the Golden Roof. You can visit it on the pedestrian side of old town and take pictures and there's no charge at all.",
          "You can't miss this as it is in the main plaza. To really appreciate it though,you need to go inside to the museum and learn about it. We experienced a lovely concert outside by the Austrian army orchestra.",
          "Innsbruck, the capital of the Tyrol, is a very unusual and beautiful city. The city comprises the more 'expensive' area and the old city. If you visit on a Sunday the former is closed, but horse drawn carriage rides are available (at a cost) to show the highlights of the city.",
          "We visited the Golden Roof whilst we had some spare time in Innsbruck, before heading off to the airport. Due to a shortage of time we only managed to view it from the outside. To us, although it was beautiful and nice to see, it was not something that we would consider to be",
          "We not only thought the Goldene Dachl was beautiful from the outside, it\u2019s also beautiful from inside. You can actually step up to the balcony and have the view emperor Maximilian (who commissioned/finished this place) would have had 500 years ago. That alone was worth the few",
          "I was expecting to see something large and totally eye-catching. This was certainly not that. The roof was quite small but also quite beautiful. The history was fascinating. Did not visit the museum inside due to shortage of time.",
          "The roof itself is best seen from outside where you can also see all the murals. We went on a Sunday morning when they also had a brass band playing on the balcony which invoked the sense of a bygone era.",
          "This is an unique land mark which is very interesting but unless you are keen on finding out more about its history and that of the relevant Emperor, Maximilian, you may want to pass on visiting the museum. However we thought the museum was well worth the money because of our",
          "Outside and inside it is nice. Inside you will have audio guide. Unfortunately Hungarian one is not available. If you have got Innsbruck card, than the entrance is free of charge.",
          "The golden roof is visible in the distance. Up close, one can see the beautiful detail in the facade.",
          "Not sure what's inside here as most people just come to see the exterior architecture, which is an impressive sight for sure. If you can visit, I don't know what you'll find.",
          "Austrian Culture showcased, with a band playing very hour ( I guess) . Over all nice place to visit, with lots of souvenir shops.",
          "Located in old town, near DOM and Imperial Palace. For me it\u2019s nothing too special here unless the history. The building (museum) is small and there is no one who manage the flow of people, for example. So, just avoid to come when they have many visitors. Many people only",
          "The Golden Roof itself is impressive from the outside and the inside History was interesting but the actual museum was manly listening to the audio. We accessed it as part of our Innsbruck card and spent 30 minutes there. You could spend longer if you listened to everything.",
          "We saw it and tried to get a good picture but it was too bright. We walked further away for a better picture and found our favourite view of Innsbruck. It's not all about the roof",
          "the history is incredible and that's exactlly what you will see in the picture but overall the place in INNSBRUCK,AUSTRIA is incredibly beautiful place to visit, clean with beautiful architecture and history.",
          "It is certanly worth of seeing, it's in the center of the city so you can't miss it. Make sure to take a picture :D",
          "Very traditional, but also very delicious. I have eaten here 6 times over the last 8 months, and each time was exactly the same, although I sat in different places and enjoyed a different dish every time. One would think that it would fill up with tourists, but not the case, as",
          "There is a love story in the history of this Golden Roof. It was completed in 1500 and decorated with over 2600 fire glazed gilded copper tiles, giving it its golden color. Emperor Maximilian I commissioned it to mark his wedding to Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan, his second wife.",
          "This is quite rightly one of the most famous attractions in Innsbruck: it's a work of art and you can feel the history of the old town. That being said, paying to go in to the (for want of a better word) 'museum' probably isn't worth it. The exhibits are quite poor and you'll",
          "I had heard about the Golden Roof prior to travelling to Innsbruck by train from St Anton. It was a warm sunny Saturday morning and it was quiet so good for pictures . It is worth paying \u20ac4.60 to go in the museum below and then look out onto the street just as the king would",
          "The place was amazing. This roof is just like it is from a fairytale. It worths visiting if you ever visit Austria!!",
          "I have visited the Innsbruck and the Golden Roof. It is very beautiful place and I like the ambience very much. The shops and the restaurans near Golden Roof makes the place more enjoyable.",
          "Located in a nice cobblestoned square with restaurants and shops. Beautiful in daylight with snowy peaks in background. Lovely for romantic walks around Innsbruck",
          "It's a lovely building but my rating is based on the exterior being the best bit. the inside is a museum devoted to the life of Maximilian; quite interesting in it's own way but unlikely to entertain a young person or someone who's not into historical characters. By all means",
          "The Golden roof is fairly small and is not particularity spectacular, but its worth stopping for photos if you are exploring the old town of Innsbruck.",
          "If wandering through the main streets of Innsbruck it\u2019s hard to miss this building. I would\u2019ve liked to have spent more time to explore Innsbruck but if short on time the Golden Roof is worth stopping by for at least a few holiday snaps.",
          "Best time to see is in. New year where brass bands play from the. Golden roof and other famous buildings in the. Altstadt. Innsbruck amazing mediaeval building in the. Altstadt. Old Schloss. And cellars. Amazing history back to 1400,s. Hot gluhwein sold in cups and scraps",
          "Not all that spectacular, but worth an hour of your time at best. Replete with local history so important if you're really into the Tyrolean story.",
          "The audio guide is included and if you punch in the highlights you learn a bit about Innsbruck history and the roof history and there is a brief film on Maximilian. You get to look out the balcony as well. Takes 30-40 minutes and you feel you learned more about the area.",
          "It's pretty and old but there's not very much to it. You'd expect it to be a full roof but it's only the roof over an elaborate bay window.",
          "The Golden Roof is impossible to miss because it is situated in the heart of the old town of the city. It is not the most beautiful thing to do in the town, but you must see it because it is it is very special.",
          "Beautiful and lovely. So gorgeous both outside and inside. When going inside, you will see a little museum about the roof and it\u2019s history.",
          "Impressive roof - and the chance to see it and the murals close up by going in the museum. There's a small exhibition inside too on the first floor and the chance to learn more about the local history. Free entry with the Innsbruck card.",
          "If you want a potted history of Maximilian 1 and the development of the Holy Roman Empire, plus how Innsbruck came to be important in Central Europe, do visit this. The museum is well laid out, has a very interesting film show and some gorgeous exhibits - in particular",
          "Not bad, in the middle of town. Easy to find day or night. But you end up spending about 5 minutes looking at it and move on. The mountains are the main attraction.",
          "I am not a massive museum fan but this was just small enough to keep my interest for maybe 45 mind to 1hr. Audio guide in several languages available, which was useful. There are lots of attractive old buildings nearby, but this is the main attraction i guess. Of course you can",
          "The Goldenes Dachl means The Golden Roof is a landmark structure located in the Old Town section of Innsbruck, Austria. It\u2019s in the heart of Innsbruck, in one of the main squares, surrounded by shops. It was OK. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s amazing, as I visited marvelous Golden Temple",
          "Really love the golden roof. It\u2019s in the heart of Innsbruck, in one of the main squares and was built in the 1500c. It\u2019s so quaint surrounded by shops and you can imagine it being used as a verandah in years gone by. It has a museum which is really good and entry is included",
          "Not the most interesting of museums but the audio guide certainly gives you more perspective and context, situated in the old town and unmistakable as you cant miss the golden roof.",
          "It's a nice place though it was covered with snow but you can still see the golden roof Lots of shops beside",
          "Worth a visit for the location alone (lovely square in the old town) and interesting to learn about the building itself. And don\u2019t forget your camera!",
          "we learned about the building of the city, the history of the monarchy' love and war giving us a lot to talk after the visit/",
          "Amazing historical buildings all around the old town, but this Dachl is beautiful. Often the buildings have the age, and date they were renovated near the top.",
          "We spent 2 days in Innsbruck in July and walked by the Golden Roof several times during our stay. While it's very touristy and crowded during the day, it empties out around sunset, and you can take good photos. The roof photographs beautifully at night as it's well lit.",
          "this is a very small museum you can go round in 30 mins you do get a view from balcony free with Innsbruck card",
          "A must see in Innsbruck. Especially the square and the surroundings make this a tourist attraction. Especially in the Christmas period this is a romantic place. You can also visit the museum and the Swarovski shop. Very sorry that there is already a McDonald's on this square.",
          "This building is very beautiful but once you go in it is really just another museum. We visited as we enjoy interesting architecture and this is well worth seeing.",
          "Everybody gets curious: is it really made of gold? The answer is yes and no (not solid gold, but gold covered). The interesting fact is that it has been protected by the citizens during WW2.",
          "Hard to imagine something to beautiful to still be there after so many centuries...but it's an impressive gold roof over a balcony porch. The porch was used by 15th century local dignitaries to watch over the masses in the markets below, offering cooler temperatures in the",
          "This is the highlight of Innsbruck. It's easily reachable on foot from the Innsbruck main station. This monument is adjacent to the Maria Theresien Street. En route you also find Mac D which comes handy when one is travelling with kids. The monument as such is not so great but",
          "Not much to see. The roof was bright gold, yes, but as such not a very memorable experience. More beautiful was the building opposite with its pastel-coloured ornaments. Location, however, is very near to the dome, so walking by is something to consider.",
          "Opposite the golden roof at Xmas is a huge Christmas tree with lights. At 5 o\u2019clock a brass band situated in the balcony plays carols for 30-40 minutes. Mulled wine and sausage about. Great atmosphere, but no carol singing?",
          "Excellent audio visual displays provide a good understanding of the history of Innsbruck. The Golden Roof is in the heart of town in a beautiful setting.",
          "One of the mosg visited place in Innsbruck. The place has a different vibe and its amazing to see golden roof with golden tiles surrounded by ancient hundred year old buildings. One must visit early in morning to see sunrays shining on roof.",
          "There is a Christmas Market in front of Goldenes Dachl. Very nice atmosphere. We didn\u2019t enter the Goldenes Dachl museum. it located in the center of the old town, worth to visit and explore.",
          "To learn the history and really understand more about Innsbruck then yes a worthwhile trip and it's small so do it with the Innsbruck card.Great little view and,a sweet gift shop.",
          "Must see when in Innsbruck. Stunning facade and interesting history about this old building. plenty more to see in the Alt Stadt so do go.",
          "The Golden Roof is situated in the old part of town in one of the many pedestrian walkways where you also find the Christmas market stalls. The Golden Roof is a fancy balcony with a golden roof.",
          "Sorry dont really see the attraction. There are more interesting sites and sights to see in the area.",
          "Our hotel happened to be on the same street as the golden roof, but there\u2019s nothing really special about this building, and it\u2019s not really worth going out of your way to see it",
          "O Golden Roof \u00e9 um ponto tur\u00edstico um pouco decepcionante: apenas um telhado pequeno pintado de dourado, no meio da pra\u00e7a. The Golden Roof is a somewhat disappointing tourist spot: just a small roof painted in gold in the middle of the square.",
          "Set in a nice square. This facade is fun too look at, but I found it overhyped. Not sure what the fuss is all about",
          "Centrally located in innsbruck is this historical monument with lot of work of gold. It is marvellous piece of architecture and has lot of emblems where they ruled. Part of all the walk tours and please be with a guide to knkw the history",
          "It is the most well recognised landmark in old town, it looks nice, but really didn't understand what is the big deal about it. Click a photo and move on.",
          "I hadn\u2019t been here since 1966 but walking the old streets at night brought back forgotten memories. Tucked away between bigger buildings there it was the golden roof. Nothing spectacular but a must see in a must see city. The locals walk by without a thought but check out the",
          "Closed Mondays - the only day I had free to go - and I had the Innsbruck card so had entry paid :( Not the best idea in an international tourist town. Maybe do the cleaning at night?",
          "One more place for being the centre point of the city, golden roof is nothing big, but yes the final place where all the souvenir shops and malls in the vicinity..",
          "An iconic image of Innsbruck! Your entrance allows you to stand behind the roof and look at the images in mirrors and to go through the museum. The English audio aid is great and we really enjoyed this visit!",
          "I guess this is worth a quick walk past to take a photo. We went into their museum and had a look around. It has a lot of historic facts around the building of the balconey with the golden roof tiles (really copper), added on to the existing building by Maximilian 1, around",
          "We visited the Golden roof on a few occasions as apart from being an old city tourist attraction, it is situated amongst other interesting sights. It is unique, different and certainly gold.",
          "I can only speak for the outside... I didn't go in the building... The square where the roof is is quite impressive though, its pretty much the hub of the town, you will see the roof... its just there... doesnt reeeally add a ton to the experience.",
          "Came to see the roof while doing a walking tour of the old town. I thought the roof was going to be a bit bigger than what it was but glad I\u2019ve seen it now.",
          "beautiful work of art,mesmerizing view, from far & near. Main attraction for all photographers enjoy clicking away",
          "Our first destination in the Old Town of Innsbruck was to view the Golden Roof. Touted as the most famous symbol of Innsbruck, it held the \"A\" designation on our Sightseer Hop on-Hop off map. The structure was ornately decorated, but Goldenes Dachl was simply a roof with copper",
          "Right in the square of old town..lovely to walk about and a beautiful sight to admire. Would recommend sitting in one of the cafes for coffee just to relax and enjoy the view",
          "The Golden Roof was built in the early 15th century but the roof isn't golden - it's actually 2,657 fire-gilded copper tiles! It sits in the middle of the square - so hard to miss it. Personally I'd say save your money and skip the museum itself unless you're really into Emperor",
          "I\u2019m still wondering why no one built a golden balcony for me when I got married!!!!y iconic place in the center of Innsbruck",
          "The museum does a very good presentation on the life and times of Maximilian 1. If that is not of interest then it is not worth the entrance fee. The roof and decorations are adequately viewed from outside.",
          "As the \"walk-free day\" on or hiking trip to Austria, our bus took us to Innsbruck and a glance of the world famous city. The golden roof was part of the bucket list, but unfortunately we were not overly impressed. There are many fantastic buildings in Innsbruck and of course the",
          "The narrow cobblestone streets, vintage architecture, varity of street performers, it's like walking through a movie scene!",
          "This was on our list of sites to see, but decided seeing it from outside was enough. It is an interesting building with great detail. I agree with others that it was not very exciting, but easy to observe from outside while you are enjoying Innsbruck.",
          "it is a must visit for all the tourists.....The view behind the roof is amazing in winters when the mountains are all snowy.",
          "Very small roof in the main pedestrian street, very obvious but not quite shinning, the museum has nothing much in it, takes 1 min to look at from the outside.",
          "It's nice to see, it's in the old town, easy to visit and only takes a few minutes. There are plaques with info in the square which give you a pretty good idea of the history.",
          "This is one of those things that you need to glance at because it is there. It is not wildly exciting, and your life will not be the worse if you never see it.",
          "The museum explains about the history of the Goldenes Dachl, the builder Maximilian and the town of Innsbruck and Tyrolia. It is small but well explained. Very educational.",
          "The balcony is pretty cool and you easily see this sight in 10-15 min. Pretty much downtown, it would be hard to miss on your trip. Worth the stop",
          "We visited the Golden Roof museum. It had some interesting exhibits about the use of the building across the years. The most informative thing was the movie about the Emperor Maximilian, and the room that followed that contained some artifacts of his. There is an audio guide",
          "The place was just 2 minutes walk from our hotel. As it was raining continuously, we just went to take few photos. Nothing great but bcoz it is a famous monument we went to see it.",
          "This is a balcony on the side of a building. It has a legend of gold tiles being put on the rook for a wedding. Worth a look.",
          "This is really overrated, but is probably unique. Certainly if you are in the square, you (and several hundred others) will look at it, take a photo and can mark it off your list. It does not really do anything, just hangs there.",
          "I am a bit confounded that this attraction can command such a number of tourist coming to Innsbruck, mostly for this sight alone. This balcony, built in the year 1500, is undeniably a beautiful sight, and adds to any tourist's trip photographs, but still...it's just one part of",
          "Beautiful old houses surrounded by cafees and shops, the golden roof is indeed an eye catching house front and with a lot of history",
          "A beautiful place to walk, do some shopping, enjoy the elegant ladies and the well decorated houses. I do hope you will hit a nice weather for in a hot day it's can became very uncomfortable place.",
          "We've been in Innsbruck on our honeymoon. And I liked this place so much because of the romantic story with this balcony.",
          "A pretty picture in the middle of town. Wedged between a very normal looking building with lovely flower filed balconies.",
          "One of the most noticeable houses in Innsbruck Altstad, the golden roof is very impressive. The facade of the roof structure is fabulous, you don't need to be mad about architecture to see the beauty in it.",
          "Only good part was the walk around the area over all everything is same you can see mini swarsoki crystal world around that area",
          "As you are walking through the Innsbruck streets, in one plaza you will notice the golden roof. You must take a picture. Almost out of place to be in the plaza. Kind of a Chinese flair and has wonderful paintings.",
          "One of the teens accompanying me during the stroll through the old town stated clearly his perception: \"what an ugly kitsch\". Seeing the general influence the golder roof has on the observers, my son is an obvious exception - it is a really a convincing evidence of the",
          "On a sunny day you can't miss it... the golden roof can be seen from far... it does attract your attention, but it is just something to look at shortly and then you move on... After the first moment it quickly loses it's spell.... it's neighbour is more interesting and forces",
          "When you visit here to see the roof which is interesting but the best are the streets in the area lots of good resturants and views.",
          "Although there were tons of people outside taking photos, not nearly so many actually went in to go through the museum. We spent about an hour walking through. If you like history, you'd love the museum. There were a lot of photos and print/audio explanations. It was free with",
          "This a good (average) museum to visit. Entry is free with the Innsbruck card. Plan to spend about 45 minutes there.",
          "The Golden Roof along with Maria Theresien Strasse are probably the prime landmarks of the city. This is a gold plated roof of a 16th century balcony which served as the Emperor's \"royal box\". It is located in the Old Town at the foot/head of the pedestrian Herzog-Friedrich",
          "In the main square,the golden roof is the highlight of the busy square.All the window balconies are full of flowers. and I think you can go in as there is a museum. ?",
          "Have visisted here so many times. A must see but hardly outstanding. Smaller than you might imagine but the whole area is definately worth spending time here.",
          "Hello, This one is a very old historical building in Innsbruck. Except Golden Roof there is no attraction but old building looks nice. It is a tourist attraction so there is crowd always in front of this building. Tourist take photographs of this building. But you should not",
          "Can't miss it if you ever visit Innsbruck downtown. The local Swarovski store has beautiful pieces of rich glass art.",
          "A very popular attraction in the old town with a small museum, A good talking point, but not the only thing to see and do in the old town. Plenty of shops and restaurants in the area which helps you once you have viewed the golden roof.",
          "We even saw a wedding couple on this occasion. It is nice to have seen but maybe I was expecting more. They use this building as a center of attraction, right after the couple they started to put up a stage for later that evening.",
          "A visit to Innsbruck is incomplete with a quick visit to see the Goldenes Dachl. The Golden Roof (in the old town) is a landmark structure completed in 1500. The roof tiles are not gold but fire-gilded copper tiles. Now that I have seen the golden roof I feel I have \u201cdone\u201d",
          "Great to view from the outside, with a small museum inside. It can be very busy in this area and is a great wedding shotting area.",
          "If you decide to walk through old town, you will see the Golden Roof. It's a roof and it has gold shingles. That's it. Please don't make a special trip to see this. It's no big deal.",
          "Since this is like a place to visit in Innsbruck, we went. Yup, roof is golden after all. But I'm more interested in the architecture and the history of it. The walk around the area makes it more enjoyable with many shops and interesting things/buildings to see.",
          "There was nothing spectacular about this place. Looks exactly as the photographic uploaded by other reviewers. What's nice is different nearby shops and restaurants. I wouldn't place this spot on my top list of places to visit: at best, it should be the last stop on the way back",
          "Good place to hang out in the evening... Couple of museums nearby... Cafe's and street shopping, where u can purchase soveniers and traditional clocks.. sarvoski showroom also there",
          "Every historic town has its trade mark. The Tower Bridge of London, the Eiffel Tower of Paris, the Colosseum of Rome and to keep closer to Innsbruck, the Lindwurm of Klagenfurt. The building with the Golden Roof is that trade mark of Innsbruck and is therefore a \"must visit\"",
          "This is a landmark in the Old Town section of Innsbruck. It is not really a roof at all, but more of just a small overhang. The shingles are not gold, but gilded copper. It is worth stopping for a photo. Inside there is a museum that offers additional information.",
          "A nice old house from the time of Emperor Maximilian. Very nice. Visit the museum inside as it gives soul to history.",
          "Will rate this as an average experience as there is hardly anything to see. Finished the entire museum in 20 minutes",
          "The Golden roof is one of the major highlights of this quaint old town .. it's pretty but photos don't really capture it and we were only in town a very short time. We stopped in town for about an hour and i spent most of it in crystal shops helping the local economy.",
          "Good if you want to know the History of Innsbruck. Inside is more informative than pretty. You can get nice pictures of the outside for free if you don't want to go in.",
          "Fascinating aristocratic building in the old Town , peculiar for the Golden tiles of the roof. It is said that the emperor used to assist to events from this balcony.",
          "Don't worry too much about the Golden Roof - its 'nice' but nowt to write home about but the rest of the old town of Innsbruck is simply magical. There is so much to see. The architecture is wonderful and there are stunning buildings around every corner. Climb the Tower for a",
          "a tourist attraction due to unique Golden roof and historical background. has some very good cafes and nearby tourist attractions",
          "Visited as a meeting point for RIVIERA TRAVEL. As mentioned elsewhere, the roof tiles are in fact made from malleable Copper (coated to look like gold). During my free time, I gawped at the Swarovski showroom nearby (see photo), visited Innsbruck's two Modern Art Galleries, and",
          "If you go to Innsbruck you have to wind through the old narrow streets and you will therefore come under the golden roof at some point. It is therefore a must, but some might say it is just a roof. When we were there sipping coffee in a cafe below a group of musicians came and",

          "I was bit disappointed . I visited the place looking forward to something grand . But it's okay. Nothing special.. but the market place around and the swarovski showroom is good",
          "I grew up in Vienna but moved away as a teenager so I never thought I would see the Goldenes Dachl. We learnt about it at primary school and I was always fascinated by the thought of it as a child. I went on a day trip to Innsbruck with my parents and brother while on a skiing",

          "Popped in here to spend a wet afternoon whilst other members of our party were elsewhere in the city. Compared to some of the other city museums, the entry price for what we wanted was reasonable. It was good to be able to get a closer look at some of the decoration on the",
          "This Gothic building looks out of place when you first see it, as it appears to have been swallowed by the buildings surrounding it. The plaque on the front gives an account of how and when it was built and there is a museum inside.",
          "Numerous tourists were taking their selfies here as it is the city's most famous symbol. Located in the Old Town.",
          "This is apparently the thing to see here. It's a roof! And it's golden! Gooooooooooold. We read the sign beneath the roof and it's actually copper :/",
          "Impossible to miss as it's on the most elegant street of Innsbruck and with the golden tiles literally glows in the sunshine. The late-Gothic palace of the Counts of the Tyrol were especially interesting to me because of the connection between Maximillian I of Asburg and Bianca",
          "You are not allowed to take pics - for me a huge turnoff :D ... but yeah, there wasn't anything THAT interesting, I mean you get an insight to history, and how this crazy guy wants to preserve his memory in art :D (that sounds like me lol) but meh. Didn't really leave a truly",

          "Myeah it's a roof. I guess the story makes it interesting but honestly just look at the picture. I enjoyed Innsbruck though!",

          "Located at the center of the old town, the golden roof looks really impressive and cool as a token of the rich Tyrol history. If you are taking a walk in the old town, you can't miss it !!",
          "The golden roof as part of a balcony made around the year 1500 for Emperor Maximilian I and his wife is a famous touristic attraction in the old town of Innsbruck. The roof is made of copper with a film of gold and could be considered as The symbol of Innsbruck. But don't",
          "The history up and down the streets of Innsbruck is amazing. You must be on your toes because there are plaques up and down the street. Each building has one and will tell you a bit about the building you are walking past. The Goldenes Dachl is a must see....so beautiful and",

          "This Golden Roof is where the center of the tourist district in town is located, there was an Easter market in the square below it when I was in town. This area is interesting as there are many shops and alot is going on, however the Golden Roof was beautiful but otherwise not",
          "WOW!!! The nature called while walking in the old town Innsbruck. I didn't see any \"WC\" sign anywhere but Saw the museum. Thought \"they would certainly let me use the toilet\". A red haired older woman gladly showed me out the door somewhere else. I told her it was quite urgent.",

          "It's very hard to miss this one while visiting Innsbruck, as it is on the central square of the town. We visited around Christmas time, and carolers on the balcony played Christmas songs while the Golden Roof was lightened up, making for a very beautiful show! Definitely worth",

          "It is a small building but with a lot of features. Put yourself in front of the building and observe all the paintings and carvings.",
          "This is a well known and famous landmark but i just couldnt help but feel a little underwhelmed by it",
          "Probably the most visited place in Innsbruck and justifiably so. A fabulous example of an oriel window with beautiful painting.",
          "This is one place in innsbruck that gives you a feel of the old town,just a few feet away is the golden adler hotel which is the oldest hotel in the world.",
          "Just a roof, not much to tell about. It is fun to see, but would not take some extra time out of my day to see it. Not even sure what the entrance fee is for as your best view is from the outside.",
          "We enjoyed this attraction very much as we had an audio guide in English and we each listened to the parts which most interested us. It gave a great insight into the history of Innsbruck.",
          "No biggie. It's pretty, it's gold, it's tiny. But we don't understand what the fuzz is about. Would def not go to Inssbruck just for the roof. Tge city is really nice though.",
          "it is interesting to see how some of the buildings are as they were originally and how some have been have been mingled together , as the years have rolled by.",
          "A beautiful monument and the perfect centre piece to the beautiful Innsbruck old town. Every street that you take returns you to the Golden Roof.",
          "But the point for which Innsbruck is famous. Without Max 1 it would not have much to show I guess. The museum is included in the card.",
          "Looks nice, mountains behind, accessible from high street...not much to mention on this one. Surrounded by mostly souvenir shops and a few bakeries.",
          "You haven't been in Innsbruck if you haven't seen Goldenes Dachl. The whole old town is such a nice place to stole around. Grab a coffee enjoy looking at all the sights and feel the wings of history. Not the cheapest place to eat and drink, but why not spoil yourself?",
          "A historical building that's kept as it was, in the middle of other modified buildings. Located in the middle of the city and free to access.",
          "Very historical, and right in the centre of the old town. Do visit the museum behind for more information.",
          "This is right in the main square and is worth visiting to see the roof and to get a photo or two. Behind the building is a view of the alps which is quite lovely.",
          "This roof is unique in that is gold, but the back drop of the Alps is a one of a kind sight. Could not get enough of the view.",
          "Waystres isn't friendly but try to help us with meals. Location is good but the food was worst, no taste no quality",
          "We stayed right near the centre and The Golden Roof was only a 5 minute walk away beautiful to see the old structure worth a little pit stop.",
          "Visited the Golden roof during our short stopover in Innsbruck. Easy to find and quite pleasant to stroll around especially in the evenings with lesser crowd. There were also Christmas market around and souvenir shops which still opens after 6pm. Not to be missed!",
          "Visit the place around end of Nov. They are having Christmas market and it was great! The locals are friendly!! Some might not speak English well but they try to make sure you understand them. Food is great too!! The shops around are pretty unique (personal pinion) and a pretty",

          "The Golden roof was somewhat underwhelming for me. A small area covered with tiles glazed by copper, or some other metal but not gold. The surrounding area is a shopping area free of traffic. It seemed somewhat designed for tourists, but I enjoyed walking the cobblestones and",
          "Lovely and happening place during Christmas holiday. Kids fun activities, great shopping district, tourist attractions.",
          "It's a beautiful part of the local architecture and history. You won't stay there for long if you are just there to see the roof, but there is a live band that usually plays under the roof which is lovely. We visited during Christmas, so we had the lovely chance of visiting the",
          "A nice traditional restaurant at good prices, a large menu with Austrian specialties so lots to voice from. Would recommend.",
          "It's a gold ish roof, you can't really miss it if you wander around. Had a great night in the square and markets near there, lovely with lights etc. at Xmas. Vibist the town but not for he roof, nice to see but not worth a trip on its own. We loved Innsbruck.",
          "Beautiful but just a part of the building. It is however well worth visiting and is in the main old town area.",
          "Nice little place to see at Innsbruck! We were happy was not so crowded and we could make some pictures! Worth to visit",
          "My family visited Innsbruck and were enchanted with the architecture, the infamous Golden Roof, the artists, and the fairy tale characters lining the streets. The children told the stories they learned in German kindergarten and pointed out each character as we walked. A day,",
          "lovely building worth a few minutes. It is at the end of Maria Theresenstrasse (shopping street and Christmas market street in December). In Christmas season there is live Christmas music at 5:30 from an upper floor of this building.",
          "Not much to see here, i believe the beauty of Innsbruck is in the picturesque views of the Tyrolean region! Visited in late Nov 2015.",
          "Viewed the Golden Roof as we explored downtown area of Austria on Christmas Day. Several of the shops and street vendors were open even though it was a holiday. Beautiful views from all directions!",
          "Whilst wandering around the lovely old town area you cannot miss this 'Golden Roof', very ornate and gleaming in the sun. You can get a great 'birds-eye' view of it from the tower nearby.",
          "Because this is the biggest site in Innsbruck, there is always a crowd there. There are people, usually crowds taking pictures in front of it so it can be difficult to take a full picture of it.",
          "We were in Innsbruck Sunday,Dec.12, 2016 for the Christmas Market along with literally thousands of other Italians. The bus park was full to overflowing and flights were coming in from Bari,Naples and other southern cities. In spite of all this Innsbruck has the capacity to",
          "The Goldenes Dachl was designed to serve as a royal box where the Emperor and his imperial entourage could sit in state and enjoy festivals, tournaments, and other events that took place in the square below. The Goldenes Dachl was built in honor of Maximilian's marriage to",
          "Yes, do the less obvious on holiday, but do see this most famous of sights. The Goldenes Dachl is steeped in the history of the city. When we were there we had the advantage of having an Advent Market in front too.",
          "Not as exciting as I imagine but strongly suggest opting for a guide who will explain the exquisite story of why it is there. Will not appreciate the meaning without the story telling.",
          "important attraction especially on christmas.its impressive and should be visited by everyone.the narrow streets which lead there are also very nice",
          "This was the centerpiece of the Christmas market stalls of the village. There was a live 4 piece band playing Austrian carols on the balcony of the Golden Roof the evening we were in town. The ambiance and beauty of the twinkling lights reflecting on it was just stunning!",
          "It's amazing to see how well preserved it is after so many years! Built circa 1500! We had the pleasure to see a local brass band playing Christmas songs from the balcony! Was very nice.",
          "We arrived just in time to get a table. In fact, had my daughter not excused herself for the moment, I would have offered to let another English speaking couple share our table with us. I didn't want to make that decision on my own. Sometimes Mother/daughter relationships can",
          "If I wouldn't have seen this spot on TripAdvisor I would've passed it without noticing it. Anyhow it is nice to see.",
          "About 30 seconds to view it. Don't spend much more time than that to find it. The area around it is interesting. Did not go in. Maybe that would have made it worthwhile. Get a table at the corner restaurant and have a coffee and strudel and watch tourists looking at the roof",
          "My wife and I stood in awe of this hidden treasure, a true golden moment. It also helped that we had a tour guide that explained the story behind it. Some to go and see. Should be on the must do list.",
          "Golden roof.is in the old part of town..has a small museum... cute old town...everything is walking distance..all the attractions can be seen 2-3hours...",

          "The golden roof is one of Innsbruck's most famous attractions having been completed in 1500. It was decorated with 2738 golden tiles to commemorate the wedding of Emperor Maximillion I however naturally after all this time the colour is not as brilliant. It is not large however",
          "I guess if you have never been to Innsbruck before then this is somewhere you should come and see for yourself. Don't imaging it's going to be bright gold - it's rather warn over the years. It's is located in a pedestrian area in the city and is surrounded by stunning buildings",
          "It is a beautiful place. I wish all the roofs were like this... ;) Especially the roof of my house... Please visit! :)",
          "The golden roof is a highlight of the city, only one thing is that you can overlook it because the roof itself is not that big! Still very pretty to see and to take a picture of!",
          "Worth a walk through historic Innsbruk old town centre and it becomes easy to imagine the ancient Roman/ Medieval history.",
          "The must see attraction, and the symbol of the city. Lots of nice shopping and places to eat nearby.You can't miss it.",
          "In the heart of Innsbruck with a lot of restaurants and coffee places around is a must see in Innsbruck",

          "Our tour guide showed us the golden roof and explained it history. It was very interesting and the old town tour is well worth a visit.",
          "We walked to see the Golden Roof, and we were able to enter the museum for free using our Innsbruck card. The golden roof is considered one of the most famous symbols of Innsbruck, it was completed in 1500 and decorated with 2738 gold tiles to commemorate the wedding of Emperor",
          "Not much to say here, the Goldene Dachl is nice and all but try to go there in a calm time, ratjer early in the morning for example. Otherwise it is going to be very crowded",
          "If you are in Innsbruck then a visit to the Golden Roof is a must. It is the highlight of the city and a picture with it and the Alps in the background make for a wonderful photo opportunity. The Golden roof was the balcony area of the royal palace from where the King and Queen",
          "You can't be in Innsbruck without visiting the golden roof. I would suggest visiting it in the evening. Get directions from the hotel staff if you are not sure. It is however, a small building. Got to pay attention to the building. But once you are within the vicinity, you",
          "Make sure not just to look at the roof from the outside. There is a very nice small museum located in the city building where the roof is. It's nice and small but has a good audio tour of the history of the city and the roof. It's an hour well spent. Free with the Innsbruck",
          "If you visit Innsbruck you just have to visit the Golden Roof. It certainly is something special especially if you are lucky enough to see it in the sunshine. It is what it is, golden. The other thing to mention is that it is also in the centre of the old town so just as",
          "You can't be in Innsbruck without visiting the golden roof. Settled in the beautiful old town, I reccomend visiting it in the evening, near thd sunset hour, because the light is more orange and gives the building a beautiful hue.",
          "So stunning and opulent ... The Golden Roof Museum is also in the same building as the Roof belongs to. The exposition was very interesting too, I liked the Golden Roof project with a message on the golden paper, shaping the form of the Roof. You can see it in the video room. An",
          "Museum on one floor gives extensive history of Innsbruck and why the \"golden roof\". The audio guides give extensive information so if time limited listen a bit and move on.",
          "Very tiny part of Innsbruck, and if you do not pay attention, you will miss it.. The roof is very tiny",
          "It is perfect for the people who loves to take pictures like me! It was very crowded but it has one of the best views and an interesting past in the history of Innsbruck. From here you can walk through the narrow streets with lots of shopping and little culinary places. If",
          "Not sure the back story to it, we probably should have read up on it. But it is neat to see, and that's about it!",
          "Ok so it's something shiny in the sky on a sunny afternoon with the reflection of the sun. Other than being a unique landmark, the style does not at all fit in with the architecture of the area. We didn't go inside as we had spectacular weather and remained outdoors.",
          "Somewhat underwhelming nevertheless a nice centerpiece of the pedestrian zone. Overall a very lovely town and well worth a visit. Linger in one of the caf\u00e9s and watch the multitude stroll by.",
          "One of the most crowded place in Innsbruck. The place is full with restaurent and people use to spend time over there with glass of wine.",
          "Set at the end of a lovely thoroughfare the Golden Roof is well worth a visit. No fee, view from the street and able to take photos of this wonderful roof.",
          "I'd suggest to see this famous landmark only if 'you're in the area' ... it looks great & is for sure a historical masterpiece ... it won't 'knock you out of your socks' though to be quite honest (it's, of course, a subjective opinon)",
          "The roof itself is just that - a golden roof covering the sloped side and front of a building facing into a city square. It's free to pass by and have a look at, and usually there are quite a few crowds of people looking at it. Inside, there's also a museum. It's worthwhile",
          "With a tour group it is more amazing. ... to hear the history of the who, why, when it was built, etc. My first time here I was on a tour. Our leader explained its history and we were in awe. This time, with my grown son and his friend I was the tour guide. Apparently,",
          "We visited on a friday morning and sadly we couldn't get any great pictures because the streets right in front of it were crowded with delivery trucks. What a shame. The roof itself is pretty to look at.",
          "A pretty sight on the tourist trail but not much to it. The museum inside is quite small but it allows you a closer look at the balconey. If you have an Innsbruck card, it's worth a look but otherwise a picture outside will do.",
          "Must see in Innsbrook, part of the past and right in the middle of the shopping areas, across from the city tower and around the corner from. St, Jakob's church. You can see all within 300 feet of each other",
          "Very pretty and impressive to see! Must be able to stand somewhat of a slight distance to get full impact of the sight!",
          "It is a must but of course, during the day, the area is extremely busy with day tourists and the various restaurants, cafes and konditorei.",
          "It's a historical architecture in the old town. Not much to view inside. The place is best enjoyed wile sitting in the cafes next to this spot. Many tourists come and go taking countless selfies. If you are lucky than you may find artists who dress like statues and perform for",
          "But every year she probably said, \"but what have you done for me lately?\" Of course you have to see this while in Innsbruck.",
          "When the sun hits the roof you KNOW it. It is locatedin the Tyrolean mountains. Walk through the medieval lanes to see Emperor Maximilian's treasured roof.",
          "charming, has a love story but nothing visually sensational...for true lovers of historical details or artefacts...",
          "The roof itself is... In good condition? Yes. Historical monument? Yes. Well maintained? Yes. But what makes it popular is the area around it which is always busy. Check.",
          "It is a little golden colour roof of a balcony in the inner city of Innsbruck. If we had not already read about it before our arrival we would have easily missed it. It is actually more of a landmark with some history attached to it than some amazing architecture. The roof, made",
          "The Golden Roof is an Innsbruck icon. It is in the centre of the old city which makes it very easy to get to. The gold roof tiles glitter in the sun - not so much when it's cloudy and raining.",
          "Nice fun fact about the golden roof - the tile are actually made of brass :-) but other than that, a lovely landmark in the middle of the city, where once kaiser could stand and look at his subjects!",
          "Must see from the outside but the museum is very dense so good if you want that but may not be interesting for all visitors. There is a children's room with activities though.",
          "I was having a high expectation of the golden roof found it a small balcony canopy of golden color (not actually gold ) a bit disappointed the old town around it was nice but nothing spectacular.other attraction is funicular and swarovski museum",
          "The area around the Golden Roof is great in winter. It is surrounded by christmas markets with lots of Gluhwein. I thought i had passed my stay without seeing the golden roof. 6 months later while browsing online i found out that my phone background screen was actually a",
          "If you visit Innsbruck, you definitely have to have seen the golden roof. Just because it's the most popular site here and it represents an important part of Austria's history. Furthermore, it's in the middle of the oldest part of the town which is literally one of the most",
          "You can easily find this golden roof in the inner city of Innsbruck. It's quite beautiful, but also quite small.",
          "The golden roof is on the balcony that overlooks the square below. The king can sit and view the scene below. It has nice collection of various artifacts.",
          "visited on 16/7 with family visited as a part of a tour group the walk through the garden was very good good old town on the way sceneary around too good, old buildings with ornamental balconies don's forget to eat local made ice cream on the way back",
          "This roof is made of gold, otherwise there is nothing great about it. people kept staring at it but i did not find it much attractive, good restaurents around it though",
          "I visited this some years ago and appreciated the craftsmanship associated with it. It is a treasure in a busy area of the city.",
          "A picture say more than a thousand words. Of course you must pass and view the golden roof, take a picture and see the rest of the Altstadt. However what more can you tell about a house with a golden roof.",
          "Ok so by all means do not make a special trip to Innsbruck just to see the Golden Roof. It's simple a small gold roof. Really no big deal. About 40 seconds is more than enough time to view. With that said, the surrounding downtown area is very nice, so just included it with the",
          "The roof itself is really no big deal. However, it's in downtown Innsbruck which is very cool to walk around in. Very picturesque.",
          "We had a limited time at Innsbruck as it was just a lunch stopover so can't say much about the place except the very nice backdrop of the alps. I was a bit disappointed of the Golden Roof. I thought it was bigger than that. Oh well, the history behind it might be more",
          "This only take a few minutes to look at and take a picture, but since we were walking around town anyway we sought it out. It is one of those things that if you are in the area you need to go see it. It was fun knowing the history of the roof, Emperor Maximilian I had it made",
          "Stroll along the shops and enjoy the old buildings. Stop for a lunch or a coffee with waffels (tradition).",
          "There is little to see - look it up online ad you have seen it all. However, it is a nice part of a walk through historic Innsbruck and at the intersection of some nice old and narrow lanes and the main street. Don't miss it but don't expect to be blown away.",
          "It's very very busy during the day and if you'd like a nice photo visit early morning as from around 930am the tour buses turn up and you will struggle to get a decent photo. On the two days we were there a man (Street busker) was pretending to be a gold statue and place himself",
          "This place is more like a shopping street. CLOSED ON SUNDAY. Give you feel that you are walking on historical paths which have new age store and brands. i found Souvenirs at cheapest price is comparison to any other place i visited in my europe trip. If you are planning to visit",
          "It is a roof with gold paint. Very sparkly in the sun. Lots of tourist cafes and shops surrounding it. Good for positioning yourself",
          "We stayed in the centre of the old town and could see the Golden Roof upon leaving our hotel, I imagine it looks beautiful on a sunny day.",
          "Would be nice if there was more information provided regarding the history of the building, but the location is a great place to start your day.",
          "An interesting building front in Altstadt Innsbruck. There isn't a significant amount to do at the Golden Roof itself -- just look and take pictures. It is very scenic, as is the entire Main Street through old town Innsbruck. There are countless little shops, cafes, and",
          "A small museum in the centre of the Old Town with Austrian and Jewish history. There is a huge Torah on display. Amazing. Great place to visit on a rainy day which happened to me. Fascinating 'window with golden roof'. There is a great view of the main street from the window of",
          "The Golden Roof itself doesn't offer a whole lot of entertainment other than the museum, but this is the main town square and always has events going on in front of the Roof!",
          "Historically significant but not worth a special trip. We took the trip from Salzburg to Zurich via Innsbruck since it only added 30 minutes to our overall trip. The town was located at the base of a beautiful range of mountains and the Goldenes Dachl was easy to find. But",
          "Located in the old town in s square type area you can't miss the attraction. The golden roof apparently is mostly bronze with very little gold actually used. It has an interesting story that goes with the door. We saw it as part of a city walking tour. It is a free attraction",
          "It's fun to envision Emperor Maximilian I sitting under the Goldenes Dachl 500 years ago and enjoying the festivals on the street below. Then, turn right, walk down Hofgasse, buy some souvenirs, taste some strudel, and head to the Hofkirche.",
          "We had the pleasure seeing the golden roof in the rain and in the sunshine. It was good to see the contrast of the daylight colours on it. The wet weather sent a lot of tourists away and the Euro Austria was playing against Hungary so it was very empty with tourists and had",
          "It just an ordinary balcony but with special features of golden roof. Being said that this balcony used to be an observing location for the emperor and his wife in past. Maybe this is the only balcony with pure golden roof. Taking picture from far away is enough and wiki the",
          "Recently we stayed in Old Town Innsbruck, not far from the Golden Roof. It's an interesting place to see but I certainly wouldn't travel a great distance just to see it.",
          "The Golden Roof is at the end of a large pedestrian area so it is a good place to meet up. It is very hard to miss as the sun glints off the gold tiles. Lots of street performers and resturants in the square nearby. A very nice setting to spend some time in the city",
          "I'm sure I should have been more impressed but we've seen so many amazing things that just wasn't anything great",
          "Was an authentic Austrian experience. The area is very touristy but I still got some quality bargains!",
          "Where this building is located there are a lot of very nice shops and things to look at. The street is fantastic and it is worth walking to look at it and whilst doing so, see some of the shops and atmosphere of the town.",
          "Take a picture in the old Town Pedestrian old street, shops, restaurants, very nice Close to the Cathedral, to the river",
          "Beautiful building and nice surrounding atmosphere. Try to visit in early morning to avoid crowded. Shopping along this narrow street is fun as well",
          "I bought a Museummobilcard when I was staying at Innsbruck. This is a bargain if you head up to the mountains on a terrific set of rides and then see maybe one or two museums - so I decided to see what the Goldenes Dachl had to offer, other than its sparkly golden roof (which",
          "Nice to visit the whole surrounding area. Check out any events near the place. we saw 2 events here on 3 days. Check with the tourist office nearby or on the net.",
          "This is in the most old world part of Innsbruck. The area was just around the corner from our Hotel Innsbruck and it felt like stepping back in time as the square is surrounded by old architecture. The entrance to the museum attracted my wife to stand and take a photo. That's",
          "The view is nice but it's not something I would go to innsbruck for just to see the golden roof.. the museum was ok. But nog about the historie of the golden roof..",
          "Another Icon of this city, we are always early to rise to see icons like these in any different cities we've been to avoid tourists or groups by buses before they arrive we're done and took different angles of photos, an extremely extraordinary kind of architecture made of pure",
          "nice and shiny these days- a good start to a stroll along the main streets, with street theatre, cafes , shops and views",
          "Must take a photo as you pass by. Lots of tourist posing for pics in front which makes it hard to get a good pic, go early or late before the tour groups arrive. The museum cost \u20ac4.80 which is free if you have the Innsbruck card.",
          "This site is easily visible in the hotel / shopping area of Innsbruck. We saw a wedding taking place beneath it.",
          "Since I read up on this prior to our trip, I was really looking forward to seeing it in person. I accidentally happened upon it when I emerged from one of the streets after getting lost on our way from the Nordkette. Since it had just drizzled, the roof was shining. It's so",
          "I like the cosy atmosphere, service good, food traditional, right in the centre of the old town. On a busy night you may be asked to share a table, which should add to the experience.",
          "We visited this several times as it is in the center of Old Town. It was explained thoroughly on our walking tour and afterwards we visited the Golden Roof Museum. This was well worth visiting and admission included with the Innsbruck Card.",
          "It is what it is.. just a gold roof, and not even a proper roof, but their was plenty of things happening in the same area so what that bad in the end.",
          "Although it was under construction, you could see the beauty of the roof. It is in the main square which is nice as well.",
          "This is a lovely city and the golden roof is no more special than so many other sights, get off the main streets and wander. Too many people just seeing one or two sites. Better to explore them and the back streets",
          "\u20ac4 to get in and is only one floor of a small building, most of the pieces are about maximillion , but quite informative. For \u20ac 4 it's worth a look.",
          "Amazing to hear the story behind the Goldenes Dachl. You must get inside the Museum too. Free to look at from the Old Town Square. It is in a quaint street with pretty shops , caf\u00e9s and restaurants. Very vibrant and we felt safe to walk around hunting for good souvenirs.",
          "If you are passing through Innsbruck, it's nice to see the Golden Roof, but it's not worth a trip to Innsbruck just to see it. If the sun isn't shining on it, it's nothing special--it looks much nicer when the sun is shining on it. There are lots of shops and cafes in the",
          "The street is very famous as you may find many restuarnt and shops nearby, but Golden roof as not so special.",
          "As one o the main attraction it could be full of tourist flocking trying to take pictures at same time",
          "Lovely to see - but don't go in unless you are really keen on history - or have an Innsbruck card when it's worth a free look. Not that much in there.",
          "The golden roof is the place were tourists meet in Innsbruck. So, you can't miss it. But even more interesting as the (small) golden roof are the wall paintings and the architecture of the historic buildings around it.",

          "The golden roof wasn't anything special. Then again I haven't really read into it and I know nothing about it. The good thing was that there was always a party going on underneath The Golden Roof. Restraunts and vendors lined the street in front of it. It was very crowded but",
          "Well, it's just a building with a guilded tile roof, but it gives you an idea how it must have felt like to be standing on the balcony surrounded by the incredibly useless yet impressive opulence. \"Yawn, look at the filthy commons\".",
          "This is the photo every tourist wants to take in Innsbruck. We utilised our Innsbruck Card and went to the museum for free where you get to see the roof from inside. The rest of the museum was fine and despite the audio guide we quickly skipped through the displays and hearing",
          "This is only a building with roof coloured golden. Has some good drawings and idols on balcony. This is historical building with good architectural work. We have not entered to see museum. You can visit it if time permits.",
          "The building itself is a nice piece of architecture, located in the old part of Innsbruck. Roof tiles are coloured with gold, that's it. They say that one of the roof tiles is made of pure gold; I don't know whether this is true, although it seems hard to believe. You can't miss",
          "beautiful place in the heart of Innsbruck, you also have a view on the great architecture of the city and on the mountains",
          "What a great sight to see. And a great museum with audio guide with all the information you have to know about the golden roof. I would recommend you to take the tour as a history is important, it's not just a shiny roof.",
          "One of the most known landmarks in Innsbruck, but honestly it is absolutely nothing special. As it is located in the city center, you will probably pass through it anyway. Take a picture and move forward to the Hofburg.",

          "This is one of the least appealing attractions in Innsbruck. There are lots of stairs to climb inside, and the museum doesn't have much of interest beside old black and white photos of the Nazi occupation in Austria. The man at the ticket desk on 4/19/16 was so absorbed by his",
          "It's just a golden roof which everyone says you have got to see when you go to Innsbruck, but my husband and I went there, not knowing the significance of it. Well, it's just something different! Quite a distance from the train station though, so you would have to walk a bit!",
          "Not much to see or do here. The golden roof is something you'll want to see in Innsbruck but it won't take more than 5 minutes of your trip.",
          "It looked a bit odd to see a golden roof in the center of the city, where all others are build in a different architecture style. But i enjoyed taking pictures of it since it is very well known with locals, but unfortunately i didn't had the time to hear the history of it.",
          "Nothing special about that roof :) It's golden by looks like any other goldish metal. It's easy to overlook this attraction.",
          "Just cross the street from city center and you'll see the Golden Roof, tourists were taking pictures so we noticed it.Reading the history behind it however made us appreciate it more. Plenty of souvenir shops and restaurants in the vicinity."

        "wiki": "The Bergisel Ski Jump (German: Bergiselschanze), whose stadium has a capacity of 26,000, is a ski jumping hill located in Bergisel in Innsbruck, Austria. It is one of the more important venues in the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup, annually hosting the third competition of the prestigious Four Hills Tournament.\nIts first competitions were held in the 1920s using simple wood constructions. The larger hill was first built in 1930 and was rebuilt before the 1964 Winter Olympics for the individual large hill event. Twelve years later, the venue hosted the same event. The hill in its current form was finished in 2003 and was designed by the British Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ski jumping hills\nhttp://www.stampsoftheworld.co.uk/wiki/Austria_2013_Modern_Architecture for a 2013 stamp\n\n\n== References ==\n\n1964 Winter Olympics official report. p. 112.

          "While it may be a bit of a walk to get there, the Bergisel Ski Jump is very interesting. Once in the arena, you can get the cable car to the top, view the jump from an athletes position, and even have a coffee and the special Bergisel Torte (shaped like the ski jump). Its a",
          "This ski jump can be seen from almost every corner of Innsbruck. It can be reached by a comfortable bus journey and both the bus and the entrance ticket are included in the Innsbruck Card (highly recommended). The trampoline was inaugurated in 1930 for the Olympic Winter Games",
          "We could see the Bergisel ski jump tower from our hotel framed through the Triumphpforte so we figured we'd go and check it out, our knowledge being limited to the Winter Olympics held here in the 70s. We were so pleased that we did, it was a huge highlight of our stay in",
          "We went there to experience a good view of Innsbruck and to see the place after watching the jumpers at the Olympics on tv. Very impressive! We combined the visit with a trip to the museum with the Tyrolean Panorama nearby and found out a lot about the history of Tyrol. The",
          "Wow this is a must do!! We were lucky enough to watch two brilliant jumpers perform approx 5 jumps each in the time we were there. You can watch from the bottom or head to to top too see the amazing views of Innsbruck. Well worth it!!",
          "what a great experience, at the top of the jump the views over the city are stunning, but the tower itself is incredible, easy access via a cable car, unmissable if visiting Innsbruck.",
          "Wife and I wanted to go see this as we could clearly see it from our hotel room. So we decided to head up one morning to try and catch a practice session. Were we luck to catch a few jumps in the morning session. It truly is something amazing to watch. We watched from the",
          "An absolute MUST SEE if you are in Innsbruck. We spent about 3 hours here and even got to see someone actually jumping! Amazing facility, updated in 2003 and still hosts various events each year. Easy to find, car parking on site (chargeable), cafe at top but I would",
          "From someone who doesn\u2019t come across ski jumps everyday this was a true experience. You see them on TV but it\u2019s not until you stand along side of one or go to the top of one & look down that you truly get a sense of scale. We while there got a chance to watch some guys",
          "This is an interesting place to visit. There is a lovely garden close by and the Tyrolean Panorama so you can see a few things an the same visit. Three ski jumpers were practicing on the day that we went there and it was very intersesting to see them. They spray the jump with",
          "This is a wonderful place to see as it's a part of our Olympic history. At first this wasn't on our list of places to visit in Innsbruck but after getting the Innsbruck card for a second time we finally went and were we ever glad we did. There's a small ride to get to the top",
          "This place has had several winter olympics. The cable car goes up a bit. Its excellent for the views. If you fear going up a mountain go up here first its real easy and pleasurable.",
          "Great views over Innsbruck from the top and a good restaurant where you can also enjoy the views. The viewing platform is enclosed by glass. You may also see people practicing jumping even in summer as we did. Get the TS bus to the Panorama and then it's a short walk to the",
          "We rode to the top And had lunch at the restaurant. The food was very good but I would recommend going and only having dessert which would be more affordable and their desserts are fabulous. Really enjoyed the views all the way around and the experience. Ask at the ticket office",
          "Worth it just for the view. Although we visited out of snow season, we saw jumpers practicing and landing on the artificial surface. Stunning.",
          "Got a family ticket and spent an hour and half looking around, probably one of the cheapest things to do in Innsbruck and well worth a visit, the walk up to the top is not so bad!!",
          "Seeing the venue was full of unexpected surprises. For example, there is a bronze plaque showing the medal winners from the 1976 Olympics. The highlight though was watching two people practice their ski jumps.",
          "After I have read all the reviews about this place I came with high expectations. The parking space for the attraction costs 2.60Euros per hour and it is quite far from the Bergisel. The place needs already to be refurbished as it does not look good and it is hard to walk on the",
          "The 50m high ski jump tower. When I come here there is jump show. It\u2019s quite amazing. To get better view when there is ski jump show, just take place at the Sky Restaurant. Ticket price is \u20ac9.50 for adults but it will be free with Innsbruck card.",
          "We heard this is a great place to visit, and we weren't disappointed. I've wondered what it would be like to be at the top of one of these ski jumps. Absolutely terrifying. The views from the top were great, and the funicular ride up to the top was interesting. It gave me a",

          "To go up the Bergisel ski jump you have to take the funicular which is quite expensive for a family. Though the view from the tower is exciting, I cannot really recommend this excursion because the food and service in the restaurant are not very good. Starting at the parking",

          "If you are staying in Innsbruck take a walk to visit the ski jump. It certainly makes you appreciate the sport. It looked a little run down as it wasn\u2019t covered in fresh snow. The lift wasn\u2019t operating so we couldn\u2019t head to the top and it was the end of the day so we weren\u2019t",
          "This brings home how amazing those ski-jumpers are, you get vertigo just standing up there let alone thinking of jumping. the best bit though is that while contemplating their next move these guys look down on the distant landing spot and just after that a full-on cemetary!",
          "Very impressive and not too expensive. Very nice cake and coffee at top level restaurant. Great views over ski jump.",
          "The Bergisel Ski Jump is breathtaking. Take a trip to the top and imagine what it must be like to launch yourself off a ski-jump when all you can see beneath you is a cemetery! The restaurant provides a great view of Innsbruck. Highly recommended.",
          "walked up to the venue which is highly impressive with lovely views of the city. Id love to go and see the actual jumping but find it difficult to find any information on times",
          "This is our third visit. It over great views of the ski jump, but it also has some great views over the city. Very cost effective and when we went 3inches of snow had just fallen. Cafe on 2nd floor is not too pricey either.",
          "Being a skier I've never understood ski jumping & yet I always watch it. Madness-Totally. It is an incredible sight, let alone to be in this Olympic Stadium. One point: What did the ski jumpers think @ the top of the jump when they looked down & saw a cemertary @ the bottom!!",
          "Nice breakfast. Best thing is view. Can walk there from centre. Interesting place if you have a couple of hours.",
          "Absolutely loved Bergisel. Being able to go up the ski jump and actually stand at the top of the run is amazing, you can also enjoy a drink or food at the cafe at the top. The views are stunning from the stadium as well. The one thing I was really disappointed about was I",
          "haha .. well, when you see ski jumping on tv it looks high but then you see it for real and you realize what it takes! Nice visit .. with cable car to the side to take you up. Some small history pieces but really it is the views .. at bottom looking up .. and at top looking",
          "Highlight of our trip. The views are amazing and the history too. When you stand st the bottom, you cannot believe anyone would jump from that height! You get the lift up and can imagine the anticipation of those who have jumped from this amazing platform. Great restaurant and",
          "The view from above is amazing. For breakfast with a view its recommended. The fun part is imagining how can someone jump from this hight and land skiing. Well..",
          "Best to go on a clear day as the views are stunning. Worth buying the ticket to go into the jump. The info boards are interesting to read and the panorama view of Innsbruck are impressive.",
          "We visited Innsbruck in July. Since we bought the 24-hour Innsbruck Card for 39 EUR and had rented a car for our road trip in Austria, we tried to do as many attractions as possible. This was by far our favourite attraction in Innsbruck. The Bergisel Ski Jump is located 4 km",
          "We bought a 48 hour Innsbruck pass which covers the \u20ac9.50 entrance cost for this attraction. Amazing to see the Olympic ski jump area and see how high the athletes jump from! There is a restaurant overlooking the ski jump with panoramic views of the mountains and the city of",
          "Incredible to see the ski jump! Lovely lunch with wonderful views of the city. Well worth a visit for a few houra",
          "This place has a very impressive view. We tried twice to get in. The first day we got there at 5pm only to be told that 4.30 is last admission. The second day we made it in with intention of eating in the restaurant but had a look around First and went to order food at 4.15 only",

          "Fantastic day out at the Four Hills Tournament in spite of the pouring rain! Singing, Mexican waves- everybody in good mood! Ski-jumpers amazing greeted with big cheers or sighs of disappointment. Could hear pin drop when Richard Freitag fell. Toilet facilities dire (portaloos",
          "We walked to the ski jump which is really accessible and very visible from the city centre. There are a number of nice little sightseeing opportunities on the way up to the ski jump so the walk is very pleasant. Once up there you can go to the top in the lift you can really",
          "Very excited to find I could visit a Ski Jump! Easily accessible from the sightseeing bus drop-off at Bergisel. You can walk around freely and take interesting photos. Once you reach the top via the tram you get great views over Innsbruck and the valley in general. You can also",
          "Visited the site with my daughter and was so impressed we returned to watch the qualifying rounds of the 4 hills tournament which was a real eye opener. Be aware that on competition days you can\u2019t park at the main car park. We parked on a railway bridge near the church at the",
          "A good way to spend half an hour (or longer if you want to stop of lunch!). Great location to stop at if you are going up to the Panorama museum, it\u2019s just a couple of minutes walk up the road. Access to the jump is easy via a lift and then take the elevator up to the terrace to",
          "Interesting place to see. Especially if you don\u2019t live close to the mountains and have ski jumping area. In the beginning of January there is also a competition to that place so woul be great to see the jumpers. Building itself is interesting and on top of it you can see the",
          "So we bought the Innsbruck card and took full advantage of what it had to offer including the ski jump. We watched the jumpers from every possible vantage point and were awe struck. Try the back deck at the coffee shop right behind the start for a unique perspective .",
          "Wonderful to visit this place and see first hand how steep the ski jump is...TV makes it look easy but...um no way you would get me doing that! restaurant at top is expensive and limited window seats. still worth going to see and then visit the museum next door.",
          "It os a place where winter olympics are held. One of a kind experience. You can kind players practising sli jump. There is a cafe at the top where you enjoy view of the city bit little expensive. It is free to visit this place with innsburck card. Awesome place to be. Not to be",

          "This is one of the greatest ski jump stadia, but I went there as a fan of Zaha Hadid, and was disappointed as her style does not really materialize. There is a nice coffee/restaurant at the top, and a souvenir store at the bottom. Probably, what I enjoyed the most was the",
          "Its almost impossible to miss the The ski jump at Bergisel with its distintive architecture by Zaha Hadid. And seeing it up close only added to the experience. There's a nice cafe at the top. Even outside of the skiing season you might see someone jump (and thats impressive in",
          "Fabulous views of the Innsbruck area, but disappointed we couldn\u2019t access the viewing platform for the ski jump.",
          "Interesting attraction in our Austria travels. It\u2019s something you can see from far away but to get to the actual location is not easy to drive to. We had just missed the practice time and found out there is a charge to go in. With family that is big into winter sports, it was",
          "Well worth stopping by and travailing up to the top. We arrived around 9am from the hotel, it is a shame it was not advertised you can get breakfast at the top with a view. We would have made the effort if know. If you can get up early for it I would say head up for it. with a",
          "The Ski Jump has a great view and a nice restaurant on top, in the grounds there is the Regimental Museum of Kaiser Franz Joseph\u00b4s Mountain Troops and the local Museum of the Bergisel complete with Panorama painting of a huge Battle for Innsbruck during the Napoleonic War. Well",
          "I haven\u2019t been at this ski jump since I was on a ski trip when at school, a considerable number of years ago. Yes, it is a bit dilapidated now, but fond memories came flooding back. It is good to know it is used regularly for concerts and other gatherings. A pity we couldn\u2019t",
          "I love all sport and the olympics so this was a great chance to see the view from where the sportspeople start their jump! Great fun visit",
          "We visited the Ski Jump on a recent trip to Innsbruck. We enjoyed this experience to view up close a part of Olympic history, the coffee shop at the top of the ski jump was great and sitting there having coffee and cake, you could gaze out at a spectacular view.",
          "Bergisel Ski Jumping Stadium was an impressive attraction steeped in history. In 1988, Pope John Paul II celebrated a mass before some 60,000 people. As one of the venues for the Olympic Winter Games held in Innsbruck in both 1964 and 1976, It even now continues to enjoy",
          "If you thought ski jumpers were mad this will confirm it! Seriously, a must see structure if your visiting Innsbruck -included in the Innsbruck Card so you can get there on the Sightseer bus.",
          "Great to be able to visit such an iconic symbol of Innsbruck and the 2 Olympic games held here. The cafe at the top sells mouth watering Sachertorte. The views down the ski slope are breath taking and the thought of jumping stomach churning! Views over the city and Brenner Pass",
          "Nice destination for innsbruck, interesting and impressive. I even saw skiers training in the summer",
          "Visiting this mammoth ski jump is well worth the time. The ski jump itself is very impressive and far more massive than it feels when watching the Olympics on tv. But the views are also absolutely amazing of Salzburg. It's hard to imagine how ski jumpers aren't distracted by",
          "It is amazing at the vertical drop that ski jumpers actually make. You watch the distance on tv, but from standing at the bottom you think they drop farther down than they fly out. There is a restaurant at the top where you can watch the planes come down the valley below you",
          "Legendary place and well known from tv. Hard to go, for exsample tram, you have to walk up long time. Thats why i drive my own car straight to the gate. I will return this arena in january 2018, when the tickets are coming to sale.",
          "Wonderful to see the height of the ski jump - cannot believe anyone would dare to jump from there. Access very good for all abilities. Coffee shop",
          "For me it took ages to get there with lots of walking. It was ok to see but wasn't that spectacular. Could of made more out of it. Restaurant on top which was ok.",
          "I always look down this as a visitor and am amazed that a skier would have the nerve to launch himself/herself down this slope, much less jump at the end! From the top it appears that one would sail straight into the middle of a street in the city center. far from the truth, of",
          "It's a ski jump. It looks like one and isn't much. But it does have a great view over toward the city and the mountains.",
          "On the 9th August 2017 we visited the ski jumping area expecting to get a flavour of what the jumpers would feel like flying through the air. What was not expected was that it would be used by actual jumpers, many of them young lads. It was an amazing experience and worth every",
          "My son and I loved this experience, it gives a real feeling of how how the jump is, you do not get that on TV! We saw a person do the jump - he was training I think as its summer or just likes the audience, but it added to the experience",
          "We were lucky to see someone jump just after we arrived at the Bergisel ski jump on our recent visit. It's quite amazing. So try and time your visit to see this. The ski jump is included in the Innsbruck Card, which is better value for money. It means you can also visit the",
          "You get a great view of the ski jump and tower from the bottom and there are some great views of Innsbruck and also a small photographic exhibition. Then there is a quirky funicular (almost like a lift) which runs up beside the jump (so you get good views). At the top is a",
          "Coming from a plains state, we were fascinated by this! We went in for free with our Innsbruck card and made sure to go during the hours there was practice jumping occurring. We got to see a jump from the bottom and then rode up with the jumper. We learned that they train year",
          "Just popped by on the hop on hop off city bus. Watched some people ski jumping on the dry jump. TV doesn't do it justice. I can only imagine a fully packed venue in the winter.",
          "We were in the area so we paid a visit. It was quite a find. Really impressive to see the jump. It put it in perspective for those sportsmen who jump from those. What a skill. Great picture of Eddie the Eagle.",
          "take the opportunity to have a good breakfast almost in the clouds. You have a nice few over the city. You also should visit the museum that shows a littlebit of history of Innsbruck",
          "Another great place to visit and then ask yourself would you dare to jump from the top. You might even be lucky and see sportmen actually practicing on the jump, even in the summer.",
          "Great view over Innsbruck and watched a few teenagers doing this jump. Not for the faint hearted - one of them was only 15 and was brilliant on the jump - well impressed!",
          "If you come from a non alpine country but have seen ski jumping, this venue is hugely interesting to visit when there is no snow. You get the sense of how imposing the jump is and see the amphitheatre around the landing area, it has very much peaked my interest in watching the",
          "An excellent trip. Amazing to see the venue and also watch ski jumpers...in the summer. Make sure you go there on a still as the \"eagles\" don't do wind! Did not use restaurant but it looked very nice.",
          "Even though you can see this structure from locations all over the city, it is only by seeing it close up that you can appreciate its full scale - we were lucky enough to catch a ski jump, though i dont think they are very regular, as we only saw the one. Felt a bit queazy from",
          "I would have like more time here to see this jump from above but alas could only look at it as we drove past. It is very impressive.",
          "This is something you have got to do if in this location. It is simply a stunning site, more so if you can witness the guys actually jumping. They do it in summer as well surprise surprise ! I`m of the opinion that these guys are extremely brave or extremely stupid - yet to",
          "Yes... fun tour made especially interesting as they were practicing that day. We took the small lift up and enjoyed watching them from different views...",
          "We visited with RIVIERA TRAVEL, but it's worth noting that we didn't go inside. Tour coach went around the car park. Separately, during my spare time, I could see the Ski Jump from the Westbahnhof platform. No snow as I visited during a summer heatwave.",
          "Bergisel has seen two Winter Olympic Games. Fantastic futuristic design with a magnificent view over the city of Innsbruck. If you're fit you can climb the 455 steps from the cable car access point...if you're less so...then take the brief funicular to a specatular viewing",
          "I visited the ski jump one spring evening with a conference group. Set in a great position above the city. Its a bit of a short but steep walk up but well worth it. Started with an introductory talk from a ski jumper (apparently in the summer they do demo jumps onto the",

          "It was late in the afternoon in Innsbruck and we decided to make the trek from the Olde Towne across town to the Bergisel. It was a about a 30 minute walk thru a variety of neighborhoods (all safe). We arrived there during the last hour and we were very pleases that we decided",

          "Easy to reach from the city centre on Tram number 1 and then a pleasant but serious climb up the pedestrian pathway. About 20 storeys according to the Fitbit. And so worth it! Then ride the funicular inside Bergisel and take the lift up the tower. You can have coffee and cake in",
          "YOU MUST GO!!! Even if you have no interest in ski jumping you will be amazed at the architecture of the landmark and the stunning views of the mountains. The restaurant at the top of the jump is average, but fantastic for views of Innsbruck. Also a very enjoyable walk through",

          "It is a must do experience and the views are spectacular from the top. The menu of restaurant looks good but only had a beer with a view. If you like walking it is great to walk done to cable car station. Worth while experience",
          "An amazing ski jumping arena that lets you appreciate just how nuts the sport is. They hide away the view point of the actual ski jump, where you can look down at what the jumpers see, its crazy, so i didnt even realise you could do this until i got all the way back down to the",
          "On a day trip from Obsteig walked through the old town to the ski jump - up the slope and then paid for the lift to the top. Great view of the jump from the top floor and from the rear door at the side of the restaurant there was a view of the jump start slope leading down main",

          "Take the no 1 tram from the centre of Innsbruck and walk up the slope - it's well worth it. 8 Euros each for the lift up and then you can stand at the top of the 'in run' - it's a lot steeper than it looks on the TV. Very nice cafe with a spectacular view over Innsbruck.",
          "Worth a visit for the views alone. The day I visited the lift was broken but they provided altermate transportation up and reduced the entrance price, which was nice. It was fascinating to see up close and imagine what it must be like to zip down that hill. And again, the",

          "This was our second visit and it is still as exciting as ever. Great to see someone training on the hill as it made it appear even steeper. Even if you are not a keen sportsperson it is worth the visit just to see Innsbruck from above. If you are a member of the Austrian Alpine",

          "I decided to come here as part of my Innsbruck pass, and because it stands so defiantly over the whole city. I was definitely not disappointed. Access was good because I came by car but did have to pay for parking. On arrival I was lucky to witness someone jumping even though",
          "Visited around 2pm. No tour buses and not to busy. Amazing views from all aspects of the sight and both young kids loved it. We had lunch in the restaurant which was fantastic (a little pricey but worth it). Toilets up the top of the tower are clean and free to use. We used the",
          "We went because of the architect but left amazed as we were fortunate to see some ski jumpers, absolutely amazing! The view from the top is pretty good too, there is a viewing platform and a coffee shop grab a coffee and take in the view",
          "We visited Bergisel and took the cable car then lift up to where the skiers jump from. It looks high on TV and landings mostly look graceful. When you see the height, angle of the track and the landing they must need b*lls of steel.",
          "We stopped by in our own car - my husband loved going up the windy road ! We'd seen the movie Eddie the Eagle on the flight over and enjoyed seeing the ski jump in real life",
          "When in Innsbruck this is a must the view is amazing, and this time there was a young man doing the jump worth a look.",
          "Enjoy it today - there was actually someone training there - taken some nice photo's - little restaurant at the top , also charging top prices , but the view you get from there is magnificent !!",
          "This ski jump is included in the Innsbruck card so we thought we should check it out even though it was mid summer. We are so glad we went! The set up was like nothing we'd seen before and we could either trudge up the many steps or catch a funicular to the top. From the top",
          "Worth your time to go up to the top. You can walk or take the easy way and ride up. The view is wonderful and when you look back down the jump you understand that ski jumping is not a weekend sport that one just decided to do for fun.",
          "Get on a 'Hop on and Hop off' bus to get there. It is worth a visit to admire the amazing work and facilities which were available at the Ski Olympics Resort in 1964 & 1976. There is a small cable lift which takes you to the tower. There is a restaurant and observatory at the",
          "Make sure to check what time it was open if you wish to enter the building. When we arrived the gate is close so we only can see the ramp from the outside. It built for the winter olympic once held in Innsbruck and said to be the highest sky jump ramp. Nothing so special with",
          "Without coming down the ski run to see the view the ski jumpers have, I was surprised to see how small the landing area was. Fantastic views over the city from here. Nice modern structure.",
          "Seeing Bergisel in person was a treat. Ride the tram to top and the views of Innsbruck are fabulous. No need to ride Nordetrren Cable Car as the jump has the same views. Walk down through the stairwells to mid level to see all the famous jumpers pictures. Summertime jumpers",
          "Came here as it was part of our Innsbruck card and we are both interested in skiing. Glad we did. There was a skier demonstrating ski jumping so we watched him jump three times. just amazing. Only a small area but interesting to see and to be able to look at just how high",
          "Not being a ski freak, I wasn't going to go down the ramp. To see how long and high it is is one thing, going down is another.",
          "It's a neat place to visit. The views alone are amazing! I've been here twice and thoroughly enjoyed it! You can see the entire city:)",
          "This famous ski jump has a restaurant at the top, good for breakfast or light snack. There is a breathtaking view of Innsbruck, the Inn valley and the Nordkette mountain. Easy to get to using public transportation or or use the hop on/city tour bus where entrance tickets are",
          "This famous ski jump was used in the 1964 & 1976 Winter Olympics and can be seen 250m up on the hill from all around town. There\u2019s a quaint little incline elevator to take you up to the tower. Inside the tower is a restaurant and a viewing deck. To see down the take-off track",
          "The views are good from the top. It was the first place we visited in Innsbruck so it was fun. Of course the main highlight of trip was the hafelekar trip but bergisel was a nice addition.",
          "Rode the city tour bus up to the bergisl and got tickets into the ski jump (all included in the city pass). No snow but it's only when you get up close you realise how steep and high this thing is. You really don't appreciate how severe this thing is from tv. Restaurant and",
          "If you have the Innsbruck Card, take the HOHO bus to the Panorama stop. The funicular to the Bergisel Ski Jump is up some stairs and a walk up a hill from that bus stop. On the afternoon I visited the ski jump, I counted 5 adults and 3 toddlers about twenty times to make sure",
          "I walked to here from Innsbruck centre here I was staying. Lovley walk.I walked up the steps to the top and the views are fantastic just like all this lovely country.Well recommended,I bought some souvenirs from the shop there and a lovely cool drink too;",
          "Beautiful view from up there : you can see Innsbruck in its entirety. To get up there, you can either climb the flights of steps or take the funicular. Once up, you will be able to see the trampoline used by skiers during the Olympics. Overall, I recommend this activity for",
          "Very interesting place to see. My mom and I went to the restaurant but she had a coffee and I had a drink. Great view of the city. Great attraction.",
          "A great view from the top and very interesting seeing the ski jump. There wasn't much else to see though but it was pretty good.",
          "The Ski-Jump building is very striking and the panorama terrace and cafe are nice. The terrace was quite windy. The departure area used by the Ski-Jumpers isn't open to the public to see. There is a small souvenir shop. To get there it's an uphill walk from the Tram stop in",
          "The views are seriously spectacular. You can see the view that faces skiers who may be taking a jump and all around the other sides too. Tremendous view over the city and surrounding countryside. We travelled up from Innsbruck via tram and walked the last part which was quite",
          "Great to see and it is a lot larger once you get up close! The restaurant was great too, a bit pricey but lovely food and worth it for the views of the city.",
          "This ski jump is situated on a hill overlooking Innsbruck town center and the surrounding areas. After walking up to the entrance area you can access the ski jump for 10 EUR (discounts for students / large groups / or if you can negotiate with the ticket man ;). The entry price",
          "The ski jump entrance is via a long walk through a park, which is up hill. Once you've made the treck and get your breath back, you pay an admission fee of around 10 euros and a tram car takes you up to the jump tower and then a lift to the top. The view is amazing and makes you",
          "We did not pay to go in to Bergisel, but there is an excellent panoramic walk around the site which has great views.",
          "Pure magic...amazing to watch the entire city erupt in fireworks ( even up on top the ski hills...google it to see the amazing spectacle). My dad represented Canada at the 1965 Olympics and stood at the base of this ski jump stadium during the opening and closing ceremonies.",
          "To the ski jump base you can go by car. An elevator is going to the top where is the starting point for ski jumpers but the nice panoramic restaurant, too. Quite good food but no any excellence like in a premium restaurant. The view over city is excellent. Nice and unique",
          "The importance of ski jumping in Innsbruck's history and the various competitions held here will interest any ski or sports enthusiast.",
          "We made a pit stop here when we were on vacation. It was in September so there was no snow. I might consider going back to watch them actually jump but without the snow it was very boring. Nice little town though.",
          "The Bergisel Ski Jump is a striking feature on the Innsbruck skyline, close up it's even more impressive. Visiting provides an even greater appreciation of the jumps shear scale and the bravery of the competitors. The top of the tower also provides some nice views of the city.",
          "We went up on the bus and although it looks very impressive, you can see it from m the town quite easily without having to make the effort to get up there",
          "I went to see this along with the Tirol Panorama. The views over the city are good and I bet it is great to see the jump in action which, sadly, I did not. As part of the Innsbruck Card, with the travel there included ( i walked back to town but worth getting the bus there) it",
          "If you've never seen a ski jump in person, it's worth a look. Viewing a ski-jump is an amazing, humbling experience that gives you a little perspective on the hard-work that goes into the sport.",
          "So cool to be at the site of the two Olympics. Head up to the top, with your Innsbruck Card, as the view back to the City and mountains is just beautiful. There is also a restaurant there with a limited but nice menu or just drop by for a drink or coffee and enjoy the view!!!!",
          "If you have ever watched ski jumping on the TV its not as scary when you have real perspective. Very brave people who do this event. A great restaurant bar at the top.",
          "Watching ski jumping on t.v. doesn't prepare you for what the jump itself looks like in person. It's definitely awe-inspiring.",
          "If you have never seen a ski Jump in real life then your really should see The Bergisel. Perched above the city you get a sense of scale which the TV can never bring. we were lucky to see some jumpers when we were there which made it more thrilling.",
          "Very good view of Innsbruck. I also liked the restaurant a lot. One day I might get my breakfast there. Also the prices are good. Looking down from the jumping side is breath taking.",
          "Quite a challenging walk to get to, and included in the Innsbruck card, the views are worth the climb. The cafe is good, too!",
          "The best part about it was the view. And the coolest part was that the Olympics we're hosted there! The restaurant was good to and had a little gingerbread house in it!",
          "We have offten watch the Ski jumping from Innsbruck on the TV, but to able to visit the actual location was a real eye opener. It brought home the realization of how really steep the jump is and what dangerous sport it really is. We were very fortunate in being there when",
          "simply amazing. From the top you have a 360 degree view of the city of Innsbruck and the surrounding mountains. There is also a small restaurant where you can have a little snack.",
          "the lift was out of action when we visited so we were admitted 1/2 price and climbed the 400 step to the bottom of the ski jump, well worth the effort, stopping for views over the city. The views from the look out point were spectacular. The restaurant was very good too, great",
          "We got the 1-day Innsbruck card as it is cheaper than going up the funicular and Nordkettenbahnen and includes free entry to nearly everything around town. The ski-jump was the only other thing we did and it was worth it. The #1 tram (direction Bergisel) takes you to the bottom",
          "We went to have a light brunch, the place is spectacular, you can see all the city and the great mountains. Specially Mr Matias, the waitress, very kind and available to help and explain many questions we had from the city, the Sky Jump, and many other info. The kindly acceded",
          "I remember the first time I saw the jump some thirty years ago during a competition, it was remarkable then, and stl is. Why, you have to wonder, would anyone do this?! It is a towering structure, perched on the hillside, and offers amazing views over the city. The jump and the",
          "The height of the ski jump is amazing. The seating around the jump area is huge, you can almost hear the crowds cheering for the jumpers. The ride to the top in the glass lift is great. There are awesome views from the platform and can only imagine what the jumper is thinking",
          "This attraction is very difficult to access - signage is poor and we did a walk round the outside looking for a way in- it was a 3 mile hike on forest trails ( actually i would recommend this as it was very good walk but we were fortunate to be wearing hiking boots). The view",
          "Well worth the trek to the top--- you can see for miles and miles, and you get a great sense of what it is like to be a ski-jumper (not for me, thanks). And the cafe offers good food, coffee, drinks and the like in a \"sealed\" environment-- you can see out fine but can't fall",
          "The athletes who dare to go down this jump must be very brave. From the bottom it doesn't look so big, but from the top you can see just how steep it is and of course at the end of the course you can see a massive graveyard so that reminds them to take care. Good to see the",
          "in the television it looks like the athlethes jumps into the cemetery. in the jumpingstadium is e great atmosphere and e crazy sound when the jumper touch the ground.",
          "Worth a trip just for the views. We had lunch in the restaurant whilst taking in the beautiful mountains",
          "Bergisel Ski Jump is located a 15 minitues from the city center and offer amazing view over the whole city. I would recommend zo everyone who is staying in Innsbruck for couple of days",
          "It was sunny day and the view was amazing.... Be carefull about the weather, it could be a problem. If it is rainy, you will not have any fun..",
          "I'm not a fan of winter sports but my sons wanted to go and we went, the view is fantastic and the complex, too! I enjoyed my coffee at the top, very nice!",
          "There is a cable tram that takes you to the top of the ski jump. You can spend as much time there as you want. The views of Innsbruck are so beautiful. When I looked down the jump couldn't imagine ever going down that. Those ski jumpers have nerves if steel to do that. There is",
          "This is probably one of the most famous attractions in Innsbruck. We can see it from afar, but getting close to it can be worth it. However, it is pretty far from town center and requires a car or public transit (a tourist bus goes all the way there).",
          "I went here in the evening and so was closed,but by car driver showed me from below and explained about it.It must be an thrilling sport activity .The tall build in the sky is attractive and gives spectacular view.",
          "I didn't get a chance to go up to the top but the view must be amazing. Very cool to see from down below and there are some great things to see in that area.",
          "Get an Innsbruck card - and get the hop on hop off bus to get here. It stops right outside (both are free if you have the card which you can buy from your hotel or from the tourist office) Allows you to get up close to experience what the actual ski jumpers would see as they",
          "most people could not think of anything worse than visiting a concrete ski jump. Think again. If you have any sort of imagination (like the one that you get when close to the edge of a cliff or tall building), then you ought to pay this place a visit, if just to put yourself in",
          "Parking plus admittance fee is almost 25 euros for two people. Two expensive without something astonishing to offer. The architecture is nice but from far it looks better. You can walk a bit around, you can check the view but the end you are taking pictures of a city and",
          "This was such a great place to visit. We decided to walk up the hill to where the ski jump is located. This is a very steep walk and in hindsight we would probably have taken the bus. On the other hand, the views on the way up were amazing. We headed here early in the",
          "A must see in Innsbruck Beautiful architecture, spectacular views and great history! Well worth the visit! My wife and I loved it.",
          "If Olympics makes you passionate and ski jumping interests you, then you cannot miss Bergisel. The place is steeped in the history of having hosted three previous Winter Olympics. As you climb up to the top, even without snow, you can see jumpers practising on the moistured",
          "Climbed up to the ski jump point in a lift Nice view of the ski slop form the top as alos from eth surrounding platform.",
          "We walked to the Bergisel Ski Jump from the centre of Innsbruck, a lovely walk until the final hike up to the entrance. Very atmospheric and whilst there we saw the jumpers training. Very much to be part of the itinery on the visit to Innsbruck",
          "The view was beautiful and makes you appreciate ski jumpers that much more for being willing to ski down such a steeply sloped hill. There's a cafe at the top and it's a great spot for photos.",
          "This place will make you shake your head and wonder how anyone could voluntarily launch themselves at 90Kph from a concrete ramp and land on another concrete ramp. The facility alone is amazing, but we were lucky enough to visit on the day that e Austrian youth team was",
          "If you are in Innsbruck you certainly need to visit one of the olympic venues. The Bergisel jumping hill is easily reachable by bus or tram (plus a 10 minutes walk up the hill). At the foot of the ski jump you will find a lift which takes you up, followed by an elevator to get",
          "This place is good for a short 2 hour visit . Located not very far from the City center, it takes around 10 minutes by car. After parking, we just walk less than 5 minutes to the cash counter. They charge 9.50 Euros per person and while entering we will see very colourfully",
          "We went here during fall so didnt see the snow or anything. But the ride to top is somewhat exciting and the view is amazing.",
          "Bergisel Sky Panorama offers an opportunity for ascending the olimpic sky jumping track of Innsbruck. The view is great. The place is worth a visit. As to the restaurant, I must say that it offers decent dishes. We had the typical local soupe (not unforgettable)",
          "A stunning facility in itself that offer beautiful views over Innsbruck and the surrounding mountain valley. You'll leave with new appreciation of the skill and nerve required to be a ski jumper. Consider walking down from the top to fully appreciate the event!",
          "Go to the top and stand where the ski jumpers jump off from. It's super impressive. I never dreamed it was so steep. The building and the grounds are impressive also. Try to find a guide that can tell you more about the jump and the other things that are done there.",
          "Really, when you are lined up for a jump, you see a graveyard. I guess it is meant as a confidence booster. The view of Innsbruck is quite nice and worth the visit. This ski jump has been in this location for almost one hundred years. The latest renovation is beautiful. I",
          "A really unique sight in Innsbruck. The iconic Bergisel ski jump has a lift to the top where there is a viewing platform and a great restaurant. You might even be lucky enough to see people training on the jump, even in the summer.",
          "Just looking up at this historic jump makes you nervous. You can't miss it. It's in the main street!",
          "We visited after it had closed for the day, but the gate was open so we were still able to walk in and see the ski jump. The views of downtown Innsbruck from the bottom of the ski jump were breathtaking - I can only imagine what it must look like from the top! This is worth a",
          "I attended the Air & Style snowboarding event here which had an amazing vibe. It was very cold and it snowed, however I did have a VIP ticket which had indoor access and was heated. The view was great from the VIP box, only from the window up front though, if you are behind the",
          "First saw this skijump (or at least the old one on the same site)as a young girl in 1970 and the one thing I remember being told was that at the bottom of the jump was the graveyard, so on having the chance just had to see it for myself. Took the furnicular to base of the",
          "Legendary ski jump....overlooks Innsbruck and of course the graveyard that the jumpers see as they start their run. As part of the Innsbruck card (\u20ac9 otherwise) went in and was rewarded with practice ski jumps by international athletes training.... this really did bring the",
          "A couple of years ago we decided to get to the top of the Berg Isel ski jump. We found our way up there by public transport and then climbed up to the top, there we took the lift up to the cafe and therefore the top of the ski jump. It is absolutely awesome up there, totally",
          "Great outlook over the beautiful mountains on a clear day. Amazing to imagine the brave ski flyers to take this leap!!!!",
          "We did not pay the fee to go up the funicular, but none the less, spectacular feeling to be right where the Olympics took place. We took a hike to get there, but city buses and tour buses can get you there as well.",
          "Really cool to see how high and steep this is and to go up the funicular for views of Innsbruck and mountains behind but there isn't much to do there, thought there would be a museum or something. Luckily I saw a practice dry slopes ski jumper!",
          "This is a spectacular experience if you want to feel what it's like to stand at the top of an olympic ski jump There is also a cafe at the top that has breathtaking views and unique design. We used our Innsbruck card (33 euros) for the day to gain entry to this site.",
          "Visiting the ski jump was fantastic, even in summer. Skiers were training as we visited and it gave us a great insight to the sport. Views from the top of the ramp and the cafe at the top were fantastic, and we had a nice snack there.",
          "when you see it from a distance it doesn\"t look big but get up close go up to the top and look down were the ski jump they are brave if you go on a saturday you may some training as we were told i can\"t believe how they get 28,00 people on them stands worth a vist",
          "Visit to ski jump was exciting and spectacular. Had no idea of the height of these things. It would be very scary coming down the first slide. Spectacular views from top levy. Well worth the journey amend easily accessible using hop on hop off bus.",
          "This modern piece of architecture from the 1976 winter olympics stands out like a sore thumb and is so cool to visit. It can be seen from downtown Innsbruck area. It is still used today for training and competition.",
          "Can't believe how high the 90 meter jump is--it's looks like jumping off a 10 story building and get this--no chute!!! Those guys are good and NUTS!!!",
          "the Arena with a history of hosting 2 winter olympic games. this place is a sightseeing place for tourists. the Restaurant up the tower is best for a view of the city.one can also use the Telescope placed on the rooftop for a 1 euro coin fee.",
          "Now I know why I don't ski jump. View from the top is breath taking. I take my hat off to the athletes. This indeed is a must see in this beautiful city",
          "Jaw dropping experience standing at the top and looking at what confronts the jumpers. Great view of the city after fun ride up to top in cogwheel rail car",
          "Was great to visit Bergisel Ski Jump even in the summer! You get a real feel for how gutsy our skiers are!! Definitely worth a trip! The view over innsbruck is just another reason to head to the top.",
          "One of the highlights of our trip. We actually got to see a few austrian's practicing. A must in Innsbruck",
          "Nice place to look at the sport of ski jumping. We been there during summer so there was no snow but there were practice. The view on top was really nice. A bit walk uphill though, not recommend for people with problem walking uphill.",
          "Great panoramic view of Innsbruck. Different view to Nordkette, aber immer noch sch\u00f6n. Skiers train here sometimes and it is a great time to admire their jumping skills.",
          "Impressive from a distance - it can be seen from certain points in the town. I'm sure it'd be even more impressive (scary !) close up.",
          "We had the Innsbruck card and entry to this attraction was included. The views from the top are amazing (although the cemetary at the bottom is surely a bit off-putting for the ski-jumpers. A small funicular and a lift whizz you up to the top where there is a small restaurant",
          "The servers at the restaurant treated us with zero respect. The view was amazing but the food was overpriced and the service was poor. Go for the view but do not go to eat.",
          "An interesting, fun, and easy activity in Innsbruck, we enjoyed it with our two pre-teen aged kids. There is easy parking close by and enough English signage as to not be too confusing for non-German speakers. The lift that takes you to the top is fun and fast, the kids loved",
          "The walk from the centre of town was a bit difficult being uphill all the way. Unfortunately the day we went the lift up was broken so we had to walk up over 400 steps. But the view was worth it.",
          "An impressive chance to see the inner workings of a ski-jump: not that there are many secrets to be revealed. Be prepared for crowds occupying the limited space at the starting point - the location is nevertheless impressive, and if one goes at a weekend, there is always a",
          "Loved this trip. Enjoyed lunch at the restaurant looking out over Innsbruck and surroundings. Can't imagine how skiers can jump off this - very scary!",
          "We were recommended to visit by the TIC in Igls and it was well worth it. Very visual, lots of photo opportunities, loads of facts in English as well as German. You can really appreciate how utterly terrifying it must be to be a ski jumper.",
          "Well worth the time to visit. You have to admire the architecture and unique design. Like all points in Innsbruck, transportation to access is comfortable and frequent. One aspect no one has mentioned is the way that the entire ski jump is illuminated with changing colors at",
          "The elevator took us to the top of one of the finest ski jumps of the world. In the top restaurant we could enjoy good food with a small beer, and simultanously have a magnificent view over the city. The hill is a little smaller now than fifty years ago, but the view was the",
          "This was a very interesting and worthwhile visit. You need to go up to the top for the full experience. Impressive to see the scale of the arena and the degree of slope the jumpers land on ......they're nuts ! We'd now really like to go and see a live competition. It must be",
          "I didn't think I would enjoy it so much! Make sure you walk down rather than take the little fenicular and if the sprays come on, on the dry slope - Someone is about to practice! From the restaurant, at the back there is this tiny terrace where you stand right above what is the",
          "Must do. This is the place to literally feel bravery. That's what you need to jump off the table at a speed of 90km/hour. The adventurous might want to take 225 stairs to the top, all others will ride the funicular. Many signs in German and English language provide information",
          "This is a must see if you are in Innsbruck. We were lucky to see local jumpers practice and we did stay there almost two hours. There is an option to climb the stairs or take the elevator all the way up. There is lots of parking spaces nearby with reasonable prices.",
          "Atop the hillside resides the ski jump. It costs 9.50E to go up to the jump itself. Busy on a Sunday but you can take a bus up to the entrance if you don't feel like walking up the hillside. You can take a funicular from entrance and look down the jump itself before taking the",
          "We walked here from Inmsbruck centre took about 20 minutes. Walked up the hill and arrived at the finicular which took us to the top....9.50 euro. The views were great and the ski slope was quite scary...hats off to the people who use it....i would'nt dare!!! Got some fab",
          "You just don't realize how high these things are till you go up to the top. The city views are fantastic.",
          "My husband and I went here with a tour group, and Even though I am a bit afraid of heights, It was well worth it. There is also a lovely little coffee shop at the top where you can get a hot cocoa!",
          "Amazing views over the city and incredible to think that they jumped from that height. Needless to say, not ideal for those who do not like heights!",
          "Wow! We didn't see anyone training but to see the actual jump structure was pretty amazing itself. The guys that use this are incredibly brave and have no fear! For an Australian this was something you don't see everyday.",
          "Though i could not visit this place myself but my wife went with others and she was thrilled.I think i was not that lucky.",
          "This is a must visit even if you're not a sports or skiing fan. Thankfully we had a good day weather wise when we visited so made it pleasurable to be at the top and then at the bottom watching some rising stars practising on the dry slope. The views from the top are",
          "While the Nordkettenbahnen offers great city view from north, the Bergisel Ski jump does it from the south, along with the Alps to the north. It is a pretty new facility, and therefore looks impressive in design and architecture. The high valued Innsbruck card gives free",
          "Using the Sightseeing bus, this is easy to reach, though signposting to the actual ski jump once you are there could be clearer for visitors. We visited in June. It was not crowded and was a great experience to see the jump from all angles. The staff in the restaurant were",
          "We walked from the center of the city up to the ski jump. It was a nice walk. But some of the paths up to the ski jump were a bit steep. You could also take a bus there. It was an awesome site to go up to the top of the ski jump and look directly from the vantage point of",
          "Check out the weather forecast and book a table in clear weather - the breakfast is good, the view over Innsbruck is amazing and both are worth the price and the hike from the tram ;)",
          "Im glad we did this. The views are great, it was not crowded, and we had a delicious lunch up there which surprised us. Don't forget to go up to the torches, there is more information there and a little room off to the side with pictures of it back in the day.",
          "This is one of those attractions you watch on TV a hundred times, but to actually see where Olympic ski jumping takes place is quite a site. Going to the top of the tower is breathtaking too. The views of the mountains, and Innsbruck are amazing. There is even a restaurant,",
          "This was the home for the Youth Winter Olympics in 2012. The facility is in shape, has an observatory at the very top with a restaurant, the views are wonderful since you can see the city and the mountains at the same time. It would be great to see a competition happening !!",
          "The bergisel restaurant has a spectacular view but the restaurant here has a typical snobbish attitude. If u are ok with it, this is a place to be for a bite. Good tables will always be reserved for locals and the staff is not at all helpful or courteous. Select choice but",
          "We walked here as we had some time to kill in Innsbruck en-route to our ski holiday. Fantastic views and a nice bar at the top. not the friedliest service we had in Innsbruck though. The views and the walk made up for it. you can get the tram no 1 back to the city centre.",
          "There is more to this complex than they present or that meets the eye. Plenty to do and see in addition to just going up the top. If you have the energy, walk down the steps inside to see photos of great ski jumpers of yesterday. Then outside walk down the stairs to the",
          "I had no idea... I was very impressed. If you have never seen one, this is a great one to see. You can go to the top and view the Alps on a clear day. Beautiful views. Has a small but cool photo room. Also, a restaurant with great views. You can take tram 1 to the end and then",
          "I\u00b4ve been here many times with visiting relatives and friends,nothing like Apfelstr\u00fcdel and Coffee watching the Ski-jumpers practice,in Summer! Get a City Card to keep prices of admission down and the Ski Jump is right next to the Military Museum and Tirol Museum which are both",
          "Great views definitely worth a visit just a shame that the male waiter in the restaurant was so rude when we went to sit at a table with no reserved sign on it we were told we could not. Not worth paying the over expensive prices go to the panorama cafe where the staff are",
          "Visited this ski jump in September when there was no snow but we wanted to have a look at it. Access is right to the door with the Innsbruck travel pass being used on the bus. Whoever jumps from the top of it must be mad!! Whilst we were there, the sprinklers were turned on to",
          "Went there as we were passing by every time we were driving to ski and we finally stopped on our way back. E view is exceptional and i took great pics.",
          "Took a trip after breakfast and we were pretty much on our own at this iconic site. What a hero Eddie the Eagle was! His photo is among the greats on the staircase. Wonderful views, super architecture by our own Zaha Hadid. And a bar serving prosecco. What's not to like.",
          "Stayed in innsbruck over new year been before and seen ski jump at garmish I have to say the bergisal jump is more spectacular. With the city as a backdrop . These jumpers are truly fearless . Just one down side you have to park in town and the severely steep walk put o the",
          "Got the free tram to here (3 mins tram journey). Great views from the top of the jump. They were getting it ready so didnt see any jumps, but was nice just to be up there in the sunshine! Buy the innsbruck card and access to this is free (think its about 10euro each otherwise)",
          "This is just another ski jump and of little interest for those not interested in winter sports.I have toake 300characters so this is a coplete waste of tieforsiethig of of value at all.",
          "We visited it on very hot summerday, but it doesn't matter that there was no snow. We saw the ski-jumping training jumps anyway! It was very interesting to our sons, we drove up with air-tram with that jumper and then saw him jumping. Up there is very beatyful view at Innsbruck",
          "This was an unexpected addition to our tour and so glad it was!The Austrian Ski Jump team were practising and we could have stayed for hours.Lovely views all around.",
          "It was a moving experience visiting this olympic park. We stood at the top of the ski jump and had fun taking photos by the Olympic rings. Great views!",
          "We visited the ski jump during the Springtime, so we had to imagine the jump being covered in snow! The best part, is the fact that they have a restaurant up at the top of the ski jump. We ate lunch there. Fantastic experience! Once in a lifetime. Great view, of course,",
          "This is a great opportunity to see the huge ski jump up close from above and below. We went up by lift - you can look right over where the skiers push off - then we walked down the steps alongside the jump area and right down to the spectator's arena. It gives you a great",
          "What a fantastic experience. We were staying in Innsbruck and took the city tour, including the 1976 Olympic ski jump venue\u2026..such a treat and a must see if you visit this iconic city.",
          "The view from the top of the ski jump is amazing. Worth going up to the top and seeing where the athletes jump.",
          "As far as we are concerned, this is good to visit as a non-competitor. It is good to visit during Summer as it is warm and comfortable to walk around. As a skiier, the view at the end of the jump is a bit unnerving... the graveyard of the church in the valley!",
          "I would not go out of my way to see this- but if you are an Olympics fan- perhaps! This is leftover form the Innsbruck Olympics and it is amazing that is is so close to town.",
          "Not much to see other than where the ski jumping events were held but still worth the view. Great view of the alps in the background",
          "I would recommend a quick trip to the ski jump if you have time in Innsbruck. I had never seen one before and it was interesting. There is a tram to the top, and cafe in the building at the top. Check it out, it is on the Tram route from Central HBF.",
          "I'm not a huge fan of winter olympics, but being here really made me feel like a part of it. We were lucky to see someone practicing! Great views and just overall a very well built place. We had bought the Innsbruck card so we used the sightseer bus to get here by getting off",
          "Drove to the car park (reasonable cost for the couple of hours that we were there), but finding a space can be very tricky, and unlike some people who were there, bought a family ticket which some may feel is expensive, and went up in the vehicle to the first station. Took lots",
          "Ski jump is located on the one of the hill close to Innsbruck above the highway (which is leaded in tunnel). It is good place to observe city panorama. You can reach this place by 30-40 minutes slow walking from city center or you can arrive here by tram (10 minutes ride from",
          "Wherever we went in Innsbruck we could see this ski jump so we walked until we found it. For a small fee we could get in and catch a lift up to the top. The view is simply phenomenal. The valley is spread out below. Going through the restaurant we could see the view from the top",
          "From the ski jump you have a great view on Innsbruck while having a cup of coffee and a piece of cake. Especially the balcony from which you look straight along the jump-off platform.",
          "Very good ski jump and great views of city from top. However, it is not easy to go with small kids to the top. Even not being winter, we could see some people practicing.",
          "The ski jump facility was neat if you haven't seen one before. The fact that the Olympics were held here ads some charm. What we really liked, though, was the view out over the valley and the city. Some great panoramas here. In addition, below the jump near the parking area,",
          "I very much enjoyed my visit to Bergisel. As a big Olympics fan, this was a must-see for me in Innsbruck, and I wasn't disappointed. Having the Innsbruck Card meant that I didn't have to pay any entrance fee. (The Innsbruck Card was a great purchase since every attraction I",
          "I am a huge fan of ski jumping. Even though I have mixed feelings about this one. The entrance fee is not the cheapest, and although I have never been on a ski jump and the view from the top terrace is amazing I am just not convinced that it's a must-see-attraction. If you",
          "This attraction is included in Innsbruck pass and was a very interesting place to visit. nothing to dislike",
          "It's a bit of a hike from the tour station up the mountain, but the cable car does the really hard part and the view from the station is worth it. There's a nice cafe, with authentic Austrian white sausage, and other local food to savor while experiencing the panorama. Take a",
          "The best part about the Bergisel-skijump is the Brunch in combination with the marvelous view! Although the ride to the top with the elevator can be booked separately it is highly recommendable to enjoy the buffet as well! Unfortunately it is very popular and an early",
          "A must visit for anyone coming to Innsbruck. I've seen the place every day but the tram ride and the walk up was amazing. Entry price was 20Euros for me an my daughters.",
          "What a ski jump - it'll take your breath away. Even w/o snow, it awesome to view from the bottom, and especially from the top. Be prepared for some serious walking and stair climbing.",
          "We are Olympic skiing fans and were excited to see this but were disappointed. It is tired and clearly deteriorated. The views are not as great as we hoped. We did not eat in the restaurant.",
          "I personally went because I am fascinated by this sport and courage involved. Quite a walking effort to get there, unless you catch a STB bus, which is costly. Once you are there, the venue doesn't attract that much attention, but instead people enjoy dining in the tower. The",
          "a wonderfull view on the Inn-valley, thrilling to have a look from the point where the ski-jumpers start downward, and also a restaurant with nice pastas and austrian food, ideal for lunch",
          "good, buy a Innsbruck card it is well worth the money.A great view of the city. The restaurant is expensive.",
          "The ski jump is a must do like many other attractions in Innsbruck, the cafe at the top is also a must do , the hot chocolate served there in the cold was nice to order",
          "Not sure what I expected, it was a pleasant walk to it, the price to get in wasnt as steep as the jump but certainly not cheap for what you're getting. Ultimately its a ski jump and that's it. Wouoldn't go again but I suppose I'm glad I went. Very average but what should I have",
          "Seeing the jump from the top & in person provides a new perspective for this event! It was really amazing and well worth it.",
          "Would recommend though as being, you will see at the top you have a best view over the city Innsbruck, then just walk around and enjoy !!",
          "Good views from there, but really for 10 Euro entry fee I'd expect that. It is daunting to see the angle of the hill where the skiers land and would probably have a great atmosphere when an event is on, but otherwise I didn't think it was overly special. Would recommend though",
          "If you get the chance go here...there arnt many things that make you gobsmacked, but this is really up there on the list. The restraraunt at the top is very good and with costs that are not targeted at the tourist trade. An excellent afternoon...only tip is to use the",
          "Once you get at the top you have a spectacular view over Innsbruck ! Staff at the restaurant on top are not so good, quite slow.",
          "We caught the courtesy bus (free with the Innsbruck card) up to here, otherwise it would have been a real slog uphill ! Views are marvellous, a walk round the old stadium, just looking at the height of the ski jump gave me shivers. Cafe at the top was expensive (to be",
          "Bergisel is definitely worth a visit and I would love to go there and watch some actual ski jumping. The architecture is stunning and the trip to the top is very good. The actual view from the top is stunning and you begin to get an idea how daunting it must be to do the ski",
          "This ski jump looks deadly awesome. one must be professional to use this ski jump . One look at this just gives one an adrenal rush.",
          "The view there is very nice like what the other reviewer wrote, but I found it very unpleasant on top of the viewing platform because of the other visitors. I am not sure if there is a sign up there to prohibit people from smoking, but It was so full of smokers!!!! I did not",
          "There was more snow when we were there than there was a few weeks later when the Four Hills ski jumping tournament was on. If you are in Innsbruck then The Innsbruck Card is well worth having, as it covers transport and entry fee for a whole range of attractions. You can get to",
          "Had a great lunch there, overlooking the Ski Jump.....there were a couple of jumpers practising which was great. The view over Innsbruck was stunning!",
          "The Innsbruck card is a must, a no brainer, if you want to go up the mountain once. If you have time to do other things, then I would visit this. It is an awesome sight to see the view the jumpers get, but I don't think it is worth the admission fee alone. Would recommend",
          "This is a must see as the view is simply amazing. Beautiful walk up to the ski jump complex once dropped off from the tourist bus. It probably could be better signposted from the drop off point but is a lovely walk up there and once into the complex a lot of steps to walk up",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this ski jump. We went on a saturday afternoon and it wasnt that busy. Its better to get there (if not driving) by the sightseeing bus (\u20ac6.50PP). Dont be fooled when you get off the bus though as you will see a restaurant and museum. You need to",
          "While the road is winding and somewhat difficult to find, we enjoyed the visit to the lift. We had lunch at the top of the lift which was amazing. Both the food and the view! Spectacular view and nice lunch! We had only a salad and soup but very good! I think total tab was only",
          "just to go up there and to see what they see is awsome it would take a heck of an athlete to do this for a sport it is worth the price.",
          "We visited the jump and were amazed at the view in the restaurant at the top and the perspective it gave you. We just got a glass of wine at the restaurant and it was worth the scene.",
          "We thought this was a great experience.... to see what a ski jumper experiences as they are ready to make the jump. View of the Alps and Innsbruck are fantastic. Little surprised at how uncomfortable the seats must be at the bottom of the hill in the stadium, nothing but",
          "This Bergisal Ski Jump one must visit. It was designed by a renouned Artist, one can see this from the city of Innsbruck, you cant miss it. It has a lovely restaurant on the top....",
          "Tremendous view of Innsbruck. Looking down the sky jump you understand how insane the athletes must be. There is a restaurant at the top to get a meal or snack. Even with the view surrounded by plexiglass I wanted to back up from the ledge.",
          "This was a bit scary for me as I'm scared of heights but the views really are worth it. After seeing the jump on TV, it was great to see it in person and get a feel of just how high it is and to realise how brave those jumpers are! The hop-on/off bus drops you nearby and then",
          "Stopped during a motorbike tour of Europe. I'm no chicken but you wouldn't catch me doing this, well, there is a Graveyard at the bottom .... Young Guys were dryslope ski-juming when we were there, which was unexpected, NUTTERS! It was a good 5-min uphill walk up to the",
          "Very nice view of city below while dining at the Panorama Restaurant. If you enjoy mountain scenery, it's a cable car ride you shouldn't miss.",
          "This was on of our highlight while visiting Innsbruck. While we were there the Austrian Ski Jumping team were busy practicing and we could watch them practice!! The views up there of Innsbruck is beauitiful!!",
          "I went to the museum first which was cheap for students (4 euro) and they offer a museum and ski jump dual ticket that i did not know about until I got to the ski jump. It is a easy afternoon activity that takes under a hour or two. On fridays there is live practice jumping",
          "Not good unless you have some skiers practicing there. You got good view of the town but there are places where you will get better views.",
          "From the town it looks quite small but when you approach it, you appreciate the height of the jumps. Made me feel giddy just looking at the jumps Would like to visit during the winter to see them in action..",
          "really worth a visit : beautiful construction (from architect Zaha Hadid), very impressive, beautiful view You can easily walk to it from the city centre, and visit the Witten basilica and the monastery",
          "To add to our collection of Olympic centres visited, we decided to check out the ski jump. It is well worth the effort. The views from the top are absolutely magnificent. We were event fortunate enough to see someone practising the ski jump (in August!), which added to the",
          "Visited in June 2013, quite quiet just a few people visiting. Fun going up the cable car and then up in the lift to the top. Fantastic panoramic views of innsbruck and mountains which makes it well worth the effort. We travelled here via the sightseer bus which is a good way",
          "We had an amazing time visiting this Ski Jump.We had fun going up the Lift and the view from the Top was breathtaking.The stadium is wonderful and so is the resturant on the Top. If you are with family, you get a family Discount also.!!!",
          "What a sight! I was there many times because it's truly impressive. The new Bergisel ski jump stadium towering high above Innsbruck and is absolutely lovely. Just a few minutes from the center you will reach the origin where you can use two comfortable lifts to get to the top.",
          "...if you do, the views are stunning. If you're slightly faint-hearted, like myself, take the (self-service) funicular and then walk out to the point where the jumpers take to the air...it's still stunning, and fills you with admiration for thecompetitiors. It's also worth",
          "To get a nice view over the city, and the surrounding mountains this is the place to go. If you are lucky you can watch aircraft approaching Innsbruck airport from \"above\". The restaurant one the top is not worth the money.",
          "The view is great. You have to take a funicular followed by an elevator. Once you get to the top the view is great but the viewing platform is rather small so it can get crowded. As an added bonus you can see the Olympic cauldrons at the stadium at the bottom of the ski jump.",
          "An interesting place to visit with some good views. Used the Innsbruck card which was good value for money.",
          "It was good to go and see. A little on the pricey side to go to the top in the funicular but having said that you can't go and not venture up there ! I couldn't get over just how short a distance the skiers have to stop once they've landed. Cafe at the top. Good views over",
          "The Ski Jump could be seen from the back of our hotel so it was great to wake up and see this. You are reminded of the wonderful olympic spirit and the efforts of the worlds athletes. Worth a look.",
          "I took the tram to the end stop and then a short walk to the base of the Ski Jump. The Olympic Rings are still there is the stadium, which is in a bit of disrepair now. The railway to the top runs every 5 min and then there is a lift tot he top of the jump. Great view - don't",
          "Okay, I didn't try this, but I can rate it as the top ski jump in the world, based on the several that I've seen. I can't imagine a more dramatic setting. The jump is located on a hill south of downtown Innsbruck and it looks over the whole city below it. Most other hills level",
          "You can't see this just anywhere, and it is a place of history without being a thousand years old and crumbling. It was in walking distance from our hotel (although not well marked by signage) and was only 9 Euros to ride the car up to the structure. Excellent spot for picture",
          "We had wonderful views from the top but Euro 9 to go up the short funicular was very expensive! The hop on hop off stops here so convenient to get off and walk around.",
          "This is just another place if you are not a ski enthusiast. Though, keeping in mind that this was built for Olympic events, I'd suggest going here when there are competitions so that it is actually possible to see the live action..",
          "If there is no Olympic event or any other events it would be waste of time going all the way up. There is a Museum, but not sure that would excite much. Better buy the Innsbruck Card which cost 31EUR, valid for 24 hours from time of first swipe, its worth as all the attraction,",
          "This is covered on the Innsbruck card and totally worth it. The hop on/hop off stops a short walk from the entrance, and there's a cable car trip to the top which is included in the admission. Looking down and imagining people jumping into a stadium full of people is an",
          "We decided to catch the hop on hop off bus to Bergisel but got off one stop too early so we had to walk up a very steep and windy path with two small children in tow. The ski jump is a little run down now but the ride up in the cable car to the top was fine and we ended the",
          "The ski jump is amazing. The view from up there is unreal. My dad had to take us there because of all the memories he had watching the event. The town itself is also impressive.",
          "It is unreal standing at the top and imagining what must have been going through the mind of Eddie the Eagle. Great cafe at the top too. Take a look, it's worth the trip.",
          "i took the hop on off bus and this was one of the stops. it's worth getting off, getting a look and walking around. I did not spring for 9 euros to go to the top as i think that's too much. you can still get a good look from the surrounding area if you're willing to walk a",
          "This was impressive to see and it is difficult to find the entrance once you get off the bus...but well worth it. I was amazed at how high it actually was. I suggest going to the cafe at the top and enjoying a cappuccino or glass of wine while taking in the breathtaking views of",
          "A bit of a challenge to find the entrance if you use the STB tram or the ST line bus and get off at the Sonnenbugerhof stop. You need to initially follow the signs for the entrance and then work your way around the bottom of the ski jump fence to find the entrance. Worth the",
          "I went to see the Olympic ski jump whilst in Innsbruck and really wasn't expecting it to be quite so big, had seen it on the TV and didn't think much of it but I can tell you it's high. Its good visually to look at but once youve been to the top there isnt much else to do, You",
          "We took the local bus (I think it was the #1 Red Bus) and it drops you off right at the bass. I think it costs 2 Euros each way so bring coins. You can go to the top and have the view the ski jumpers have when they are ready to jump. Amazing!",
          "dont think i would like to take the plunge but worth seeing especially when lit up at night. This is a wee bit of a walk outside the central areas but worth going to see.",
          "Wow!! I have watched televised ski jumping events for years and was mesmerized, but now having seen the jump up close and personal - again - WOW! It was rainy when we visited, but as we stood at the far end of the \"bowl\" from the jump, all of a sudden a skier came sailing off",
          "Unfortunately our available weekend for going up was shrouded in mist and rain, but through the brief breaks in the clouds the view was awesome. The plan was to make the trek up there and have lunch; not much we could do about the weather, but the lunch itself was",
          "An experience we never thought we'd have - getting SO close to the ski jump! Amazing to see the view from the ski jumper's perspective as well as observing the workforce preparing the slope for use.",
          "Once at the top, the views are awesome. Just a quick tram ride away from the centre of town to reach the ski jump centre.",
          "It is quite a hike up to the top of the Bergisel Ski Jump, but you are rewarded with one of the most amazing views anywhere on this planet, in my opinion. The food is classical Tyrolean and of a high quality. The party of six I was with thoroughly enjoyed the food. The only",
          "Pick a clear day. Great views of the city and surrounding valley. Restaurant at the top of Jump. Available when not reserved for groups.",
          "We were traveling as part of a tour group, so we only had the opportunity to briefly stop here and did not get to actually go up to the top. However, it ended up being the perfect time as we were able to see a skier jump two separate times. Since there was still no snow at that",
          "included in the Inverness pass. You get to walk around the seating, take the lift up to the top where there is a viewing tower and restaurant. Good for views of the city and mountains. As you walk along there are boards with explanations. 30 mins to see most everything.",
          "Easy to get to and excellent to view the ski slope. Also it had a fantastic restaurant on the very top with good food and reasonable prices, and great views.",
          "Try and do this one before the Nordkettenbahnen because the view only gets better. Amazing ski ramp. Nice restaurant at the top You might see practice jumps.",
          "I Never had any idea that they built these man made ski jumps soooo high. You can see the Bergisel Ski Jump from the Top of the Alps on the other end of Innsbruck. The jump is perfectly framed by Innsbruck's Arc de triomphe and gateway to the city. We did not go up the funicular",
          "It's a very nice thing to do in Innsbruck. It's ideal when you enjoy watching winter sports and don't have much time in Innsbruck, go to Bergisel, the view is really good and the place is incredible, when you get up there, you can't believe the jumpers can actually do something",
          "Its got the best viewing terrace in Innsbruck. There is not much to do except to take the ride right upto the top of the ski jump. One gets sweeping views of the town and all its surrounding areas.",
          "Best view to the city a little difficult if you don't have a car but they do have public transportation",
          "Innsbruck, this calm city may offer many attractions, however, the Ski Jump Stadium at Bergisel is the one that truly deserves to be the icon of this placid city of Tyrol. Located strategically on the periphery and skirted by Tyrolean mountains, this inviting structure has",
          "everything well oranized :bus or parking, few walking steps only to the entrance. The small cable car takes you to the station, (or you ca walk ). The elevator takes you to the top (or you can walk ). The view from the top is amazing , and you can stand exactly over the start",
          "A bit of a walking up to do before arriving at the entrance, then there are two elevators - we had lunch there - very good food and the magnificent views of the mountains - just breathtaking",
          "Used the Innsbruck card to visit the Bergisel ski jump. Interesting to see how they practice their ski jumps. It was great the day we went as there was a guy practicing his jumps.",
          "The views from the top are great and it is fun to go up and see what it would be like to jump off.",
          "Looks like it has seen better days although the views over the city were very good and the restaurant had good views and niceties on offer for those who were hungry.THE FUNICULAR ride to the top was interesting although not as spectacular as some that we have been on.",
          "A little cable 'train' takes you to the top of the jump. The view is staggering! How they jump off into mid-air is amazing! Great photography chances here. Good food in the cafe is served quickly. Really well worth the experience.",
          "The Bergisel ski jump is steeped in histry (unfortunaly some sad, like the 1999 stampede that killed 5 people) but this is a great place to visit. It is free if you purchsed the Innsbruck Card - the hop-on, hop-off bus stops nearby, also free with the card - and after a short",
          "We bought the Innsbruck Pass and tried to visit Bergisel the first day of our pass. We asked the man working there if anyone would be jumping that day. He told us that nobody would jump that day, but they would the next. So, we waited and didn't go in that day. We had bought",
          "This is one of the greatest architecture design in my opinion. Being here to watch the ski jump competition at that time, which is regularly held in Innsbruck. Dont forget to came here and enjoy the city from above. You can take tram number 1 until its final destination",

          "I often take visitors to visit the ski jump as it really does provide one of the best views of the town - it is especially beautiful around the time the sun sets. It is however quite expensive to visit by itself (around \u20ac8), which is why I would (like other reviewers) suggest",
          "Brilliant view from the restaurant. It's worth going for a coffee and the apple strudel. If you get a $29 day pass from the tourist information it includes bus pass and access to multiple places, so would advise purchasing this.",
          "From the top of the tower there is a very good view over Innsbruck, also the Caf\u00e9 up there offers apart form coffee, cakes and snakes and dishes this great panorma. Unfortunately it isn't possible to get to the caf\u00e9 without paying a visitor's fee for the whole ski jump area.",
          "The ski jump is fantastic, just the dimension and design are impressive, but when you combine that with being in Innsbruck and surrounded by the Austrian Alps, it is hard to beat. You can take a lift to the top and an observation deck. There's also a restaurant that has the",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970. The 1976 Winter Olympics were the last games held in the German-speaking Alps (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland).\nAlong with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Lake Placid, New York in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games. It also hosted the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics.\nInnsbruck hosted the 1st Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012.Innsbruck also hosts one of the 4 ski-jumping competitions of the 4 Hills Tournament every year.\nOther notable events held in Innsbruck include the Air & Style Snowboard Contest from 1994 to 1999 and 2008 and the Ice Hockey World Championship in 2005. Together with the city of Seefeld, Innsbruck organized the Winter Universiade in 2005. Innsbruck's Bergiselschanze is one of the hills of the famous Four Hills Tournament.\nInnsbruck is home to the football club FC Wacker Innsbruck, which plays in the Austrian Football Bundesliga (first tier) as of the 2018\u201319 season. Former teams include the FC Swarovski Tirol and FC Tirol Innsbruck. FC Wacker Innsbruck's stadium, Tivoli Neu, is one of eight stadiums which hosted Euro 2008 which took place in Switzerland and Austria in June 2008.\nThe city also hosted an American Football final, Eurobowl XXII between the Swarco Raiders Tirol and the Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna.\nThe city hosted opening round games in the 2011 IFAF World Championship, the official international American Football championship.\nIn 2018 Innsbruck hosted the IFSC Climbing World Championships 2018 from September 6 to September 16 and the 2018 UCI Road World Championships from September 22 to September 30.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nInnsbruck is a substantial tourist centre, with more than a million overnight stays.\nIn Innsbruck, there are 86,186 employees and about 12,038 employers. 7,598 people are self-employed. Nearly 35,000 people commute every day into Innsbruck from the surrounding communities in the area. The unemployment rate for the year 2012 was 4.2%.The national statistics office, Statistik Austria, does not produce economic data for the City of Innsbruck alone, but on aggregate level with the Innsbruck-Land District summarized as NUTS 3-region Innsbruck. In 2013, GDP per capita in the NUTS 3-region Innsbruck was \u20ac41,400 which is around 60% above the EU average.The headquarters of Tiroler Wasserkraft (Tiwag, energy production), Bank f\u00fcr Tirol und Vorarlberg (financial services), Tiroler Versicherung (insurance) and MED-EL (medical devices) are located in Innsbruck. The headquarters of Swarovski (glass), Felder Group (mechanical engineering) and Swarco (traffic technology) are located within 20 km (12 mi) from the city.\nResidential property is very expensive by national standards. The average price per square metre in Innsbruck is \u20ac4,430  (2015), which is the second highest per square metre price among Austrian cities surpassed only by Salzburg (\u20ac4,823), but followed by Vienna (\u20ac3,980).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nInnsbruck is located along the A12/A13 highway corridor (Inn Valley Autobahn and Brenner Autobahn respectively), providing freeway access to Verona, Italy and Munich, Germany. The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates.\nInnsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations. During the winter, activity increases significantly, due to the high number of skiers travelling to the region. The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck.\n\nLocal public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes.  The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and V\u00f6ls in the west . Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.\nIn December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension across the Inn River and into central Innsbruck.  The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.  The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour.

          "The most exciting thing on the Alpenzoo is going there by the Nordkette Bahn. It was ok but not spectacular. Many reptiles were hiding or invisible. It was nice to be able to be in the same room as some big birds like an eagle. We've spend about 2 hours there.",
          "We spent lazy 2 hours there and were able to see quite some interesting animals. A few were still having their winter sleep, but the bears are already awake. Small zoo, so not much walking required, and it's not so steep like some comments say. I like that they also have some",
          "Admission cost 12 euro per adult. Got to see some rare species and many different kinds of birds. I don't think I had seen 2000 animals though. Most of them were enclosed. Expect a lot of walking and climbing up slopes. Some of the slopes were rather steep.",
          "This was somewhere we had highlighted as a place we wanted to visit in Innsbruck. A beautiful zoo, we went early to avoid crowds. Fair to say that perhaps not all the animals were awake yet - but we saw most animals so were very happy. You had to look hard for a few - the cats",
          "We went because it was included in the Innsbruck card but this turned out to be one of the best parts of the trip! The animals are all alpine and the view is spectacular. There\u2019s a bear and some really interesting animals. Don\u2019t overlook this",
          "It is a small zoo on the mountain and it has some area for animals, small aquarium, farm animal section and small playground. But as it is on the mountain, not easy with trolley or something for a weak person - not a hike but you may move a bit up & down.There are not many",

          "We visited the zoo in the hopes of seen an otter. There were none to be found in their enclosure. We found the enclosures large, but unkept. The water in most enclosures was dirty and full of algae which had bloomed in the wolf enclosure causing foam on the surface of the water.",

          "It is probably due to it being winter, but there really was not that many animals to see. Important to remember, they only exhibit animals and birds from the tirol valley, so if your after mountain lions,bears etc. Not a chance. Kids and bird watchers will be happy, if you want",

          "Very few animals and most appeared to. It get much attention from the staff. Lots of standing water to walk through on the paths. Wayfinding was unclear and confusing. Directions to find it were difficult.",
          "On the way down from the mountain we stopped and were very impressed! This was a fun walk, great exhibits, and plenty of animals. I read a few review that called this a \"small\" zoo but that is too generic. There are quite a few sites, lots of animals, and it is a very",
          "On my descent from Hafelekar I stopped at the Alpenzoo which includes admission with the Innsbruck Card. It\u2019s a short walk from the station to the zoo. There\u2019s a small gift shop and a bistro in the main building. There are 29 varieties of animals / birds. With it being December",
          "The zoo is fairly OK!! It has too much of walking over the small hills to view the animals and bird. I would recommend more Salzburg zoo than Innsbruck. One thing which attracted me here was the lynx",
          "If this isn't your first Zoo you've ever stopped to see, then I would suggest passing. None of the animals were out when I visited and there are more exciting things to do in Innsbruck as a visitor than this zoo.",

          "This isn't one of the great zoo of the world but it's a nice little stop off on the way up the mountain for those with young kids. Quite a lot of the enclosures are empty. Some of these contain animals that are hibernating , while others just seem to be lacking animals. The",
          "We felt that the zoo was not a very good attraction to visit in winter there are not very many animals to see and the bears looked bored just walking up and down maybe it is better to visit in spring and summer We were quite disappointed",
          "This zoo is dedicated to the fauna of the alpine region and is SO worth a visit. It is not a huge zoo but has great variety and some very special animals indeed. In fact there are birds, reptiles and even fish on view that are endemic to the alpine region, which makes this zoo",
          "The zoo was of excellent value, the animals all seemed well cared for and were in excellent condition. They were in spacious areas but the layout was such that you could easily see all of them and observe their behaviour. Many of the areas were walk through, enabling you to get",
          "The zoo is very especial because of its location on the mountains. It\u2019s fun to go up more and more in order to see the animals. There is a public bus that takes you to the entrance of the zoo up on the mountain.",

The zoo is located on the side of the mountain, with the buildings and enclosures imaginatively placed to make the most of the geography of the site. Some of the footpaths are quite steep but are laid out to",
          "The zoo is worth a visit, especially with smaller children. It is a nice little \u201ehike\u201c up and downhill and the views into The Valley are great. Unfortunately there was a lot of building, renovating etc going on, so some ways were blocked and you felt like walking through a",

          "Decided to visit and bought a ticket combined with the funicular which just took us up two stops so didn't get much of a view. However back to the zoo. It hosts alpine wildlife but some of the pens seemed empty or under repair. The Lynx were nice to see and wildcats but it",

          "Alpenzoo is the stop to see the wildlife of aspen region it has a lot of different animal and kids do enjoy the wildlife",
          "We\u2019re so glad we visited this zoo. The focus on alpine fauna is unique, and a real plus for overseas visitors. The conservation programs are fascinating, and we could\u2019ve watched the lynx kittens all day. If you visit on a sunny day you\u2019ll also get great views across Innsbruck.",
          "Zoo was a disappointment. Very few animals. Not well maintained. There were some nice views overlooking Munich from the zoo but that was about it. I would not recommend.",
          "They\u2019ve done a nice job of designing the zoo into the contours of the mountains. They have all kinds of animals there and it\u2019s laid out nicely. They have an English pamphlet when you enter that allows you to understand where everything is.",
          "Well laid out zoo showing alpine fauna in near natural habitats. Very interesting. Bring your German phrase book, because there are only a few concessions made to international anglophone visitors. And beware the staff in the shop/ticket office. They seem quite unhappy and",
          "very enjoyable. Loved the lynx family. We watched the mum gather up her cubs and feed them whilst the dad snoozed in a tree. Fish tank was great and very relaxing to watch.",
          "We went up part way since it was a very overcast/rainy day. On the way back we hit the zoo. Stroller friendly, but you will be pushing up and down lots of hills. This is bigger than expected. It was nice weather, not hot and we got to see almost all of the animals. We went",
          "This zoo is not one of the best i've seen. There are some good enclosures, but also quite a few outdated and small ones - there's definitely potential for improvement. The zoo shows exclusively local animals, no exotics. This is a great and interesting concept. Among the",
          "The Alpine Zoo is a great place to spend a day, especially with a family. The whole area is beautifully set in an alpine environment with an opportunity to see typical animals up close. To make it more interesting and fun, I recommend to take the Hungerburgbahn from Central",
          "My children had fun seeing animals they don't commonly see in other zoo. The Alpenzoo has the biggest freshwater aquarium, and the observation area has seats provided where one can relax while watching the different species of fishes. There is also an area where one can pet some",

          "The zoo planning is well thought out, but not finished, possibly because of lack of funding. It is very suitable for children or school classes, but I felt a bit bored and pitied the animals. My advice is to go either very early in the morning or just before closing time. The",
          "I enjoyed the zoo and I am usually a bit dubious of visiting zoo's as often the areas are small etc. Being able to see animals such as the ibex and chamois was great.",
          "The hidden gem of the zoo is a river water aquarium: it's not that easy to find, but you can spend a long time watching it as it's really impressive and beautiful. Some animals have too little space, but in general it's a well-managed zoo.",
          "I have seen quite a few of zoos around Europe. So the idea of a thematic zoo with alpic animals was quite interesting. I visited the Zoo at the end of July. I went there with the Norkkette finicular (amazing exprerience). Both of them are included (among others) in the free",

          "We loved this place. Cheap to get in, lots of animals all with ample space to make them seem happy and well looked after. Made a brilliant stop over on our journey from Italy to southern Germany. Great views over Innsbruck and good, reasonably priced food at the cafe. Our son is",
          "This zoo was just OK, for our family a zoo without a lion is not a zoo. The biggest animals they have are the bear and bison. It will take 2 to max 3 hours to tour the full zoo as it has less than 30 habitats. Therefore you must plan this with other attraction/activity in",
          "The highest zoo in Europe. Well worth a trip up on the Hungerbergbahn. Very well set out if a little steep for us older folk ! A good selection of animals from wolves and lynx to bears. Definitely not forgetting vultures, eagles and, of course, marmots. Very busy with noisy",
          "An OK way to kill some time on your way down (or up) the mountain. You'll see a few cool cats in some trees. You might see a few other creatures too. Or not. Was pretty empty when we went. Had a bit of a sad feel to it. Overall not really worth the money.",
          "A great opportunity to view new animals in a natural habitat, well sign posted and explained, English available too. There are farm animals that allow direct contact and feeding which the kids enjoyed. We went as part of a trip up the Nordkette so good to combine.",
          "The zoo was very nice and quite clean. If you come from an area where you have a zoo, you might be disappointed because the variety of animals isn\u2019t as vast as a larger facility. Also, there is a lot of walking up/down hills - this was not an issue for our family and definitely",
          "the animals have great habitats. but get ready to walk. although you should expect that in zoo called alpine. absolutely loved it, we started are first day with this",
          "Got to see a variety of animals native to the area - many were new to us. Seemed a little pricey for what was available though. Easy to buy tickets when you get there - no need to buy in advance.",

          "It is a zoo with animals and birds which are naturally not easily seen commonly in many other zoos. It was beautiful to see that most animals and birds looked so well and healthy especially the family of lynx with its cubs. They were so playful and full of life and vibrancy.",
          "My wife is really into zoos so I figured I would take her to this one. We went through the whole thing in a little over an hour. We didn\u2019t see all the animals as most were feeding and/or avoiding the warmer summer temperatures. But the ones we did see were like most zoo animals",
          "It\u2019s actually one of the smallest i have visited and over rated online. The location is amazing and the surrounding areas too plus nice space but not well taken care of and no great facilities",
          "Simply put this is an outstanding experience that is well worth the time and effort. Relatively inexpensive and handy to get to. It's definitely a lovely way to spend the day, just allow plenty of time. There's lots to see and do.",
          "This is interesting but could be missed. Many enclosures were empty and it did show some signs of neglect and lack of maintainance. The pigs were in a rather crowded enclosure and I was very sorry for the cows who were crowded together and really needed more space, and maybe",
          "Great for families. Not to expensive. Interesting seeing bears up the side of the mountain. One of the things I guess you have to do when you visit.",

          "My friend & I arrived at the zoo and there were multiple groups of school children running around the place, of all ages. I like children but if I\u2019d known it was going to be so crowded we wouldn\u2019t have bothered. The enclosures were rather small & the animals looked bored. We",
          "What a wonderful idea to have a zoo on a mountain! We visited a number of animals but because of my mobility issues I had difficulty getting up to see some of the animals on the top. My favourite animals were the brown bears who were very active. This is a beautiful area",
          "My Wife and I went to the Alpenzoo. Absolutley Spectacular. You can hike up to it if you dont want to take the transportation. Lots of animals there! If you buy an innsbrucker card 3 day pass for 59 euros at your hotel this is included. There were some bears there that were very",
          "If you\u2019re from the U.S. the zoos are all pretty similar... cages and animals... often sad. This is a zoo on the side of the Alps! With native animals in their native environment. Was a great time for us all. Clean and animals happy. Some steep paths for those with really",
          "Th highlights of this zoo is probably alpen goat and bear. The bear is nothin special while the goat is well just a goat, not really majestic...Other animals looks plain ordinary nothin and if you have been to other zoos in other part of the world, might as well skip this",
          "Most of the animals were hidden, so for us it was more a sidewalk, than a ZOO visit. Nevertheless the concept is fine and if you have got Innsbruck card, than the entrance is free of charge.",
          "Animals looked unhappy, bears pacing up and down made for an uncomfortable visit. Cages are very small.",
          "This is a unique zoo perched on the hill overlooking Innsbruck. The steep terrain makes for interesting exhibits. Steep paths and a lot of vertical make it a harder go for people using strollers. Certainly take the train from downtown. The ride is amazing and brings you right",
          "The habitats are spacious and all have water features and options to hide. It\u2019s not one of these depressive Zoos where u feel sorry for the animals.",
          "We visited using our Innsbruck card after visiting the top of the mountain. There is a stop on the way down which was handy. The zoo is smallish but with the hills it seems much bigger. A good range of animals for such a small zoo with the brown bears being my favorite and great",
          "Not suitable for disabled person or those who don\u2019t like to walk. You\u2019ll need to walk up and down the hill to see different animals. Good for children, you can feed cow, sheep, and other farm animal.",
          "Very nice zoo this, the highest zoo in Europe, you access by it, but the little tram up the mountain which is a nice ride, then its a little walk to the actual zoo, lovely views all around, it was very hot when we went, but very enjoyable the animals are well looked after and",
          "I know that the Alpenzoo is involved in conservation projects, so quite frankly, all the more reason that this is unnecessary. I'm not involved with any animal rights groups or anything like that, but this place is sad. We went because we'd read so many good things, but at the",
          "Great place for animal lovers like me, surprisingly many kinds of different animals, clean and modern facilities, props for the great restahrant/caf\u00e9 at the entrance with traditional tirolyan foods, and the great gift shop downstairs too!",
          "Well laid out. Good signposting. Interesting animals. Note that the signposts from the Hungerberg say 20 minutes walk. Not true. It took 50 minutes but a pleasant walk.",
          "im not a huge zoo fan. i got the innsbruck card and the entrance was included so i went to the ski station then i went to the zoo. bad place, bad senialization, most signs only in local language. lonely animals in cages. i hated this place.",
          "We really enjoyed the Zoo. We walked down from the top. A little icy in places but manageable (we went in March). We had a drink and snack for lunch, good value for money. Lovely to be able to sit outseide on the balcony, Lots to see. Easy to follow free map provided. Good",
          "Quite a walk to do...Interesting in its own way. There isn't an amazing variety of animals, because they're exploring the concept of Alpine fauna, which is somewhat limited. But what's there is very well kept, and the animals look very well looked after.",
          "We stopped here on our way up the mountain. It was a very fun day for my kids, when sightseeing can sometimes not be so fun. We went in August 2017 and over 6 months later, they still talk about it. Is it the best zoo I've ever been to? No. But its clean, easy to",
          "We had a lot of fun seeing different types of animals even in the cold weather. Was easy to get around the zoo and see everything. There was a restaurant at the zoo with an amazing view of the mountains. It was a nice place to have a drink after enjoying the zoo. Would",
          "I am not a zoo fun, but this place was nice. I would recommend this place if you have a lot of time in the city.",

          "My son and I visited on 3rd Feb 2018 but had to leave after a short while as we were so upset by the appalling conditions, very small enclosures and no stimulation for the animals. Hard to believe that animals can be kept in such conditions in this day and age in the middle of",
          "I am no great fan of Zoo's to be honest and I was a little hesitant in visiting but it was free with the innsbruck card and the rest of the group wished to visit. We travelled via the funicular where there is a short walk up hill to the entrance this is not somewhere I would",

          "We are not familiar with Alpine animals...and since it is the first stop up the cable car it is easy to get to. We got there at opening 9am...and it was a thrill to see the howling wolves in the mist. Also the grizzly bear was something special. A small zoo...able to complete",
          "We went on a beautiful sunny day in December and what a stunning day to go to Alpenzoo! There had been a large snowfall the day before so with the sun out melting to snow it was like it was snowing with blue sky. We felt like VIPs because the zoo was so quiet. They have a good",
          "We visited the Alpenzoo over the New Year weekend. It was not too cold out so it was great to walk around and explore. We appreciated how the animals in the zoo were not your standard zoo animals but more natural to the region. Our young son truly enjoyed it, especially",
          "Really great experience. It was raining heavily for the whole visit but we didn\u2019t even care. Beautiful setting, hilly, large enclosures, animals appear well cared for. We saw the lynx feeding on meat in the viewing box and watched them climb up trees! The bears were amazing as",
          "I am an animal lover but have been put off zoo's in recent years as I find them to big, too busy, the animals are general too far away and the ones I do see look bored and/or stressed. This is the complete opposite. What an amazing experience. It is small enough to walk around",
          "Maybe it was the temperature but very few animals were spotted. However the most painful was watching the bears in such a restricted space, and one of the two bears was clearly distressed! Most fun was the feeding the farm animals. Another disappointment was that most of the",
          "Really nice environment, animals seemed happy and curious to see you. Well laid out and brilliant value compared to British zoos! As the name would suggest, it is in an alpine environment, so the path can be steep at places, however there were still families with young children",
          "I was disgusted by how little space the animals in the zoo have - for example two wolves, not even a pack, forced to live in an enclosure about 1/4 acre. I sat and watched the smaller of the two bears pace back and forth in obvious distress along the edge of the pool for at",
          "Only for the young and physically fit: to get to the zoo you have to climb a steep slope, and the zoo itself is set on a mountainside, with the entrance at the bottom of a series of steep paths, exhausting to scale and made terminally frustrating by the absence of critters to",
          "We stopped off at the zoo not really knowing what to expect- it turned out to be the highlight of our day - it was snowing all the time we were there and the setting was a spectacular winter wonderland- the animals were all clearly very well cared for and the views were simply",
          "We went in December and while it was pretty cold and snowy, we thoroughly enjoyed walking around and seeing the beautiful animals. We have a baby who slept the whole time, but my husband and I enjoyed it! Warning: as it\u2019s in the mountains it\u2019s very hilly.",

          "We stopped here on the way down in the funicular railway. Entry is free with an Innsbruck Card. The entire focus is on European alpine animals which was of interest to us. It does not have animals from other continents (ie. no lions, giraffes ect). The zoo is a short walk",

          "Such a lovely zoo, inexpensive to visit with family. Worth getting the combined ticket with the ski lift/tram into the city. Animals are all well cared for and have lovely enclosures. Nothing looked stressed like it so often can in a zoo setting. Very impressed. A great day out.",
          "This place is worth a look as there is some interesting animals which I don't normally see been an Aussie plus the zoo overlooks the city and has some amazing views, it's only a short trip by funicular then a short walk uphill to the zoo. If you don't have kids I'd allow 2hrs",
          "If you would like to see a big range of alpine animals, this zoo is very interesting. Get ready to walk up hills a lot, the whole zoo is on the side of a mountain. Your reward for walking up to the very top is the Ibex enclosure - these are smart looking cousins of deer with big",
          "My 7 year old daughter and I visited the zoo on our way down from the summit of the alps in Innsbruck and were not disappointed. We also got a lot of exercise as this was the first zoo we've been to that was on the side of a mountain and all the animals' habitats were either",

          "We walked from the city center, which is a nice climb up in the mountain. On a hot day, many of the animals seemed to be hiding away in the shadow, so there were a few of them we couldn't spot. Otherwise, nice place to spend an hour.",
          "Always nice to see animals that aren't bored or kept in ridiculously small cages. Walking through is very interactive, there's so much to see and learn. Loved it.",
          "We had a nice time in the zoo today. There is few hills to be walked but it was manageable with a pram. Playground and coffee Shop also in there. Nice little zoo to visit when you are in Innsburg with the family.",
          "Very interesting place with a lot of beautiful animals. I am not a big Zoo fan, but this one was really something. Take some good shoes though, the road was kind of steep.",
          "What I liked about this zoo was that it had a purpose - to showcase alpine animals. We had never before seen a lot of the animals housed at this zoo. We walked from Innsbruck main rail station to the zoo. It was a long, uphill walk, but was pleasant. We went back to Innsbruck",
          "Nice place to walk but don't expect to be impress by the animals... many are hidden, many cages emtpy... can Worth the visit if you don't have anything to do in Innsbruck.",
          "A great setting in the mountain above Innsbruck. Either drive up or come up by the train. The park areas is lovely and the animals are housed in natural surroundings. Some of the pathways are steep so not easy for some. Really enjoyable day for everyone",
          "The best zoo we have been to. Very cozy place in a beautyfull place, on the mountainside overviewing Innsbruck. Very steep walks must be expected. We paid 30 EUR for 2 adults and 2 kids age 12 and 9. Animals are easy to see and you walk by them all. Many of them from more",
          "We are from Canada and went with my 2 year old son, my 3 nephews and my niece and although the younger children were somewhat amused most of us are used to seeing these animals or animals very similar in Canada. So I wouldn't recommend if you're from Canada/North America, but",
          "Dedicated only to Alpine animals, this hillside zoo - and the up and down trails were a nice part of the experience - was a definite highlight not only of our trip to Innsbruck, but one of our 2-week trip to Austria. Enclosures are well maintained and seem nicely reflective of",
          "It isn't the biggest zoo, but it had some animals I hadn't seen in any other zoos, and some of the weird little horned mountain creatures were very amusing. It also has amazing views of the alps, with some great picnic spots. The little cafe was very affordable and had some",
          "Even though they have some unique species, I felt the overall experience was average. May be my expectations were big when I visited the zoo and hence the disappointment.",
          "Lovely setting & great for young children but I found it very disappointing. We hardly saw any animals, mainly the goats & the 2 bears. Everything else appeared to be hiding but for all I knew the enclosures could have been empty. Be prepared for a lot of walking, especially",
          "I went here in 1985 and thought it one of the best zoos I have ever seen. 32 years later and the opinion still stands. Alpenzoo is a zoo which exhibits the wildlife to be found in the Alps and is today one of the major tourist attractions of Innsbruck. I visited it first in",
          "I am not a fan of zoo because I don't really like the idea of seeing the animals trap in cage without their freedom. My friends wanted to visit as we were on the way to the peak on the mountain. All in all, the zoo is clean, it wasnt really crowed when I visit on a Thursday",
          "Worthwhile if you like zoos A lot of attention to the animals and good for familys.People need to be able to see animals to appreciate them and thus see the need to protect some environments for them.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Alpine Zoo, it's a lovely zoo and very different to what we have seen before. Fantastic to ride up on the cable car as well then stroll leisurely down the mountain.",
          "Nice couple of hours spent seeing the animals. Felt like the water needed a little cleaning in the water features but other than that was nice and interactive.",
          "That's the best zoo we have ever seen. We are a couple, we went there because we were in innsbruck for the vacations, and we didnt think that it was going to be that cool!",
          "This is a bit of a different zoo. The animals there are natural to the Alpine environment. This is a 'hiking' walk around up and around kind of zoo. Typical for the area, people like to trek. The exhibits are pretty roomy and the animals seemed well cared for. The black bears",
          "This is one of the worst zoos we have visited. The entrance fee was reasonable at \u20ac10/adult and \u20ac2.50/5 for children. But you get what you pay for. The walking trail from Nordkette to the zoo was nice.",
          "Small zoo located on the mountains - we took the cable car and got there pretty fast from the city center (Nordkette station next to the Theatre). You can get a combo ticket of 13\u20ac for both the trip and the zoo. The zoo itself is quite fine, with a lot of paths going up and down",
          "This zoo was way better than I expected, the animals were exciting and exotic if you've never seen a vulture or bear up close. We paid 13 euro to take the tram up to the zoo, there is a bus you can take as well. I would say that this suits all ages, but it's extra fun for the",
          "Spent the morning at the Alpen Zoo, included on Innsbruck Card as is travel there and higher up the Nordkette. Well laid out zoo with interesting collection of animals. Had a coffee on the verandah. Great view!",
          "The wife and I loved it, but after the first hour the kids got a little restless, despite all of the new sights around them. On a sunny day after the zoo walk, definitely go to the aquarium and amphibian display on level 1(?) near the entrance/exit..",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Alpine Zoo. I bought a ticket for a return cable car ride including the Alpine Zoo and it was so worth it! I was so delighted to see animals I'd never seen in real life before such as wolves. It's a small zoo but not too crowded which was",
          "it was wonderful to see alpine animals focused zoo as most zoos are quite similar. We enjoyed the steep climbs and took it as another workout in the Alps. The view from the cafe is great! and a coffee after two hours of walking was just heavenly! Some animals were asleep, but",
          "I have been there several times and spent a lovely time with my family. The perfect option for a one day activity enjoying the variety of animal live and species of the Alps.",
          "The tourist info will tell you to visit this Zoo , the highest Zoo in the Alps it seems , which is GREAT , what they don't tell you is that if you don't speak German stay away . Almost NONE of the animal enclosures had descriptions in any language other than German , why invite",
          "I had read bad reviews of the Alpenzoo on here before visiting however we were on the Nordkettenbahnen and figured we might as well stop off to visit. Free access with the Innsbruck card so also not a great loss. The animal enclosures were all small and didn't seem to offer the",
          "As it's built into a hill at the bottom of a mountain range, it should come as no surprise that the zoo itself has areas that can be a little steep for walking up and down - but the benefit is getting some lovely scenery. It's a small zoo and other than feeling that the Brown",
          "A nice place to see all caind of alpine animals, from predators to birds, fish and it's iven situated on the mountain :D",
          "We took a day out on our skiing trip. And our children really enjoyed seeing all the animals. As specially the room with a large fish tank where you can sit and relax. The food in the restaurant was really good. It was a very relaxing and fun day out. Only the brown bear looked",
          "My wife and I had a very pleasant 2 hour visit to Alpenzoo, and despite being the middle of February, most of the animals were available to see, had what appeared to be very suitable habitats, looked content, and the layout of the zoo was very good to get close to them - we",
          "We walked up to this zoo which took about 30 minutes from the town centre though there is a bus. The zoo is excellent and we got to see a bear close up, wolves, and eagles. My son loved it and it wasn't too big to take more than 90 minutes. The play equipment was",
          "We decided to visit the zoo on our way back from the ski resort and it was different due to the animals that we are use too in Africa. This is an activity for parents with young children as it is very educational",
          "Really interesting animals you don'T often see at a 'normal' zoo. Mooses are just awesome, as are some of the brids of prey. Otters are always a highlight too.",
          "Filled with alpine animal and snow (we went in winter) it was thankfully not filled with tourists. Particularly impressive were the wolves, moose and bear.",
          "You arrive at Europes highest Zoo by a cog railway from the Old Town The Zoo is beautifully landscaped on the side of a mountain , all animals looked well cared for and relaxed .A great map is provided so you can navigate your way around , birds , otters ,farm animals, bears",
          "The zoo is well laid out but some animals are small spaces and for such large animals. The water based environments are good for viewing.",
          "We had a combination ticket with the Nordkettenbahnen great value and would be fab for children it wasn't busy when we went but maybe because it was quite cold i think on more of a milder day it would be a bit more enjoyable.",
          "This is a great unusual Zoo! All the alpine animals and birds are kept beautifully in enclosures that offer them space and stimulation. We got there early so there were not too many people around. It was a beautiful clear day and the Zoo is set up high so has wonderful views",
          "Visited in January and this could be in the itinerary wen there s leisure time to visit. I visited from india and have been to better zoos than this. Though it was a good experience.",
          "Although not being a lover of zoos, this one is very well laid out with sufficient area for most of the animals and birds. There are some very good open areas for photography.",
          "we came on January all the animals ( if they are there) are unviable, it's okay if the people on the cashier will tell us and not overcharged. we felt somebody pull our lag. we have a biblical zoo in Jerusalem much nicer, you see the animals, and you can learn about them a lot.",
          "The zoo was a great change after 5 days of skiing. We enjoyed all the animals, especially the wolves and the bison! The tram ride up was beautiful and you can continue up on stop and have a breathtaking view of Innsbruck.",
          "Visiting in cold winter, some of the animals were hibernating, but it was still a very nice visit. There is a good variety of animals in natural mountain surroundings. The paths are quite steep, but this adds to the 'natural' feel. Hidden from, but quickly reached by the",
          "At first I thought this zoo would be disappointing since we visited in the winter when not all the animals were out, but fortunately I was wrong and had a blast. There were plenty of animals to see including wolves, eagles, lynx, moose, a bear, etc. It was very interesting how",
          "Our group of three adults and three children visited this zoo in December 2016. Our entrance into the zoo was free as we had the Innsbruck card. The zoo is on the mountain side above Innsbruck. The location is beautiful and the zoo is well laid out. Unfortunately, we did not",
          "We made this visit as it was the last thing to tick of our list from the Innsbruck card and we ended up leaving after 40 minutes. The enclosures were too small for the types of animals they had and the large brown bear was in such distress walking backwards and forwards in the",
          "I found it a waste of money as not much of animals were here .. no big animals .. we saw more of farm /alpine animals in this zoo with a section of reptiles . Though my kids liked it , it could have been avoided . Fish aquarium was a good attraction .",
          "We stopped off here on the way up to the cable car. It's a lovely area to stroll around and see animals you wouldn't usually get to see. It's on the side of the mountain so some areas are quite steep.",
          "The Alpenzoo is located just South of the Tram. We stopped for a visit; however, many animals were missing. Perhaps it is better in the Spring or Fall!",
          "We paid 18 euros to enter this Alpine Zoo and after walking up many steep hills and looking at many empty compounds we gave up. OK, we saw in the distance the head of a brown bear eating a Christmas tree and some strangely coloured black flamingoes. Then we had become bored with",
          "Nice venue make sure to ask for eligible discounts otherwise you pay full price, wolfs were absolutely great, howling for about five minutes, Alpenzoo cares for its animals and it's shows good family two hours out",
          "Well worth visiting if you have a spare hour or 2 and definitely visit as part of the Innsbruck card when it is free. We did it in combination with a visit to the top of the mountain and is the second stop from town on the train thing from congress in the centre of town.",
          "we had visited the third time in this lovely alpenzoo and of course enjoyed very much,lots of animals but it is not recomended for older people.",
          "Visited in Dec 2015 and it was snowing heavily..so, i guess this is not a place to visit during winter coz all the animals would not be active..",
          "The zoo is on a small scale, built on a steep mountainside and consequently the animal enclosures mirror Victotian standards",
          "Visited as part of the Innsbruck Card on the way up to the mountain, and wished we had allowed more time! The zoo was enjoyed by all members of the family young and old. You get get up close yo the animals and even step inside their enclosures. The petting area was great fun",
          "We had one day in Innsbruck only. Having read a lot of reviews we chose to visit the mountains and the zoo and didn't regret our choice. We visited a number of zoos in the past, among them the ones in Singapore, Australia, Madagascar and the US. And frankly, we loved this one as",
          "But then many of the animals were either hibernating or sheltering inside! Very small \"zoo\", featuring native animals.",
          "Very mountainous, you will need comfortable shoes and able bodied. The scenery was amazing but wouldn't recommend a rainy day as there is no shelter. Took the cable car to the zoo as this was an experience in it's self. Animals in natural settings.",
          "We had the Innsbruck card so entry was free. If you have a little time to spare its definitely worth a visit, you can take the Funicular to the Alpenzoo and then if you don't want to wait for one to go back down you can take a bus from outside the zoo which runs right back into",
          "It's a lovely small zoo located in the mountains. There are animals that can be found in the Alps - they seem happy and well cared for. You can get really close to some of the animals and birds. It's a great way to spend couple of hours. Be sure to spot the male lynx on his",
          "I've been to better zoos. I'd probably skip this one and do something different with my day in Innsbruck. That said - if you're travelling with kids, it would be great! Lots of playgrounds. The pathways are very steep though - I was exhausted walking up and I wasnt pushing a",
          "This is a nice zoo with animals that can be found in the Alps. Many cages are fairly small, but wee-laid out and good use is made the incline to give the animals as much space as possible. Easy to get to with the Nordketterbahnen. But it is on fairly steep slope so takes a bit",
          "Nice place with animals but nothing really special. They are focused on mountain animals which is nice. Anyway if you are in Innsbruck with kids than you should go there for sure",
          "great visit for all , kids + adults , very interesting , take your time and ask a lot of questions , the guides have lots of knowledge",
          "The Zoo is ok and I like the fact that they have only animals which is naturally living in this area. However the paddocks for the animals is really small and you should pack your climbing shoes because the Zoo is literally up the mountain and the road is really steep so I would",
          "Both educational and entertaining. This is a great way to spend half a day. There is a lot to see, and really something for anyage",
          "I enjoyed the alpine zoo but there were both positives and negatives about the experience. The zoo is quite a physically challenging zoo to get around, as being built into the mountain means there are a lot of steep hills. It was very hot weather when we went but I consider",
          "Living in Canada we take many of the alpine animals presented in the zoo for granted so there were no surprises here, but the facilities are excellent, well designed, with lots of habitat recreated for each animal. Lots for kids, big and small to see and enjoy. With the",
          "Even before you get there there is walking to be done. The zoo is on the side of the mountain so there is a lot of up and down walking. It's worth it though to see the different types of alpine animals, some I had only ever read about.",
          "It is a small cosy zoo that is located on the hills . You can see some wild animals like wolfs, mooses, deers..And there are some farm animals like cows, hens, goats. It's great for kids.",
          "Included in the Innsbruck card so had a look round on the way down into Innsbruck after a trip on the cable cars to the top. Nice to add variety to the day.",
          "We were walking around the city when we by chance saw the signs for this alpine zoo. What a great find it was. We highly recommend it. Prices are very affordable and you can spend all day there. The petting zoo is quite the highlight and parents can take a rest at a restaurant",
          "I'm not sure what we expected at this zoo, but overall we were rather disappointed. The highlights were the lynx and european bear but a lot of the other animals were things we see in the wild at home - osprey, pine martin, red squirrel, ravens! Nice if you're from a different",
          "The zoo can be accessed from by the river with a joint card with the railway. Great little journey with breathtaking views. You will need your walking legs as is very steep and not really aimed at our wheelchair useres. The highlight would have to be the Brown Bear. This I can",
          "Visited here on a hot day as part of the ticket deal with the cable car. It's the type of zoo I don't really like - lots of disinterested looking animals in what looked like uncomfortably small enclosures. I really didn't like the number of people banging on glass/fences to try",
          "I wasn't expecting a great deal from this zoo and was surprised on the upside. This is a serious, authentic zoo which doesn't pander (or panda!) to the lowest common denominator and instead offers a comprehensive selection of alpine fauna displayed in a way which is both",
          "I am not that interested in zoos but enjoyed this one. Great forest location with periodic views over Innsbruck",
          "When we were there, there was building work going on causing some disruption, but the end result looks like it will be worth it. The zoo is compact, built on a hillside, with generous sized cages for the animals. All looked to be happy in their environment.",
          "It is well worth visiting the Alpine Zoo if you find yourself in Innsbruck. I do not normally like zoos but I thought I would try this one as it only has alpine species and we were about to set off on a hiking holiday in the South Tyrol. It is only a 20 minute uphill walk from",
          "This zoo is unique as it is built on the mountain preserving the natural habitat of Alpine animals and birds. You can easily hike from the old town city center or golden roof with the kids. Kids would surely love this. It has a play area and an ice cream parlor to end the trip",
          "I visited on a fairly warm day and most of the animals seemed to be holed up out of the heat with the exception of the domestic (farm) animals. The alpen part of the name is accurate as there was very little flat ground lots of trudging up and down the hilly terrain of the zoo.",
          "This is probably the worst zoo we have ever visited (and we have been to zoos all over the world). It is very old-fashioned and has very few animals to see. They have tried to make something out of nothing. We felt it would be particularly disappointing for children, especially",
          "We vizit the zoo with my family in arainy day but it was amazing trip and we saw aunique animals and diffrent kind of the animals . The children spend alovely time there . I recommebded it for all. Ali almarri",
          "Kids loved the zoo seeing a different selection of animals to the English zoos highlights were probably the lynx and bears. Beautiful ... I do struggle with the concept of zoos at times but this place is very well done isn't overly commercial like some and is relatively small",
          "Pros: + many attractions and quizes for children, + many different species, but mainly birds Cons: - lack of english descriptions (german only!), - you can feel a bit squeezed because the enclosures are relatively small and near to each other, - even small children are charged",
          "The way this zoo has it's displays set up, it's very easy to be separated from some of the animals by mere inches and a really thick pane of glass. I have never been so close to a bear or wolf. You can really see the detail of their appearance and behavior, so if you like to",
          "Great family activity, especially for young families, though my teens/20-somthings enjoyed it. The zoo is cleverly built into the side of a mountain and the animal exhibits much better designed/natural than in many American zoos. If I were an animal that had to live in a zoo,",
          "Before you go to a zoo called Alpen, understand that the word means hills. It is very hilly. I found it difficult to follow the map and at times hard to see the animals. It was certainly good exercise and it does highlight animals that live in the Apls.",
          "I have been with my kids to a much bigger and nicer zoo's. Its a bit small ant not to attractive. Its very clean and easy to walk into it.",
          "Small specific zoo with lots to see from the local area. We loved the Lynx who was resting high in a tree. Good range of animals, beavers, wolves, farm animals, snakes, birds etc.",
          "My boyfriend and I went to this zoo when the weather was nice. but, I think it's also good when it's cloudy or a little rainy. Just don't go there when the weather is really bad. In this zoo you can see an amazing variety of animals which typically live in the Alps: bears,",
          "We walked through the Zoo in two hours. It is nice in combination with the Nordkettenbahn or with the Innsbruck card. The zoo is attractive and themed to Alpine animals in a natural habitat. I liked to see the golden eagle and Bardgeirs. Small but nice. Regular price is 10",
          "In good weather this place is really great, it's not too big but enough to spend most of a day. The animals all look happy and well looked after and this is free on the Innsbruck card.",
          "Its a bit of a walk from the alpenzoo station, that too a climb. In the zoo itself you have to hike to see each enclosure. There is hardly anything to so in the zoo and we have to strain our eyes to find something. We only visited because it was free with innsbruck card and",
          "The impression is not of the best. It honestly doesn't look like the animals are very well taken care of, most of them have some nervous behaviour and visibly unhealthy fur. The wolves do not seem to have enough space, the poor rain Deers would be much better of somewhere else",
          "This zoo was excellent from start to finish. I took the train up with my 10 year old son which was fun. There definitely was a lot of walking uphill and downhill, but the views were worth it. The petting zoo was the highlight of our day, and the child's playground was also",
          "The Alpenzoo is on the Nordkette line so if you are going up the mountain that way, it is an easy stop to make. It is also on the bus line. It is a relatively small zoo and contains only animals found in the Alps. This was great because we saw some of these animals in the wild",
          "This zoo was really interesting as, for the most part it is home to indigenous animals from the region. Our kids loved it and their favourite section was the farm animals enclosure. The zoo is well kept and animals appeared to be very well cared for. A word of warning-like",
          "We are currently staying in Innsbrook and just returned from the Alpenzoo. Since we had bought the Innsbrook card we could visit the zoo for no extra charge so we decided to take our 2 young children there on our way down from the Nordkettenbahnen. The zoo was small with many",
          "Innsbruck is beautiful but as such doesn't have many places of interest...so it's natural that this zoo is one of the touristy places. It's very well maintained and we had a fun time. There's a little cafe at the entrance and of course an ice cream cart (kids, zoo). Walk down",
          "Only needed 2.5 hours for the two of us to go though, but was super worth it! Amazing animals and well layed out. Make sure you wear good walking shoes as there is a lot of up hill and down hill walking",
          "Find this difficult but didn't particularly liked this zoo ... The place looked to me as run down... Needs some spirit... Then again perhaps expectations were high - city zoos can be just a tad older ....",
          "I was most disappointed to visit this zoo. It was so bad that I left after 15 minutes. I was expecting to see wild animals, but I saw beaver, harvest mouse. I did not even saw the bear!! There was a great view from the top of the mountain. That was it for me. I would not",
          "The Zoo is situated in the mountains over Innsbruck which is a perfect place for showcasing the animal life of the alps. The zoo covers pretty much all of the animal kingdom from the Alps. Birds, mammels, fish, reptiles. Alpen Zoo is placed in a elevated park which means that",
          "First don't expect a big city zoo!! I've been to San Diego Zoo..Brookfield and so on! It's not like them but it's a great zoo not just for small children! It's inexpensive and not a huge time commitment. You can get close to the animals and the staff makes an effort for them",
          "This zoo is fantastic, highly recommend it, nicely laid out up the alpine region. Yes there is a bit of walking up hill but as you go up you must go down follow the map from exhibit 1 to the end and you will be ok, wear comfortable shoes, lots of entertainment for the kids,",
          "I visited this zoo on the way upto the nordkette range. It is said to be the highest zoo in the world. But there isnt much animals here. You will find a bear, lynx, varieties of deers, elk and a few more types. I would recommend to avoid if you do not have time, unless you have",
          "I visited the Alpenzoo on my way down from the mountains, Instead of taking the Hungerburg Funicular from its highest station I walked from there to the zoo, then took the train the rest of the way back to Innsbruck. In fact if you have a half hour I'd recommend that method. I",
          "I went here with a friend who has never been to Austria. There are lots of animals however many of them seem to be hiding. That said, it is still well worth the 10 euro it currently costs, the Eagles are outstanding.",
          "I would've been greatly disappointed if I had paid to visit this rather small zoo. I realise you can't expect vast displays of animals when the location is on a hillside, and on the whole I think the exhibits were poor. I'm no expert but I am led to believe a prancing animal",
          "Great to see Alpine animals close up and the kids loved it despite the rain. Not good for people with mobility issues as it's up and downhill all the time!",
          "This was a good day out, nice little zoo in the mountains with a nice mixture of animals and birds, you can feed the pigs and the goats.",
          "The Alpenzoo is an interesting place to visit for a couple of hours. They have made a good effort to showcase various local mammals, birds, reptiles, as well as major trees. Unfortunately, the limited information available was mostly in German, so we could not fully appreciate",
          "The Wolf and Brown Bear exhibits are great. This zoo has a real petting zoo included in the admission! The children can feed the friendly animals like goats, sheep and baby piglets.",
          "It was a bit rainy so some of the animals were hiding, but the setting and gardens alone are lovely and we saw gorgeous lynx cats, bears, marmots, chamois, vultures and some other not-often-seen animals. Spent a happy 2 hours there. There is a free shuttle to and from it. Also",
          "Animals seem to be looked after well. Some cages are small for the large raptor birds. The brown bears have a good enclosure but you can't help thinking they should be free in the open to go and do what they like.",
          "Beautiful animal enclosures. Loved the brown bear exhibit. Great children's playground. Perfect for families with little children.",
          "This zoo can be reached by car, funicular, bus or a 30 min walk from the city. The admission price is expensive (10 euro per adult, 5 euro for children over 6) but there is a combi ticket which includes a return journey on the funicular for an extra 2.50 each. Once you are in,",
          "I visited the zoo twice during a 2-week stay in Innsbruck last month. I went once by funicular then back down via public bus, and the other time both ways by public bus. It's a wonderful zoo. On the first level, you'll see ducks and brown bears, then you have the option of",
          "Not a very big zoo but nevertheless I enjoyed it as there were animals here that I had never seen before so it was a good experience The highlight for me was the wolves fighting at feeding time. Was quite a spectacle straight out of a documentary Also the elk or the moose",
          "Very scenic little zoo. Spent 2 hours wandering around. The animal habitats look well-constructed to replicate the natural habitats and relatively spacious compared to another world-class zoo that comes to mind. Loved the wolves and bears and even the other animals were a",
          "The Alpen zoo is a great place for young children. Children under three are free. The main attractions are a bear, several moose, and a Austrian cow with the cutest cow bell. The views of the city below are also nice. I really enjoyed the indoor fish exhibit that has a zen",
          "The zoo is situated in the mountains. Taking the funicular to access the zoo is fun and easy. While you visit the zoo, enjoy the view of Innsbruck in its integrality. A wide range of animals, a lot of birds, and very well designed cages : entering the cages to see the animals",
          "Up the top of Innsbruck I found this gem- My Sister Moni recomended it amazing selection of animals from Bears to fish salamanders Lynx goats birds Eagles Buzzards Cows Wild pigs and great displays- went with sister and kids great day out- huge brown bear and lots wild birds",
          "Lots of interesting animals to see. The zoo is quite small but makes for a great day trip, we enjoyed very much the visit.",
          "Alpenzoo is located on the middle station of nordkettenbahn. You have to walk 1/2 KM to reach the zoo so not recommended for old people or those who need wheelchairs. Although you can travel by car also. Animals are average - bear, mongoose, few birds, petting zoo for kids, etc.",
          "Lots of great animals that I hadn't seen before including bears, elks and wolves. It was very interesting and all of the wildlife was pretty amazing.",
          "We visited the Alpenzoo again and we like this zoo every time because of the special mountain animals and the beautiful forest location. In the wintertime not all animals are visible but it is still nice to visit. We think the best time to visit is spring and summer. Easy to",
          "Went to the Zoo as part of the Innsbruck Pass. The site is quite steep being on the side of a mountain. The bearded vultures were interesting. There were 2 brown bears. One bear looked OK, but the other bear was pacing back and forth in front of the viewing window in an",
          "It was a sunny day. Was there for 2 to 3 hours and was able to see nearly everything that there was to see except one or two - the Reh were very shy this year. I seen the bear and tortoises this year. There are plenty of places to rest your legs. It's a great place to see all",
          "This a small but decent zoo, with animals living in their original habitat. We went at feeding time which meant we got to see all of the animals active. The beaver family were our groups favourite, typically beavering away building and eating carrots. It's set in the",
          "We went to the zoo with our daughter & she was very happy. We liked the way it is constructed. We could see some sea creatures we never saw before. It can be bit tiring for older people since it is on the mountain & not typical flat surfaces. But worth visiting. This not a huge",
          "Lots of interesting animals to see. Great set up and very friendly staff. We will come back for sure.",
          "Love visiting zoos and this one did not disappoint! Loved the wolves, bears and cats! Recommend a visit whilst in Innsbruck!",
          "We only went to this zoo because it was included in the Innsbruck Card. We shouldn't have bothered. There wasn't much there and the bear looked so unhappy, pacing around in circles, that we left.",
          "We visited for free with the Innsbruck card In that regard, it was fine. I'd be sad though, if I paid entry. Not a lot of animals out in winter. The brown bear was a great highlight though Most of this is done on foot so you need to be fairly able bodied",
          "Small zoo in Innsbruck that can be toured within ~two hours. It takes ~30 min to walk to it from the centre (Golden Roof area) and while the walk is a bit steep towards the end it is a good stroll. Some animals were hibernating in early March but it still was worth seeing the",
          "Because the zoo is located on the side of the mountain you get a nice view over Innsbruck. Lots of animals and big enough to spend at least 1,5 hours.",
          "We saw almost all the animals, if they were not in winter hibernation (because it was February). Stroller-friendly but it does go up and down hills, as it is on the side of the mountain. Dress warmly for the weather. We spent about 2 hours seeing all of the exhibits.",
          "We loved our day in the Alpenzoo. To me, was a bit expensive but we really enjoyed the Alpenzoo and thought it was worth visiting! I really like animals and usually I don't like zoos but this one was different and the animals seemed relaxed. I'll be visiting again!",
          "this is surely a lovely place but we visited in December (due to lack of snow and mountain lifts closed due to technical failures) and there were not a whole lot of animals around. A lot were hiding for their winter-sleep; It's quite and uphill/downhill hike, not ideal with",
          "Loads of different alpine animals, some interactive stuff and a great play/adventure park. Food and drink decent and resonable-priced too.",
          "The trip is worth the visit if in the area. I expect kids would love it. We were 4 adults and we enjoyed it. We didnt spend much time there and stopped off on way down from mountain. Probably wouldnt make a special trip just for that.",
          "We had the Innsbruck card and since it was included we decided to stop at the zoo on our way back down from Nordkettenbahnen. We had about a half hour before our next plan and figured it was a little place we could just walk around and see the sleeping mountain goat and a hawk",
          "It is absolutely worth a visit on a great summer day. There is a nice selection of animals to see and big playground for kids near a cafe. It is worth knowing that right now in winter many animals are in winter sleep and are not available for veiwing.",
          "Lovely little zoo containing animals only local to the area. We visited on a very cold snowy day after taking the train up and walking down. The views over Innsbruck were stunning. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited this place in a rainy/snowy day in January. This is a relativelly small zoo but well organised, quite easy to get around. Some of the animals were hibernating or hiding due to the weather so I think choosing the season wisely would make a difference. They have a small",
          "It's hard to know where to start with this one! Maybe at this point - it is really not worth going to this 'zoo'. For one thing, most of it is made up of birds, many of which you would probably find in the wild if you took a short walk around the area. A raven really has no",
          "Nice.Not that big.2 hours are enough to take a visit.You will have the idea of all the animals living in the alpes area.Good bar as well",
          "I visited the zoo with my boyfriend for a break from drinking mulled wine and Christmas shopping. We walked to the zoo from our hotel but you can get the train. It cost about 10 euros for both of us which we thought was quite reasonable. A large number of the animals were farm",
          "We went early on a December morning. We walked down from our hotel but the zoo can be reached by Hungerbergbahn or bus. It's nice to see which species are living in the Alps. The are situated in a large garden with many cages you can enter in order to come close to them. After a",
          "This is a good stop on the way up Nordkette. It a has a good range of animals and you can easily spend 2-3 hours here.",
          "What a fun morning or afternoon diversion! You can get surprisingly close to some animals (like the Steinbock). Has a petting zoo area. Everything is very clean. Lots of hiking up and down so probably not too great for kids in strollers but fine for older kids and adults.",
          "Went here expecting it to be small or medium sized but turned out to be better. There were many habitats, habitats that were nice and comfortable for their resident animals. There was a large variety of alpine animals and some very interesting ones like the lynx and the two",
          "This zoo is reachable by car, but even so by the Nordkettenbahn, what is an attraction on itself. The zoo is very well kept, with lots of possibilities to see animals from very nearby, in their own habitat. Even if the area is somehow limited by the steep mountainside location,",
          "Kept very clean but nothing exciting to see unless you are a very small child.I felt very sorry for the bear stuck on its own.Will say the food was very good for a little snack place...",
          "Smallish zoo but which involves a fair bit of wandering up and down. Local species are kept in varying size enclosures which try to replicate the animals' natural habitat. I'm not a fan of zoos and don't believe certain animals - like bears and wolves - should not be kept",
          "The Alpine Zoo, the highest zoo in Europe is on the first stop of the Nordkettenbahnen funicular in Hungerburg and is free with the Innsbruck card. When I visited in December a lot of animals appeared (or not) to be hidden away in their warmer boroughs etc... and of the bigger",
          "This is well worth a visit if you're in innsbruck for a few days. It's home to alpine animals and they have a vast array of creatures ranging from wolves and bears to mountain goats and Eagles. There is lots to do and see, it's great for families and also has a cafe and large",
          "We went to the zoo on our \"Innsbruck Card\". December is NOT a good time to visit the zoo, as most of the animals are asleep or hiding. We saw NO snakes as they were sleeping under rocks. Not many birds around. The aquarium section was poor. The situation of the zoo and its",
          "My husband and I stopped off at the Alpine zoo on the way down from the mountains. One of the best Zoo's I have been too in a long time. In fact it didn't really feel like a zoo. All the animals had great enclosures. Our favourite were the Mountain Goats, they are so agile. Saw",
          "We took the funicular up to the zoo with a double stroller and two young kids. We couldn't see the beaver or the otter, however we saw everything else. I agree with other reviews, two hours is enough time to see everything and not rush.",
          "We visited here whilst in Innsbruck for the Christmas markets, it cost \u20ac38 which included the cable car ride up to it, brilliant zoo with some different animals to your normal zoo. Beware there is a lot of uphill walking involved but great day out.",
          "Day tour to Innsbruck. We did the Combo ticket with the zoo and hungerburg via the funicular. The weather was cool (just over 50F) with some rain but we still spent more than an hour walking the trails. There are enough indoor stops to stay warm and dry. Beautiful wolves, big",
          "We bought a 24hour innsbruck card for \u20ac33 and decided to really take advantage of the cable car included in it.on our way down from the top we stopped at the alpenzoo. Its free to enter with the innsbruck card or \u20ac10 per adult otherwise. The zoo is a good size and there are some",
          "Included in the Innsbruck card, entry to the Alpenzoo is something you do if you have the time on your way up to or down from the pristine heights. Remember, it is dedicated to alpine critters only. But you can always be sure it'll be a hit with 'die kinder'.",
          "I was there with my four year old daughter and it was one of the best zoo experiences I have had in 40 year. The exhibits where so well designed and for some reason most of the animals we wanted to see were very active. Strongly recommended trip.",
          "We were brave and walked from the center of town up to the zoo but never mind that. The zoo was bigger than expected and lots of animals. It was a fun couple activity but as with any zoo it's also great for kids as you can feed the sheep and goats. The admission is cheap too for",
          "Wonderful special animals: funny and scary sometimes! The tour can be long a pair hours. The two bears are gorgeous and the birds are something very stunning. Standing ovation \ud83d\udc4f",
          "I have visited here twice on the Innsbruck card . The zoo itself is on different levels as you walk in , so reading the map is a good idea , to know what you want to see and where you want to see it . It has a most fantastic indoor aquarium which is perfect for showery weather",
          "Not the largest zoo but not bad especially it had a good collection of animals from Austria and the mountains. I took a group of teens and they enjoyed it.",
          "This zoo was great. It has a unique assortment of animals that are easily able to be seen. It's a fun activity to do as you make your way up or down the mountain.",
          "the zoo is quite good with some unique alpine animals . I spent nearly 2 hours yet i am not a kid . It is suitable for both grownup and kids",
          "We went up to the zoo with the Hungerbahn, but it is still a little walk to the zoo entrance. The layout of the zoo along a hill will want you to wear sturdy shoes, lots of steep parts and tight hair pin curves. Maybe not that easy to maneuver with a stroller or if you have",
          "A small zoo showing European fauna. Good modern cages. The fresh water aquarium is also worth seeing. It is not called the Alpenzoo for nothing though, be prepared for some steep climbs from top to bottom.",
          "The Alpenzoo is a fun way to spend a couple of hours especially if you like animals. The animals here can all be found in the alpine region. Good cafe as well. Easily reached by bus or the Nordkettenbahn.",
          "Great zoo with some beautiful animals. Just be prepared to walk a lot on quite steep hillside. Animals are all unique to alpine environments.",
          "We took the monorail thing to go up. Good for kids, our baby was just 10months old but enjoyed seeing the grisly bear from the viewing cave. Can spend the whole day there with restaurant and playground for kids.",
          "The Alpenzoo offers a wonderful opportunity to see some of the animals that are native to the Alps of Austria. It's easy to get to using the funicular and it will provide you with a couple of hours of entertainment. Taking the funicular will also provide you with great views",
          "We enjoyed very much the visit. The location, the way the animals are kept and the feel of been in the nature, made the visit very pleasant. You feel that they respect the animals and the zoo is in harmony with the nature. It is integrated in the mountain. We believe it is an",
          "My husband and I visited on Sunday, Sept. 13, 2015. We thoroughly enjoyed it! Yes, there is a lot of uphill walking, but the zoo is so pleasant, and the views of Innsbruck while meandering upward are fantastic!",
          "We were excited about their marmots, but it didn\u00b4t show this day. The birds were more into this tourist thing. i\u00b4m impressed by all of them.",
          "Not been to the zoo for 20 years but enjoyed it as much as the first time. The alpine animals seem well cared for and it is well laid out albeit hilly. No problem for me but you will need an element of fitness. As part of the Innsbruck card which includes transport to it, I",
          "A great selection of different alpine animals. The zoo is quite small but makes for a great day trip if you take the funicular up to the top of the mountain as well.",
          "Very good zoo with animals only found in the Alps like ibex, chamois, lynx and bears. Animals look well cared for. Lots of uphill walking! but great views over Innsbruck. Playground and cafe at end. Get bus W from Marktplatz",
          "Half way up the mountain the position of this zoo is spectacular. It was a rather hot day and it was good to see there was plenty of outside shade for the animals. Really liked the Wolves.",
          "What to say other than it's a zoo with a nice array of animals. Clean and well maintained, the holding pens seem large enough allthough I don't know anything about that ^^. Especially loved the terrarium & aviaria. Easy to go to on your way to the Nordkette & definitely worth",
          "We are two couples and we went to the zoo today. it was beautiful. the exhibits of the alpine lake fish was breathtaking. And the ibex and chamois enclosures were beautiful and very natural. we spent at least 3 hours in the zoo and were impressed with the care and thought",
          "Despite the ads, the alpine zoo is not so big. And most of the larger animals ( the bears, the wolves ) were clearly bored. For 5 min the large brown bear did nothing else but patrol its pool from one side to the other, much like a prisoner in a small cell. It was really",
          "The zoo, which is accessible by mass transit, is very well laid out in terms of walking and seeing the animals without having to double back. We were able to buy combined tram and zoo tickets at the tram stop, which were very reasonable. The zoo's residents are all animals",
          "We had trouble finding our way to the zoo but were glad when we finally did. The location of the zoo is unique, high up the mountain and the steep pathways and great views add to this feeling. Entrance fee was 10 euro, which we thought was a good price. We got to see a few",
          "The zoo is built on a steep hillside and can be hard going if you're not reasonably fit. They have tried really hard to give the animals decent habitats so they are sometimes hard to see. Personally I would rather that the animals needs were met before the humans so I didn't",
          "If you are sportpeople, not necessary to catch the funicular train. Do not go at 10-11 am the animals sleep !!! and you see nothing. We have been a small desappointed We prefer the Zoo of BEAUVAL in France. Sorry",
          "Very hot walk in summer. Very hilly. Nice enough but I would skip it if I had anything else to do. Heard the wolves howled at noon but they didn't",
          "Worth a stop on the way back from the nordketten. U won't be seeing any big/ wild animals but it's a nice zoo in the mountains. Do to forget to get your trainers/ walking shoes.. There is a lot of walking to do and it is huge.",
          "We stopped through here on our way back down from the cable car trip. The zoo was very nice, lots of exhibits. We didn't get to appreciate it fully as our children were already tired from the trip up the mountain and it was a hot day, so we skipped though some parts. The brown",
          "this has all wildlife that has been in the area-very interesting and well laid out above Innsbruck. Rightly popular with adults and children>the one concern was a single brown bear that seemed to have gone mad pacing up and down in the same way as if in distress. Really did not",
          "Up in the Alpine mountains, great views and loads to see. Wolfs and lions and local animals unique to Tirol. Not a massive zoo but worth a visit. Bring the kids",
          "I planned the entire stay in Innsbruck for my boyfriend and myself. I myself am from Germany and have come to Innsbruck many times. For me it was a fixed plan to come to the zoo. This was my second time there, the first time visiting when I was ~12. I enjoyed it and my boyfriend",
          "We took the funicular to the stop Alpenzoo thinking it would be right by the entrance. However, there was quite a long uphill walk to reach it whereas, if we had known in advance, we would have got te bus W which stops right outside and runs from the market place in Innsbruck.",
          "You can get here by bus or by taking the nordketten train. It is still a bit of a walk uphill if you take the latter option. Furthermore, the whole zoo requires quite some effort, walking uphill! Not suited for buggies or elderly people. Few animals, not enough explanations",
          "I really could give this a 5 except that the signage is terrible and we got caught moving circularly ... which here means a lot of up-steep-hill down-steep-hill. The funicular makes fairly easy access -- close for those without a car, but it is still a sizeable up-hill walk",
          "Included in cost of Innsbruck card but combi ticket also available to include cost of funicular from the city centre. Lots of animals. It goes quite a long way up the hillside but is mainly pushchair friendly. I saw lots of young families during our visit. Opportunities to have",
          "I was in many zoos. But this Zoo made so realistic, so... you really start to think, that you are in the Tyrolean forest between the animals who live there... Amazing place! I advice to visit it for all!",
          "It was very interesting to see the animals we have many of the same species i Norway in the wildernes. The only animal that seem to suffer was the elk, King of the forest. He was very skinny, needs more space and food.",
          "It was hot summer, and the collection is very ordinary. We thought we would see such special collection, as it was in alpine area, turn out they were only cow,chicken,pig and some birds. Most cages were empty or the animal were not visible to see. Such a waste of time.",
          "If you bought an Innsbruck card, you can go there, but there is not a place which somebody really need to visit,",
          "The cages seemed cramped with dried up tree branchesand the standing water looked gross for the poor animals to swim in.....rather depressing.",
          "It's a small zoo but nice. The most animals was hiding for us. It's goes up and down and you have sometimes a nice view over Innsbruck . If you have kids and they are older that's fine but to go these ways with a buggy it can be difficult in some parts.",
          "Some unusual animals including the fantastic European Lynx plus domestic animals. Be warned, the paths around the zoo are very steep in places!",
          "You can reach the Alpenzoo with the Hungerburgbahn from the Congress. Exit the second stop. I liked it very much as a park. My family enjoyed it less, I am not sure why. They're used to a lot of big animals, I guess, and this zoo had many birds and frogs, fish etc. Some of the",
          "The alpenzoo was a very nice excursion from Innsbruck city center. The zoo is small but displays a wide variety of animals originally living in the Alps such as otters, all kind of birds, wold cats and even moose. The zoo is well done and always has a small plaque next to the",
          "Alpenzoo is a small zoo, with a lot of surprises. From the beautiful setting to the amazing animals this is a day out that won't be forgotten. Be sure to check out the Innsbruck card you'll get access to the zoo included.",
          "We came to see a bear and we were not disappointed, he is beautiful and has a nice enclosure, because of the panoramic glass window, my husband got some fantastic photo's and films that make the bear look like he was sitting alongside me. The wolves were lovely as were the lynx.",
          "This a small zoo that focuses on local animals. It's not large but it is laid out well and if you follow the map and visit the exhibits in order you'll get a good view of the whole site. The bears are supposed to be the biggest draws and they were actively wandering around and",
          "We visited as we had just done the cable car excursion and the zoo was included in our 'Innsbruck zoo'. The zoo just included animals and birds that are from an alpine environment. The zoo is small, dated, a little boring to be honest. But the kids running around were smiling",
          "We visited the zoo with our little girl she was happy to l View all kind of animals in there.we like the zoo verymuch",
          "The zoo surely has a good display of animals, and worth stopping by for an hour or so. However the cages / display areas are not very well organised, and it takes a bit of back and forth to realise the way around.",
          "We stopped on the way back from the top, arriving via the funicular. We went specifically to see the brown bears which are in a very good enclosure and very cool. We also had a quick walk around the rest, and we enjoyed the moose also. A bit of walking involved but the zoo",
          "My husband and I visited the zoo for a few hours on a cold and drizzly day in Innsbruck. It costs \u20ac10 to get in, however it's free if you have an Innsbruck Card, which also offers one free return trip on the funicular train up the mountainside. There are quite a few different",
          "alpenzoo is really nice place to be visited, especially with children. be prepared to spend at least two hours in it.",
          "The zoo is nice, though a lot of the animals were nowhere to be seen. Specially in good weather it's worth the trip, because of the nice setting and view!",
          "This was a unique zoo, as it has all the alpine wildlife that you find in the alps! kids really enjoy it...not much for adults ..but its still okay to go once in your life",
          "We decided to visit the zoo after a trip on the cable car to Hungerburg. We paid \u20ac10 each to get in, but it can be considerably cheeper combining admission with the cable car fare (so worth planning ahead). The zoo is very clean and well organised although it requires a lot of",
          "There are about 30 areas with animals including a small feeding station with goats, cows, pigs, etc.... My kids loved the Bear exhibit as well as the Beaver.",
          "Good choice for short break in your winter skiing holidays. Not far away from Arena Zillertal area. We've visit it in January. Despite weather conditions all animals were very active and attractive for our 6 years old son. Very cognitive, creative and clear feed for children.",
          "Wonderful zoo, great animal experience. Well worth the visit especially with Innsbruck card as its free.",
          "We visited the zoo twice during our stay in Innsbruck as my sons love the animals (and entrance was free with the Innsbruck cards!) Highlight was the bear, which wasn't there when we visited the zoo a few years ago. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Must see for any trip to Innsbruck. Great variety of local alpine animals. Well kept and spacious enclosures. Great for a family trip or activity to spend half a day on with wonderful views of both animals and mountains at every stop.",
          "we spent a great summers afternoon at the Alpen Zoo. The kids loved the mountain goats, eagles, owl and the bears. The poor moose looked depressed and bears continuously pace back and forward which is a bit sad. The kids playground at the end is amazing! Make sure you check out",
          "I was contemplating a moment if this a three of four star attraction. I decided it's three. Good thing is that it's not too large for smaller children and there are big, easily spottable animals. Especially the romestic animals with the feeding possibility is a spot on for kids.",
          "We stopped on the funicular at the Zoo. It was a good place to see so many animals. It was snowy and slushy under foot, but the animals were used to this sort of weather. It was not crowded and we could move around easily. A good place to visit, we enjoyed it.",
          "Nice zoo and worth a visit if you are in Innsbruck and plan to go up to Hafelekar. The entry is free to the zoo if you have taken the Innsbruck Day card which also allows you access to public transport and the cable car and train. You might want to visit the zoo before the",
          "I didn't have high expectations because I though how many animals will be out and about in the cold during December. But we were pleasantly surprised as we did manage to see quite a lot of animals. There were otters, wolves, mountain goats, moose (or perhaps they were elks?),",
          "This was such a wonderful place to see. Even though it was snowing and freezing cold these wonders of nature still came out and wondered about. The bear had such a character as did the cats, and the wolf, and all the animals I felt lucky to see. A great day",
          "This place isn't really like other zoos I have visited, because It only has animals from the local area, so alpine animals like otters, beavers, elk, lynx, wolves, vultures etc. This gives it an authentic feel. The zoo is laid out up the hillside, and is perhaps not suitable for",
          "First stop on thev full dayvout up the Hafelkar using our innsbruck cardson New Years Day. Only 6 other visitors over a 2 hour period from 9am. Bears, wolves, eagles active and in the snow a lovely sight.",
          "Very nice zoo with animals coming from the Alpes! No rhino, no hippo, .... only from the Alpes and it is a very nice idea",
          "Really enjoyed this trip - lovely little attraction in the mountains ... Loads of alpine animals! Very impressed! Would highly recommend!",
          "This is a great zoo in the heart of the alps. You can easily reach it by hiking from the city center, or more conveniently use the bus W or the Hungerburg cable car. You also can go there by car and pay a parking fee, but I prefer walking, as it is a good climb, which basically",
          "Dropped in to Alpenzoo in October 2014. This time is considered the off-season so for while my partner and I were the only people in the zoo! It wasn't until we were almost finished that we saw another person. It was great! If you buy the Innsbruck card (which I highly",
          "A nicely presented zoo, with interesting habitats and animals that aren't your normal zoo fare. Focusing totally on native Alpine animals dovetails nicely with the location. Beware, though: the zoo is built on the side of the mountain and requires a lot of walking up and down",
          "Not such a surprise of course, zoos are always sad, but there was a bear and it they did was nervously run around its cage, and bang on walls, and that's just depressing and awful... The zoo isn't bad, cages are ok, the location is on the mountains and it does give a resemblance",
          "This was so much better than I thought it would be. It was an easy tour and the animals were great! We really enjoyed ourselves. :)",
          "The animals are indigenous and the environment really works to showcase the animals. It is also fun - with spielplatz etc.",
          "The kids gave this a 5 and us adults gave it a 3, and thus the average to a 4 rating. Having been to the great zoos in San Diego there really is no comparison. However, it is a great activity to do with kids and ours loved the break from regular sightseeing. It really should",

          "Hilly little zoo but adorable for children maybe harder with a pram. \nSummer time the animals are hiding from the hot temperatures so over two hours we sadly only saw sleeping animals or birds.",
          "Really good views and amazingopen  bird voliers.",
          "Nice zoo, with a great view over Innsbruck. \nPrice-perfomance is good.",
          "A great find. Has Alpine (only) animals in well thought out enclosures. Looks like it's just been refurbished. I was put off by other reviews, so nearly didn't come, but I'm glad I did!\n\nYou wind your way up and then down the mountainside, \u2026",
          "Good for children to learn about animals.... walking around can be difficult due to the undulating terrain",
          "Very little English, would of enjoyed it knowing what we were looking at and the facts.",
          "The zoo is very interesting with the way of visiting that is not obvious. There are some interesting animals and other stuff to see. You need 2-3 hours to have time to see everything. We were surprised that there was no English descriptions just german. This is something that they have to work on especially these days.",
          "One of the most beautiful views a zoo could ever offer to it's visitors. It has a lot of animals restricted in highly modernized areas. The tour route is quite short but you have to be in a well condition if you would visit it during the \u2026",
          "Facilities look amazing and well maintained. There are lots of local animals. A clear description of the animals and their behavior. A bit sad is the look of predatory animals like a lynx in a small enclosed cage, which unfortunately comes \u2026",
          "Fantastic view, beautiful enclosures, very detailed interior installations. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Amazining zoo with Alpine animals (no tigers and such). Animal welfare seems good, the cages are large and often have a very creative design. All for a low price.",
          "Small but nice.  Kids liked the aquarium and feeding goats & sheep.  Saw the wolves howling from just meters away.  And, of course, lovely mountain views.",
          "Loved it but be prepared all uphill and some are fairly steep",
          "It's nice that it let you in to some bird cage. Will need a little bit hiking when visiting animals, because it's in the mountain area.",
          "I had trouble navigating the Zoo - I frequently ended up in deadlocks when I expected to get to the next attraction. I didn't have enough time to see everything and wanted to see certain animals and go there directly, which is impossible \u2026",
          "Excellent zoo of Alpine wildlife including beavers and lynxes. Some patience needed to spot the animals, and a good walk up the hillside.",
          "Amazing animals, very informative, nice place in the nature",
          "Parking is an issue. Our Parking lot missed a sign that there was a meter machine, lower down the street. We got a E$ 25,- fine",
          "Sumsi Tag at the alpine zoo was once again great for the kids. Free sweets everywhere, apple juice and honey bread. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Small and cosy zoo! you can get close to the animals, we liked it!\nfor sure we will be back to visit the Lynx another visit.",
          "I liked it a lot. Liked the walking up and down instead of other layouts of just flat land. So u could see animals from below and above. There sleeping habitat was really good coz u could see then right behind the glass. \n\nEnclosures were \u2026",
          "Too many birds. But saw a moose so overall pretty good",
          "I don't want to complain but it wasn't so great as i imagined it to be. The facilities are GREAT but there wasn't a big amount of animals and most of them never appeared",
          "I expected a bit larger quarters for the animals, nice views from the zoo and some unique local animals, but not markedly better than other small zoos.",
          "Total Cool",
          "Nice zoo, focussing on the animals of the Alpine area.",
          "Well, we were very late in reaching the zoo.\nHad hardly 20 mins before the zoo closed at 6 pm. So, unable to comment.\nHad a look at the brochure. It must be good",
          "Nice Zoo concept - maybe in Summer the Zoo visit is more recommendable because many animals were hidden. The relaxation seats in the Aquarium Area were a great idea! Good for kids",
          "Im not that interested in the zoo, but I think children would find this place fun. There is much to see and to do for theme and that  what's counts!",
          "Visited here as we were passing and we were intrigued by what animals they could have. Was a great time with amazing views away from the zoo. I always feel a bit sorry for the animals in these places and this is the first zoo I've visited \u2026",
          "Nice small wildlife park. Mostly local animals. Enjoyable for smaller kids.",
          "Nice zoo with alot of local animals. They like to hide though. Sometimrs they only have one of a kind that hides. But its still a nice visit",
          "Fantastic zoo offering a unique experience I have not seen many other places! \n\nEasily accessible via a taxi or bus service. \n\nAnimals adapted to winter and cold conditions for the time of year, with decent enclosures for viewing, as well \u2026",
          "Definitely worth seeing!",
          "Very small zoo, hardly any animals. Only one or two things worth seeing. Not worth your money or time.",
          "Animals birds,  pleasant afternoon, reasonable price",
          "Different place to tour, worth spending time at Zoo & nearby Village. Nice travel experience in train. Stations with latest technology.",
          "Really liked seeing the bear and the wolves. Animals look well looked after.",
          "I understand that the zoo is only about Alpen animals, but for the price I would expect at least a better explanation even in English and much more signs of I am supposed to see that is pretty much hidden instead! To not repeat",
          "1. Very steep, difficult to walk around on a hot day. There's no vehicular assistance of any sort.\n2. The animals are difficult to spot. And upon that they have plastic fakes of the animal your expect to see in the corresponding area. I \u2026",
          "Excellent place to visit! You learn about all the animals that live in the alpine region. Wait until you see the size of the ravens!! Quite a few of the interactive exhibits were broken or not functioning. Be forewarned that there is a lot \u2026",
          "Such a great place to visit. We were expecting to be a little underwhelmed as we live near a safari park and have visited many large zoos. But it was brilliant, our children, who are 4 and 6 had a great day - we spent 5 hours here, and we \u2026",
          "Not that many animals that we could see they were either hiding or hibernating , bears were great. Signage could be a bit better. We walked for a long time before finding the zoo after purchasing our tickets.  We followed the signs which said 20 minutes more like 40 minutes.",
          "Worth taking the kids. Beautiful gardens. Amazing view of Innsbruck. The food from the a restaurant was great and decent value.",
          "Very nice place to visit",
          "As a zoo at highest altitude but the number animals are less, also make sure you are not visiting on a rainy day....",
          "Very good for Family and Kids , good place to show the variety of the Alpine Animal Species , they got good food and there are a lot of Cool Souvenirs aswell, if u come to innsbruck this right here is a must stop by, \ud83e\udd18",
          "Very very good Place",
          "Small zoo but good value for money, loved seeing the wildcats, mountain lynx and brown bear",
          "I just stopped here on the way down from the mountain. Was cool but if you\u2019ve been to other zoos before, it can be slightly boring. Neat designed zoo though.",
          "itnis more like educational place for kids rather than real Zoo.amazing location",
          "Great place for families and nature lovers! Is is an \u201cAllen\u201d zoo, so the animals are mountain\u2019s and alpen\u2019s, not the thypical lion or tiger!",
          "Very nice zoo. Takes about 2-3 hours to visit in full.",
          "Wonderful Zoo! Well set out, great facilities for families. Lovely cafe and stunning views all around. Amazing!",
          "Pretty run down, and not a ton of animals.",
          "A cute zoo at the foot of the mountain with an amazing view of Innsbruck. It has only alpine animals but the installations are quite pretty. It's small and visiting it doesn't take up a lot of time. The animals seem to be well fed.There \u2026",
          "Super cool zoo. Very clean and many of the animals were easy to see. It's a zoo on the side of the hill!",
          "Gives natural zoo feel. Though not a lot of rare animals but really liked the concept.",
          "Far too few animals but that may have been due to the time of the day we got there. Fed the animals must have had been resting, hidden away from view. Still the lovely views of Innsbruck more than made up for the disappointed of not seeing many animals.  Still a very lovely family outing.",
          "Love the initiative with helping the animals to go back to the wilderness when the struggle. Like the big birds that you breed to go back to nature",
          "Interesting place to go with kids. The visit doesn't take too long, which is nice.",
          "Great zoo. Be ready to walk.",
          "Nothing to see there most of the animals are not in the view and  the place is located in the mountain which made it very difficult to take a good tour",
          "Good to know the original species of the Alps.",
          "Disappointed. Most of the cages were empty. Most of people were looking, trying to search if there are any animals. We only could see Deers, Ibex, moose and after three rounds of searchingand wwaiting the bear \ud83d\udc3b. Very high price vs what's on offer. If you have too much time to waste,then it's okay.",
          "A lot of animals are MIA during winter, but we managed to catch the wolf. Awesome zoo nonetheless!\n\nThe restaurant there was exceptional.",
          "Fine zoo with a lot of animals which are living in surrounded areas.",
          "Not really that many animals to see but the novelty of having to walk up and down steep paths to get to the exhibits can be fun. If you have young children, the play area looked like they might enjoy it. If you have to push them around in a \u2026",
          "Many different animals to see.  A very nice zoo.",
          "Zoo is nice but the animals have little to no space to roam. The bear and the wolf have small enclosures. For such large, migratory animals they either should not be here or have large enclosures. Most other animals were hibernating as it \u2026",
          "We paid the zoo a visit in late November, it is an interesting zoo with only alpine animals. One can get inside the birds and chamois\u2019 cages, watching the aquarium from long chairs is great.",
          "Small but nice Zoo with a nice little playground for kids",
          "Wonderful way to meet Alpine ecology!",
          "Modest zoo, but it has it's pluses. The best part was seeing the bears really close.",
          "great zoo. and a very nice place",
          "Nice place to view",
          "Not so good zoo. Very few animals are there. Veina zoo is better.",
          "Yea its cool havent been there in 3 years but whatever",
          "Maybe the best zoo I have been to. Animals live in a palace. The buildings are beautiful and the animals are very clean and look happy. A small pub on the top of the hill has beers and other local drinks and food. There is a fancy cafe  near the entrance, very popular.",
          "Not a very big zoo but Nice spot to take your children to.",
          "Always a pleasure to return to. Having lived in Innsbruck for several years, this might be mi favourite place to show to friends when in town. The zoo offers great entertainment and panoramas and can be easily reached by public transit, by \u2026",
          "Very clear routes to follow the map from 1 to 29 interesting animals. Worth to spend 2 hours on the way",
          "very good .. we really loved the brown bear ... we had food in the cafe just above the entrance .. really nice",
          "Fun way to spend half a day. All the animals are super cool. There's a surprising amount of birds, fish and snakes. There are some steep-ish paths throughout the zoo. As mentioned, great views of Innsbruck.",
          "A zoo amidst the natural Alpine habitat. The Funicular ride to the Alpanezoo Bahn is unique and picturesque. A must see tourist destination for folks visiting Innsbruck.",
          "Must see especially for us people in tropical region.  We will otherwise rarely see these beautiful  creatures.  You get a map at the entrance for navigation. It is quite a walk up and down different levels, but worth the trouble.",
          "Waste of time",
          "Love it. Great place.",
          "Much bigger and varied Zoo than I thought from the description on their website and the price of entry. Great variety of Alpine(and other) creatures. Well worth an explore",
          "The animals are housed in small enclosures with lots of vegetation. They have good keepers, keeping up their wellbeing. I didn't see much enrichment but the habitats are rich. The variety is good. Some of the smaller birds were stressed \u2026",
          "Dropped into the Zoo on the way down from Nordkette late in the afternoon in mid December. Had a bit of trouble finding the zoo as the signs weren't very informative at the Chairlift base. It was quite a bit further to walk than we expected \u2026",
          "Great little zoo for an afternoon",
          "Exceeded my expectations. Lots of varied animals, I spent a couple of hours just exploring :) Highly recommend!",
          "Beautiful zoo to spend an afternoon",
          "Great zoo with a lot of information!",
          "Wonderful place to spend half a day with three kids.",
          "Lots to see. A very different range to your standard zoo animals. We were very lucky with the season. Lots of juvenile animals, including incredibly cute lynx.",
          "It's lovely place if you want to spend great Time with family.",
          "Great zoo, much bigger than expected. Only alpine animals (even if the definition is stretched a little in a few cases!) but that makes it more interesting as a tourist destination than a generic zoo the same the world over.",
          "Very nice area to spend time with children. Every animals are shown in their natural environment. We recommend Zoo visit to alternate museum and cultural topics with kids.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit, animals have enough space",
          "Lots of walking as it's on a hill. Some nice animals to see. Worth the trip for a nice walk and the tram car ride.",
          "Almost no animals in the Zoo. It should be free to enter but it\u2019s not 12\u20ac. Sad I drove all the way to Innsbruck for this.",
          "Good zoo with great animals however alot to walk at an incline",
          "Terrible, just few animal and that's it. Not worth it at all.",
          "The zoo are good. Its just that i am not a zoo fan so for me its just ok.",
          "It just so beautiful",
          "Great place but I would say the bears need more care and attention.",
          "Walking in this zoo is like hiking)) but i loved it. Animals seem to have adequate space in their enclosures. It would have been better if they had information on sign boards in English as well. We had lunch at restaurant there and it was decent.",
          "Decent range of animals, got to see most of them. Had a reasonable lunch in the cafe too. Only took us a few hours to go round the whole zoo, it's not massive. Worth a visit if you're around the area.",
          "It was a pleasure strolling around the hill.",
          "Excellent way to spend a few hours",
          "The most fun about the zoo is the trip towards it, when using the Hungerburgbahn. The zoo itself is not very exciting.",
          "It's a very nice zoo with local animals",
          "I would recommend not to visit the zoo during winter as most of the animals are hibernating. I visited this zoo on 31 December and it was pretty cold so not many animals were there. It's a great place for kids to learn though but most of the information about animals/birds is written in Deutsch.",
          "Well maintained Zoo.. worth a visit with the little ones..",
          "I have grown less interested and distressed by zoos in general and this is one of the poorer examples with small living enclosures,  some animals seemingly on their own. \n\nHowever even without my own reservations about animal welfare, this is poorly presented very uninformative and quite amateurish.",
          "We loved the zoo. You need to have 2-3 hours to visit    the whole place. Wolf is the top attraction. Besides, the zoo shop has amazing soft toys to buy as a souvenir!",
          "Not to big but very beautiful parc",
          "Selection of animals is okay. The price is not. I don't understand what the money from the entrance fee goes toward? This zoo needs a serious makeover and some TLC. Much nicer zoos in close by areas in Austria and Germany.",
          "Animals were kept in good conditions",
          "Better have your hiking boots on for this place. You end up climbing quite a way. The bears are one of the biggest draws but the cute lynx cubs were the cutest.",
          "Sweet little zoo with local animals. Worth a visit if you're in Innsbruck for a couple of days and are looking for entertainment. Can be done within 2-3 h slow wandering.",
          "In the heat of a summer's day, most of the animals remained hidden but we were able to see the lynx, bears and elk. We took advantage of the combined cable car and zoo ticket which also gave us free parking in the underground car park near the cable car base station, which is also close to the old town.",
          "Very few animals but kids enjoyed a lot",
          "Lovely zoo",
          "Signage could be clearer but it was a great day out we spent maybe 3 hours here and ate at the restaurant. Good trip and would recommend",
          "It's a nice experience with Kids must visit. Check timings before Visit. Would need minimum 2-3 hours to complete visit. Zoo could be maintained better.",
          "Really beautiful zoo. The focus is on local animals what is really nice. I only feel sorry for so many birds kept in cages...",
          "Great spot on Europen Alpes wildlife",
          "Nice place CE for family specially for kids",
          "I went to the Zoo with a friend.\nThe cages are too small, the animals are often hidden and when we are able to see them, they don't look fit and healthy. The brown bears look miserable.\nI don't recommend this zoo.\nHowever, the workers are nice.",
          "Amazing place.  Loved seeing reculsive alpine animals.  Birds the highlight for me including Lammergeier, black woodpecker and wryneck",
          "First thing I have visited in the month of Jan, Maybe in Summer it's a great place where we can see many animals..",
          "Small but nonetheless has a big number of animals. Situated at the base of a mountain. Has all sorts of interactive displays to engage kids and their parents.",
          "It's a small zoo but with some good exhibits - my favorites were the wolves, various birds and the lynx(es?). Do note that, if you're not exactly in shape, it is a fair bit of walking uphill and downhill within the zoo to see all the exhibits.",
          "A pretty good small-to-medium sized zoo with good exhibits of interesting alpine animals. However it would have been a lot more interesting for me if the animal information signs were also in English.",
          "We visited in July , it was very hot and the zoo, most animals were hiding.",
          "They have a variety of animals that most zoo's do not have including moose, bear and wolves. It is very close to the city of Innsbruck and was very appropriately priced.",
          "Fun zoo. But half of the animals are sleeping in the winter",
          "Highly recommended if you are nearby..",
          "Well organized and maintained. Animals have good enclosures and restaurant is OK. Who would have guessed turtles are an alpine animal.",
          "Hills and lots of them. Great day at the zoo.",
          "Its good, but doesn't have as much unique species as I would have liked. Mainly birds, frogs, fishes and one bear...Also some huge mice \ud83d\udc00",
          "Mountain animals! Wolves, moose, goats, eagles, an aquarium, cows, pigs, chickens, didn't see the Bears, I think they were higher up. Lots of hilly paths up around with views over Innsbruck. Easy to access, good self serve caf\u00e9.",
          "There aren't many animals. However, walking up the zoo was nice and the view is magnificent!",
          "Excellent zoo with a good variety of animals in natural settings",
          "You can tell the animals are well treated!",
          "Nothing special. Only go if you're using the Innsbruck card. Don't pay to go in.",
          "The zoo is on a mountain, so there is alot of uphill walking.",
          "May be ok for young children. Dissapointing experience for adults. In particular I was sad to see the bears in such a small area and with one exhibiting stereotypical walking. Most birds have also small cages.  Very sad.",
          "The highest zoo in Europe. It's called Alpenzoo because it's situated in the Alps and the animals showcased are all mountain animals. Enough space for every animal to wander around freely and they all look healthy as well, excellent place to bring the family",
          "Not many attractive animals in the zoo.",
          "Big Parc with animals from the Alpes.",
          "A bit small but interesting",
          "Nice but not much to see. Thier are many zoo's  better than this one. If you are a tourist and you have plenty of time in innsbruck than you can pass by, otherwise I dont recommend. Thier are alot of beautiful places to explore near innsbruck.",
          "Excellent and emotional",
          "Very beautiful zoo which is set up so that most enclosures can be viewed from different sides. Also a good explanation about the animals is given on the signs",
          "We loved our visit to the Alpenzoo. The animals seems happy and well taken care of. It's not a huge place (25ish displays/area) - but they are spread out, so expect a decent amount of walking. The otters were the best!",
          "It is a good day out for the family specially in good weather. The combo ticket will give you a return ticket by cable car and entrance to the zoo. Beware that it is on  a mountain and that means many slopes. Animals are in good shape and well taken care of.",
          "The animals all seem happy",
          "Very nice zoo.",
          "Not s zoo fan but all the wildlife are local",
          "If you love animals, don\u2019t go. I thought it was big enough considering it's an \"alpine zoo\" but it's not. It's sad to see all of them in such a poor condition, especially wolves and bears.",
          "Always fun but there are hills to walk.  Animals were out even on a winter's afternoon.  Not crowded either. Worth the trip if you  like zoos",
          "Great setting for a zoo",
          "Fantastic! Highly recommend for all ages.",
          "Amazing. We loved this place.",
          "Unique but only a few species...",
          "Very poor. It felt like a zoo from the 1960s. Seeing a Brown Bear pacing back and forth was distressing. It felt unmaintained and outdated. Avoid.",
          "There are not many animals and birds unlike other bigger zoos. However, they have been placed in a very thoughtful and convenient way to locate and enjoy them. If you have time to kill (which we unfortunately did not have and on the top of \u2026",
          "Nice view over Innsbruck, many alpine animals",
          "I liked the concept.  The place is beautiful with a nice view. The problem is that most of the animals are not really visible",
          "Great to visit",
          "Amazing place full of really interesting animals",
          "Small and cute zoo",
          "A beautiful experience that you should live it when you are in innsbruck",
          "Below expectations. What you read and hear about it does not match what you see in reality. Would advise to visit and waste time.",
          "It was a wonderful day spent in the zoo",
          "It was very fun to visit this zoo because it is different from the zoos I'm used to visiting, and there are special animals there that are not in any regular zoo",
          "Great zoo, not a big zoo but high quality.",
          "The Alpenzoo was a lot more fun than I expected.  Be advised that the zoo is on a hill and there is a lot of walking.\n\nNice collection of animals, well labeled, and they all seem very content with their enclosures.  Recommended stop for Innsbruck card holders.",
          ", Nice place to visit with kids although not all the explanations are translated to English   :-(",
          "We liked seeing the bears",
          "Unusual location on the side of a mountain. Specialist collection of animals that live only in the alps. Large collection of birds and small aquarium of fish, reptiles and amphibians. Modern enclosures for most animals and walkthrough enclosure for ibex. Best reached by nearby rack railway station that starts in the town centre.",
          "Unusual zoo.  Rather than exotic animals from afar, it has animals from the Alps.  Great for anyone not from the area.",
          "Very neat zoo halfway up a mountain.  The diversity of animals was neat.  It was also cool to see cold-weather animals outside of my native land (Minnesota, USA).",
          "Good experience",
          "Almost disappointing. Not that much to see.",
          "This zoo has the friendliest otter I've seen",
          "They catched a shitload of native animals and caged them on a small space. they even caught a damn bear. 5/5 for the brave animal catchers. would go there again.",
          "A very interesting and definitely worth seeing place. Easy to get to by car, cable car and on foot as well. A very nice, natural surrounding. ",
          "Not very nice visit for me at least. After seeing other zoos, this was okayish...",
          "Very nice place, if you wanna see a few animals whilst enjoying a great view",
          "Good place for observing the animals of Alps",
          "Nice zoo",
          "it is not a big,  and animals look a little bit sad.  I was in winter and they do not clean the road for walkers that's why I have my foot wet",
          "Is just marketing!  The most  interesting animal is just an eagle and a bear!",
          "Very nice zoo, we liked seeing the two bears playing hide and seek",

        "wiki": "The Hofgarten (English: Court Garden) is a protected park located on the edge of the Altstadt (Old Town) section of Innsbruck, Austria. The park covers an area of 10 hectares (25 acres), and borders on the Hofburg, the Kongresshaus, and the Tyrolean State Theatre.\nThe Hofgarten was originally laid out on the site of a river meadow under the direction of Archduke Ferdinand II in the sixteenth century. At the time, it was one of the most elaborate gardens laid out north of the Alps. During its 600-year history, it was turned into a Renaissance garden, a French formal garden and, since 1858, an English landscape garden. Its last conversion was conceived by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, but carried out four decades later by an unknown landscape designer who deviated significantly from Sckell's original proposal.\nThe Hofgarten is managed by the Austrian Federal Gardens (\u00d6sterreichischen Bundesg\u00e4rten), a subordinate department of the Ministry of the Environment (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft).\n\nThe Hofgarten is a recreation area within the Old Town with an interesting and varied stock of mature trees, a set of ponds, a modern children's playpark, a palm house, and a popular garden restaurant.\nThe Hofgarten management is responsible for taking care of the park. It is notable that there are still plants in the park that were planted personally by the Austrian Empress, Maria Theresa. The Tiroler Kunstpavillon (Tyrolean Art Pavilion) in the middle of the park dates back to 1733. Today, the pavilion supports numerous events\u2014mainly concerts. Chess tournaments are fought on the outsize chess boards next to the pavilion.\nThere is a lawn for sunbathing in the Hofgarten with a children's playpark. Otherwise walking on the ornate lawns is not permitted because they are susceptible to excessive use.\nThe palm house contains a comprehensive collection of about 1,700 species of plant, which may be viewed mostly on working days. During the temporary art and sculpture exhibitions in the summer season the palm house may also be visited at weekends.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nAustrian Federal Garden website about the Hofgarten (in German)\nEvent calendar for the Hofgarten (in German)",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages.

There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck.\n\nLocal public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes.  The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and V\u00f6ls in the west . Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.\nIn December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension across the Inn River and into central Innsbruck.  The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.  The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour. It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.\n\n\n== Education ==\nInnsbruck is a university city, with several locally based colleges and universities.\nInnsbruck is home to the oldest grammar school (Gymnasium) of Western Austria, the \"Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck\".

        "wiki": "Innsbruck Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of St. James (German: Dom zu St. Jakob), is an eighteenth-century Baroque cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Innsbruck in the city of Innsbruck, Austria, dedicated to the apostle Saint James, son of Zebedee. Based on designs by the architect Johann Jakob Herkomer, the cathedral was built between 1717 and 1724 on the site of a twelfth-century Romanesque church. The interior is enclosed by three domed vaults spanning the nave, and a dome with lantern above the chancel. With its lavish Baroque interior, executed in part by the Asam brothers, St. James is considered among the most important Baroque buildings in the Tyrol.Innsbruck Cathedral is notable for two important treasures. The painting Maria Hilf (Mary of Succor) by Lucas Cranach the Elder from c. 1530 is displayed above the main altar. It is considered among the most venerated Marian images in Christendom. The cathedral also contains in the north aisle the canopied tomb of Archduke Maximilian III of Austria, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, dating from 1620. The cathedral was heavily damaged during World War II, but was fully restored within a few years.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest reference to a church at the site of the cathedral dates back to 1180 in a document drawn up between the Counts of Andechs and the Premonstratensian Abbey at Wilton, authorizing the market to be moved from the left to the right bank of the Inn river, signifying the foundation of the old town of Innsbruck. The document specifically mentions an ecclesia in toro in reference to a church. In 1187, the Alte Innbr\u00fccke (Old Inn Bridge) was constructed along with the establishment of a market. The name Innsbruck was first used around this time.Not much is known about this first Romanesque church, only that it was incorporated in Wilten Abbey. Subsequent documents mention the first church, but nothing is known of its appearance or the artistic decoration. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the church was repeatedly destroyed or damaged by fire and earthquakes, making it necessary to repair and rebuild several times.\n\nIn 1438, Nicholas of Cusa donated significant funds to have the church completely enlarged. In 1472, the first sacristy inventory was conducted, enumerating large quantities of liturgical books, embroidered chasubles, monstrances, and chalices. In 1495, Albrecht D\u00fcrer created the first depiction of the church in a watercolor he made while on his way to Venice. The church is shown with a single spire behind the fortified walls of the city. The watercolor is now housed in the Albertina in Vienna.During this time, St. James was most likely a three-aisled hall church, common at the time throughout southern Bavaria and the Alps. In 1551, St. James was rebuilt again, converted into a single-aisled hall-like church. The renovation included plans to house the tomb of Emperor Maximilian I. Under Archduke Ferdinand II, a number of notable artists worked on the church, including J\u00f6rg Ebert of Ravensburg who constructed a new organ in 1567, and Alexander Colyn who created the tabernacle of Obernberg marble in 1571.In 1643, following a long struggle by the citizens of Innsbruck, St. James became the parish church, independent of Wilten. In 1650,  the masterpiece Maria Hilf (Mary of Succor) by Lucas Cranach the Elder was donated to St. James by Archduke Ferdinand Charles and entrusted to a well known Marien brotherhood. During that period, the citizens of Innsbruck fought to have the old church demolished and replaced with a new one much safer against the many earthquakes that shook the area during that time. The ambitious building project had the support of notable secular and religious leaders. In December 1716, architect Johann Jakob Herkomer and his proposed design was selected, and on 12 May 1717, the foundation stone was laid, and within five months the foundation was completed. On 27 October 1717, Herkomer died suddenly, but he was replaced immediately by his nephew and first foreman, Johann Georg Fischer, who followed his uncle's plans, with only a few minor alterations.The dome and towers were completed on 16 November 1720, and two years later Cosmas Damian Asam of Munich was selected to decorate the ceiling with scenes from the life of Saint James. Asam was paid 3,500 guilders for his work, and his brother Egid Quirin Asam received 2,400 guilders for the stucco work. The new church was dedicated on 9 September 1724 by Kaspar Ignaz Count Kunigl, Prince Bishop of Brixen. The nobility and parishioners embraced the new building and donated generously to its completion. The imperial family also donated valuable votive gifts. On the occasion of the birth of her eldest son, Empress Maria Theresa donated a silver sculpture of a child in swaddling clothes, as well as festive vestments. The interior was finally completed in 1732.St. James retained its general appearance throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1890, Albrecht Steiner von Felsburg was commissioned to undertake significant interior restoration. On 16 December 1944, St. James sustained major damage during the most severe air raid of Innsbruck in World War II. The bombing resulted in the collapse of the vault, the damage of frescos and stucco, and the destruction of altars and paintings. Between 1946 and 1950, extensive restoration of the church took place.In 1964, St. James was elevated to the status of the Cathedral of the Diocese of Innsbruck. In 1973, on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of St. James' dedication, the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral was renewed. Between 1991 and 1993, comprehensive interior restoration was done to address all remaining war damage. On 24 October 1993 at the conclusion of the restoration, Bishop Reinhold Stecher dedicated the new altar and crypt.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\nInnsbruck Cathedral, with its two bell towers and impressive dome, creates a dominant profile over the Altstadt (Old Town) skyline amidst the many green copper roofs. The stunning backdrop of the Karwendel Alps adds a dramatic effect.The facade, which faces west over the Pfarrplatz, is constructed of H\u00f6tting breccia and Hagau marble and is dominated by its two towers. The round arched wall niches in the concave curve of the fa\u00e7ade contain limestone statues of saints from the Tyrol: Hartmann, Cassian, Ingenuin, Albuin, Notburga, Romedius, Magdalena of Austria, and Heinrich von Bozen. These statues were created between 1941 and 1960 by Hans Andre, who also created the statue of the Virgin in the fa\u00e7ade gable and the equestrian statue of Saint James above it.The ground plan of the structure is traditional and cruciform with two west towers, a twin-bayed nave, a semicircle transept, and a straight-ended choir, framed by the sacristy and two concluding passages. The nave and transept are covered by saucer domes completely decorated with frescos\u2014the first time in the Tyrol where this decorative technique was used. Another unique element of the building is the placement of the dome above the choir, and not above the crossing which is customary. The architect Herkomer, who was known for bringing together \"all the church beauty from German and Latin lands\", chose a Renaissance approach by giving the church a unique architectural element that helped create a symbolic focus on the high altar and tabernacle\u2014a focus later enhanced by the inclusion of the painting Maria Hilf.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe cathedral interior projects a \"severe monumentality\" based on a series of heavy pillars that create a repeated triumphal arch motif. The pillars support the saucer domes that are in fact mock vaults consisting of flat wooden ceilings with concave moulding that spans the width of the interior. The segmented walls are divided by the pillars with marble lesenes on all sides. The powerful entablature is highly angulated and turns upwards above the windows creating links between the groups of windows.The high dome illuminates the choir and directs the eye toward the high altar, which takes up the entire width of the choir. The cathedral interior creates a \"sweeping spacial unity\", unlike the Baroque churches constructed in the Tyrol up to that time, which consisted of a tunnel vaulted nave of elongated multi-sectioned rooms with rows of chapels and galleries lining both sides. Herkomer rejected this partitioned design approach, and for the first time in the province, created an expansive interior with a spacial unity directed toward the domed choir and high altar.\n\nThe cathedral interior receives its characteristic appearance from the frescos that decorate the vaulting, with their color fully realized by the abundant natural light from the clear windows. The frescos were painted by Cosmas Damian Asam from Bavaria. Trained in Italy, Asam was the first south German artist to employ the technique of optical illusion to project endless space. The cycle of four frescos he created for the cathedral celebrate the life of Saint James, son of Zebedee, the patron of the church. In the main dome, Saint James is presented as a heavenly general with flag in hand, leading the Spanish Christian army against the Moors. The spandrels show the four evangelists, and the side arches feature angels with the attributes of Saint James. In the transept dome, Saint James is shown pointing to a Marian altar, urging the faithful to venerate the Virgin. In the fresco above the nave, the saint is shown interceding on behalf of suffering humanity. In the dome above the organ, the saint is presented as the intercessor for Innsbruck, the Tyrol, Austria, and the Catholic Church. The small spandrel paintings associated with each fresco show allegorical figures that reference the main frescos.\n\nThe stucco work by the artist's younger brother, Egid Quirin Asam, reflects the visual vocabulary of the Renaissance in both form and color, and supports the dominant presence of the paintings. In concert with the harmony achieved between the frescos and stucco, and between the natural light and color, the design of the floors and walls plays a special  supporting role. Consisting of an imaginative display of geometric patterns, the marble floors of the cathedral\u2014considered among the finest in Austria\u2014were designed by Christoforo and Theodoro Benedetti from the Trentino region. They also designed the nine cathedral altars\u2014all made entirely of multicolored Trentino and Veronese marble\u2014as well as the pilasters in the nave, for which they chose Hague marble. The side galleries above the presbytery, with their gilded Rococo ornamentation, were added during the time of Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nThe cathedral has nine altars: the high altar, six side altars, and two small altars by the chancel arch. The high altar is the showpiece of the cathedral. Donated by Prince Bishop Count K\u00fcnigl, the high altar is flanked by statues of Saint Ingenuin and Saint Albuin, the patron saints of the diocese of Brixen. The magnificent silver altar is one of the most outstanding examples of late Baroque craftsmanship in Austria. Donated by Elector Charles III Philip of the Palatine in 1712, this highly ornate tabernacle frame was enlarged in 1729 and 1750. On occasion it is adorned with silver busts of the church patrons and two Mannerist silver statuettes, created c. 1600 after a model by Hubert Gerhard.The imposing marble structure of the high altar contains the cathedral's most precious treasure, the painting Maria Hilf (Mary of Succor) by Lucas Cranach the Elder from c. 1530. Originally belonging to a gallery of paintings owned by the Electorate of Saxony in Dresden, this unique image of the Madonna and Child is filled with \"the dignity of the Queen of Heaven, the charm of the Virgin and the gentleness of the mother.\" The painting, which typifies the Baroque veneration of the Virgin Mary, was a gift from John George I, Elector of Saxony to Archduke Leopold V, and has resided in the church since 1650. On workdays, it is framed by Joseph Schopf's 1789 painting of Saint James and Saint Alexius venerating the Virgin Mary. On feast days, the painting is surrounded by silver angels and golden rays. Maria Hilf remains among the most venerated Marian images in Christendom.\n\nThe cathedral contains six large side altars in the nave and transept\u2014three on each side\u2014that were donated to the church by brotherhoods and private donors. The two altars closest to the entrance in the first bay contain panels by the Brixen court artist Johann Georg Dominikus Grasmair. The north side (left) altar shows Saint Sebastian, the patron protector of the plague who is especially venerated in the Tyrol, flanked by statues of Saint Charles Borromeo and Saint Nicholas. The south altar shows Saint John of Nepomuk, the patron saint of bridges and the second patron saint of the Tyrol. In the second bay, the north altar contains a Baroque painting from 1673 by Egid Schor\u2014an Innsbruck artist who was trained in Rome. The painting, which is from the old parish church, depicts Saint Philip Neri before the Virgin Mary. The painting is framed by marble statues of Saint Catherine of Siena and Saint Barbara, with a gilded statue of Saint Apollonia. The south side altar is dominated by a late Gothic crucifix of high quality, dating to the early sixteenth century. The Baroque statues depicting Mary and John are attributed to Stefan Folger.\n\nThe north transept side altar contains a painting of the Assumption of Mary by Grasmair, with statues of Saint Joseph and Saint Joachim. The south transept side altar contains a copy of Grasmair's painting of Saint Anne with the infant Jesus\u2014the original was destroyed during World War II. The two small side altars by the chancel arch contain Nazarene figures created by Dominikus Trenkwalder in 1893. The one on the left side contains a Baroque memorial tablet commemorating Kaspar Ignaz Count Kunigl, Prince Bishop of Brixen, who dedicated the church in 1724; the one on the right side shows Saint Peter Canisius, the patron of the Diocese of Innsbruck who played an important role in clarifying the Catholic faith in Austria during the Counter-Reformation.\n\nThe pulpit by Innsbruck sculptor Nikolaus Moll is a Baroque masterpiece from 1725. Gilded and silver-plated throughout, the pulpit is adorned by three divine virtues supporting the base, symbols of the four Evangelists, and a host of angels and cherubs on the sounding board. The base of the pulpit displays the Zech-Fieger coat of arms. Moll also carved the magnificent organ front, which dominates the west end of the cathedral. Serving as a pendant to the high altar, the organ's richly gilded casing, with its rigorous carving work and top piece with figure decorations, is regarded as one of the loveliest Baroque organs in the Tyrol. The organ front bears the coat of arms of its donor, Dr. Matthias Tausch.Completing the cathedral's unified Baroque interior are 14 stations of the cross painted by the Baroque artist Michael Ignaz Mildorfer from Innsbruck. Completed in 1734, these two-meter high works of art originally adorned the walls of the former convent church in Innsbruck.\n\n\n== Tomb of Archduke Maximilian III ==\n\nIn the left arm of the transept stands the canopied tomb of Archduke Maximilian III of Austria, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. Commissioned by the ruler of Tyrol, this work of \"great artistic and historical significance\" was modelled by Hubert Gerhard and Caspar Gras, and cast by Heinrich Reinhard in 1618. In 1629, the tomb was erected in the side chapel of the old parish church. When the church was rebuilt in the early eighteenth century, the canopy was divided into two sections that framed the two sacristy doors. In 1950, as part of the post-war restoration, the two sections were reassembled above the tomb in its present location.\n\nActing as a type of ciborium, the canopy consists of four turned bronze columns, adorned with vine leaves, birds, and small animals. The columns, which have fluted bases and finely cut composite capitals, support a heavy profiled marble entablature, which serves as both an abacus and as a stand for the group of four bronze figures. Dressed in armour, a bareheaded Archduke Maximilian kneels on a cushion with his hands folded in prayer. Saint George stands behind him\u2014his hand resting on the archduke's shoulder. Behind the saint, the slain dragon slithers away. At the two front corners of the entablature are two mourning figures with torches. This group of precisely modelled, immaculately cast bronze figures \"exemplify Austrian Mannerist sculpture of the highest quality.\" The tomb also commemorates the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Archduke Eugen, who was buried here in 1954.Born at Wiener Neustadt in 1558, Maximilian III was the fourth son of Emperor Maximilian II and Empress Maria of Austria. In 1585, he became the Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order, and thereafter was known by the epithet the German Master (der Deutschmeister). In 1587, he was a candidate for the throne of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, and a portion of the Polish nobility elected him king. As a result of a chaotic election process, however, another candidate was also elected. Maximilian attempted to resolve the dispute by military means, thereby starting the War of the Polish Succession. Although he had considerable support in Poland, his rival attracted more supporters. After a failed attempt to storm Krak\u00f3w in late 1587, Maximilian was defeated at the Battle of Byczyna in January 1588, and taken captive. He was only released through the intervention of Pope Sixtus V. In 1589, he formally renounced his claim to the Polish crown. In 1595, he succeeded his uncle Ferdinand II as Archduke of Further Austria and Governor of Tyrol, where he proved to be a solid proponent of the Counter-Reformation. Maximilian died at Vienna in 1618, and was buried in the canopied tomb in Innsbruck Cathedral.\n\n\n== Bells ==\n\nThe first documented reference to bells in St. James dates from 1394. Today the cathedral contains eight bells. The Mariahilfglocke (also called the Gro\u00dfe Pfarrglocke) is the second largest historic bell in Tyrol. It was cast in 1846 by the Glockengie\u00dferei Grassmayr. The Mariahilfglocke has a diameter of 2210 mm (87 in) and weighs 6342 kg (7 T). It is housed in the north tower of the cathedral and tolls every Friday at 3:00 pm to note the hour Jesus died.In 1961 and 1965, seven new bells were cast by Johann Grassmayr from Glockengie\u00dferei Grassmayr and acquired by the cathedral for the south tower\u2014six dedicated to various saints and the seventh named Totenglocke (Death knell). In 1982, the Innsbruck peace carillon was added to the north tower, consisting of 48 bells, making it the largest and most extensive carillon in Austria. The Innsbruck peace carillon has a total weight of 4100 kg (4.5 T) and was cast by the Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry. The peace carillon, which sounds daily around 12:10 pm, is the only carillon in Austria with a range of four octaves.\nMariahilfglocke, also known as Gro\u00dfe Pfarrglocke (1846), 2210 mm, 6342 kg\nPriminus (1961), 1720 mm, 3123 kg\nJosef und Georg (1961), 1410 mm, 1674 kg\nPaulus (1961), 1280 mm, 2121 kg\nAnna und Petrus Canisius (1965), 1020 mm, 680 kg\nMatth\u00e4us (1961), 940 mm, 475 kg\nChristophorus und Homobonus (1961), 850 mm, 356 kg\nTotenglocke (1961), 700 mm, 202 kg\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiocese of Innsbruck (German)\nInnsbruck Cathedral at Sacred Destinations\nDom zu St. Jakob (video)",

          "This cathedral has a long history in Innsbruck. It is architecturally and artistically very interesting. If you only go into one church, make it this one. Please note there is a nominal charge for taking photos but as the funds go into restoration it is a small price to pay.",

          "As others have mentioned, the cathedral doesn't look much from the outside. Inside is a different story - how I wish I'd taken my camera (left it in the hotel as it was only a whim that made me pop in and as a dinosaur, I can't take shots with my phone!). Stunning art work, an",

          "We hadn't planned to visit the cathedral, but were glad that we popped-in. The decorative bling of this cathedral provided a striking contrast to those in England. As well as being grand in scale, the cathedral is incredibly colourful & sparkly in decoration. Well worth a visit",

          "The facade and interior are both amazingly beautiful. Though the facade is a bit subdued compared to those in other European cities, the interior is comparable to St Charles Cathedral in Prague. It is really awe-inspiring. Definitely the most beautiful church in Innsbruck.",
          "Now I can be a bit of a cultural wasteland but I was really taken aback by how beautiful this cathedral is - certainly on the inside. Amazingly ornate, although we seen more beautiful in Italy, this place really took us by surprise and we spent quite a little while wandering",

          "It was not the biggest cathedral in Austria, but the baroque style/murals of St. James' is pleasing to the eye and provided a peaceful place from the crowds of the old town. It's free but they ask for a euro for a picture pass. Take a look and sit in the cool cloisters to rest",

          "Although relatively small this was a very beautiful and well preserved example of churches in this area. Having visited a number of the great French cathedrals I couldn't really get too excited I'm afraid. More a positive and integral part of the whole attraction of Innsbruck's",
          "This is a gorgeous cathedral. We have been here several times and have enjoyed it every time. If it is crowded, we just sit and wait until the crowds thin out. Sometimes there is music which is lovely to listen too in these surroundings.",
          "An eighteenth-century Baroque cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Innsbruck, dedicated to the apostle Saint James, son of Zebedee. Based on designs by the architect Johann Jakob Herkomer, the cathedral was built between 1717 and 1724 on the site of a twelfth-century",

          "We stumbled upon the church whilst strolling around the town. It would be easy to walk past the church as the exterior is, by comparison to it's decorative interior, rather neutral. A description of this incredible church would always fail to serve justice to it's ornate beauty.",
          "After enjoying the morning walking around the wonderful old section of Innsbruck, we ended up in a small park in front of this church. Compared to others we've visited, this was smaller and nondescript from the outside, but we went in to take a peak and it was beautiful.",

          "This is a Beautiful Cathedral, with side altars and frescoes galore. The interior is so bright and colourful, the high altar is vast and above it, is the holy picture \" Mariahilf\". Seeing all this wonderful colour, it's hard to believe that this was built in 1724. It was a",

          "Not to downplay this beautiful church, but it is very typical of the top church in the old town area of every city in Europe. It is really a marvel of construction for the time, the detail and beauty astounds.",
          "From the outside nothing, except perhaps the scale of the building , prepares you for the sheer opulence of the interior. Almost every square inch of the ceiling is covered with fine paintings of biblical subjects while on either side of the nave it is supported by Corinthian",
          "When entering the cathedral, take a deep breath and just gaze at the beauty of the interior. The artwork, sculptures and pipe organ are exquisite. A must see while visiting the Aldstadt (old town) in Innsbruck.",

          "We just happened to be walking around not paying attention when we walked down an alley way next to the Golden roof and found the cathedral of St. James. The little square in front of the cathedral is beautiful and a nice place to escape from all the noise and other tourists.",
          "As European cathedrals go, this one was, to my mind just a bit too ornate! On entering the cathedral, the very shiny 'reredos' behind the altar was quite overpowering. The ceiling has some very nice paintings. I do find it annoying when tour guides bring parties into cathedrals",

          "While on a 2hr walking tour of Innsbruck Old Town we visited the Cathedral of St.James and found it to be a relaxing and calm environment where you could reflect on your past and future. The outside of the Cathedral is spectacular and worth a visit.",
          "Very ornate and highly decorative interior, like a miniature Einsiedeln Abbey (Switzerland). There was a old rowboat on display on the front steps that was destroyed by vandals a few days before we arrived. :( Exterior also very picturesque. Crypt only for the faithful (prayers)",
          "We visited the Dom Zu St Jakob during a day trip to Innsbruck in April 2014. It has an attractive, unusual light red/marble brick exterior and is situated in a charming little courtyard/square just off the main tourist area. The inside is ornate featuring a very striking organ.",

          "The cathedral deserves it's 10 to 15 minute if you are walking in the historical center. But don't expect too much. You will not see neither great architecture nor masterpieces in the adornments. The cathedral is quite pleasant but very ordinary. There's a crypt but the tourists",

          "The funicular is in different sections, so you dont have to go to the top if you dont want to. The low level part is not so interesting but once on the proper cable car the views are wonderful - it is just such a lovely ride. The cars are quite big and very stable so even my",
          "I don't think it was peak season whilst we were there, but this is a really popular funiculare! We only had a few hours to spare, so queued up, got the funiculare, had some lunch a drink or 2 to enjoy the view (as did a few others we met with short time). Wished we had more time",
          "The cable car station is easy to find in town. The ride up the mountain was spectacular. We stopped at hungerburg to see the christmas markets and the town. At the top of the mountain is a small restaurant and great views down to innsbruck. We couldn't walk to the peak as you",
          "There are not many funiculars in North America so when we have the opportunity to ride one we do. We rode this one in Innsbruck to then take the cable car to the top of Nordkette. Lots of fun and lots of people. We purchased funicular tickets in a space-ship like building",
          "One trip with a funicular and two cable cars..... A tad overpriced at \u20ac36 but the views are stunning and there are lots of trails to go on if you are so minded. The last car down from the top station is at 1700 so be car",

          "You can take this Funiclar not far from the center of town. The station is quite interesting as it was designed by Zaha Hadid. You can go up to a nice viewing area and enjoy the views over Innsbruck. There is also a very small Christmas market during Christmas time.",

          "Quite an amazing ride up to dizzying heights in a matter of minutes. Quite expensive though. Check rates and the Innsbruck pass prices online before buying the tickets so you can get a good deal if there is one.",
          "BEST EXPERIENCE IN INNSBRUCK! Don't dare to miss out on this experience. The cable car gives you a scenic view of the city  up the mountain range that faces the Alps. It goes through 3 stops wherein each stop that has restaurants and skiing activities. A little bit costly at 36 euros per person but SUPER WORTH IT!",
          "It was excellent and beautiful :)",
          "Very expensive but worth every penny.  Go up and while you come back take a walk from Seegrube to Hungerburg. It's about 12 km walk (3,5 h with small children) but you can really feel the Alps. The only disadvantage (like everywhere in Austria) is the marking of the routes",
          "Well worth a visit if you are staying in Innsbruck or nearby! The view from the Seegrube or even higher is magnificent!",
          "Best view in town, above town - with great look to the East, South and West, high enough to be above the clouds most of the time - great starting point for hiking, skiing is ok for early beginners",
          "View was amazing but the cable car ride was horribly overcrowded.",
          "A pretty incredible view, not for people with fear of heights!",
          "Very nice architecture...",
          "it was really good and safe  trip",
          "Do not miss this if you're in Innsbruck. Worth every cent they charge for the ticket. Go a little early and get off at the interim stops too.",
          "Very effecient fun way of getting up the mountain, runs often and has a pretty good view for part of the trip, can definitely recommend.",
          "We loved this experience. While it says it only takes 20 minutes to get up the mountain, this is if you hit every car on time. We decided to wait for first seats for each leg of the journey and are happy we did: astounding views and the walks from up on the top of the mountain are once in a life time. Just wonderful.",
          "Amazing views, went up twice, once to go to the Peak and a second time to walk back down to Walchensee",
          "It's good. But zugspitse is much better",
          "Mmmm super",
          "Fast and practical as a means of transport. But it is also ideal for a tourist attraction when it starts to climb up the hill, better than a lookout tower, especially if someone doesn't like to climb stairs :)",
          "Must watch. Zaha Hadid architect studio. This is amazing. Expansive((",
          "Unlike some other reviewers we found the service good and everybody answered our questions.  A little bit of German goes a long way.  The cable car is great and takes you quickly to the mountain. No fuss. Not five star since a bit on the expensive side.",
          "This is a must vist place if you are in Austria. That views are mesmerizing and this journey will be worth the money that you are paying. There is a restaurant at the 2nd stop and the food quality here is too good. To make sure you make maximum out of your vist, please start bit early in the day.",
          "Amazing view! Use an Innsbruck card if you want to save money and see as much as possible in the town.",
          "Brilliant value, especially if using a City Card, also includes the Sighterrt Bus circuit and lots of other museums and places.",
          "It's good but it's cheap both in terms of price and experience. If you are too low on budget, visit here else go to Titlis.",
          "You need to get at the top whatever it takes",
          "Well worth a visit the view from the top are spectacular. It's a must if you are in the area",
          "If you are not afraid of high, worth the visit! Or else stop at one of the stop at hungerplatz at grab coffee or a drink!",
          "If you are visiting Innsbruck and have time of 3-4 hours then a ride using cable car is must! It runs in 2 parts from the Innsbruck (congress), 15 minutes to Hungerburg via Seegrube and remaining 30 minutes to the top station Hafelekar. You will get nice natural view of city and Alps through out the ride.",
          "Must see and must do if you're in Innsbruck. Even if you don't want to go hiking, you'll have unforgettable views at 2269 m!",
          "What a journey it was to Hafelekar.. Amazing.. Could view Innsbruck and adjacent snow capped hills. Was crowded though..",
          "The journey to the top is worth it.",
          "Fascinating... amazing... what an experience it was to visit Nordkette ... totally worth the visit umpteen times in all seasons",
          "Yeas..... you should really try this out if your visiting innsbruck. Really fun!",
          "Awesome ride on the cable car and stunning views from the top. About a 15 minute walk to the summit.",
          "Will take you to the top of the Alps in 20 mins from the city centre!!!",
          "Exciting! Beautiful panorama.",
          "Fantastic experience....7400m above sea level.awesome experience",
          "Simply amazing!what a wonderful experience\nRecommend for everyone who visit Innsbruck!",
          "Staff very helpful! It can get a little crowded however. The views are worth it",
          "The journey towards the top of nordekette through this beautiful cable car is amazing.",
          "The mountain is great and thoroughly recommended but the trip was like a rush hour tube, regretted not getting the bus instead!",
          "During peak seasons, expect to be packed like sardines.",
          "Good experience. Nice view on the top",
          "Says on the monitor that you will reach the top with a specific ticket but you need to still buy another one after 1/3",
          "Amazing view",
          "Fantastic seeing snow and sun at the same time",
          "I am giving this attraction one star only because the mountain was beautiful. However, the attraction itself truly deserves zero stars because of how atrocious and disgusting the customer service was. You would think a tourist attraction \u2026",
          "Good view of Innsbruck cityscape... Including the airport and the runway...",
          "A must do, beautiful hikes and what a view",
          "Great experience ... not cheap but it worth !",
          "Glides up the mountain perfectly like melted chocolate!",
          "Absolutely stunning views of the Alps",
          "Just Great, Highly recommend to do it.",
          "Absolutely beautiful views during the summer",
          "Nice but lots of people in one cable car is creates suffocation",
          "It was amazing.",
          "Must visit place in innsbruck. Good views from top",
          "That feeling of being small - absolute freedom",
          "Impressed by how flawless everything was, but the view...no photo will do justice on how spectacular the view is",
          "Wow! This was the highlight of our stay in Innsbruck. My wife and I love the outdoors and wanted to do some day hiking, see beautiful views and have something \u2018all in one spot\u2019 - this absolutely fit that bill.  \nI could see the price to get \u2026",
          "Absolutely magnificent view and worth every cent!",
          "Great, fast and at the top beatiful views...",
          "Absolutely must watch to enjoy great views of Innsbruck",
          "Too many people inside the train and Gondel, and not a lot of fresh air inside. \n\u20ac73 is also a lot of money for 2 people, going all the way up and down.",
          "Quite an experience!\nIts a technological marvel that they have made it! you get a great view of the innsbruck city and the surrounding mountains when u go up! \n\nIts one of the must do in the city!",
          "Awesome. Took me to the snow :)",
          "The best you can get",
          "DO NOT go here please UNLESS you speak fluent German.\n\nThe staff refused to help us at all.\n\nWe paid for a trip to the summit of the mountain and they left us at the halfway point but charged us for the highest point. \n\nA bit of a joke and a massive rip off.",
          "Spectacular view at the city. Quite expensive trip but awesome experience",
          "I have not words",
          "Very nice.",
          "Great views!\nWell worth the fare",
          "Superb journey to Seegrubbe - amazing views on the way. Prices are however also a bit steep at Euro 32.80 per person for return journey to Seagrubbe from Innsbruck.",
          "Awesome views. Beautiful scenery.",
          "Beautiful spot.  Take a jacket, a bit cooler up here than down at he bottom.",
          "A-M-A-Z-I-N-G \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Amazing landscape! It deserves the expensive price of the cable car.",
          "Mist visit. Best is to purchase Innsbruck card",
          "Cable car is available frequently. It's little cramped on the way up.",
          "Beautiful!",
          "Great views, definitely worth every cent!",
          "Very nice ,clean&good price",
          "The view through cable car of the mountains and city is amazing",
          "Clean, smooth ride. We bought a Combi ticket with parking and Alpenzoo. Was worth it",
          "Excellent visit and this price is high 36 EUR per person.",
          "Definitely worth going on...get the innsbruck card for a discount on the ride price and other attractions in the area.",
          "Worth a day drip from Munich. Reach the top of the Alps from the Innsbruck city centre. Can spend the whole day in this activity.",
          "Loved it .     Efficient and great views all the way.",
          "Amazing view of the entire city",
          "Fast cable car up to the top of mountains. It takes approximately 40minutes.",
          "Pretty expensive but well worth a visit",
          "It is worth the money paid",
          "A great experience, was wonderful with the snow fall, especially at level 3",
          "For 35 euro thought it was somewhat expensive just for a view \nThere is a cafe and a walk out view point which looked a bit hazardous to walk to in the snow so we skipped that \nProbably worth it if you are skiing or plan an extensive hike",
          "You better to try it once :)",
          "What a viee6",
          "Great view from to top",
          "A bit expensive but well worth it. The cable car runs frequently and there is very little waiting time to get on.  The lift brings you quickly up to amazing views and good hikes.",
          "Definitely one of highlights\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Enjoyed very much",
          "Really paradise on the earth",
          "I agree with Bailey Lurye on this one - the customer service was atrocious. Some other reviewers suggested that a little German goes a long way - which was certainly the case for all the other places I visited in Austria - however, it did \u2026",
          "loved it but long que",
          "Fantastic tour of the area worth a visit",
          "Really good service",

          "Fun railway up the mountain. My son loved it!",
          "Cable car @ IGLIS  having magnificent views of peaks of Alps. Stunningly beautiful farming slopes. One of the famous tourist attraction in the vicinity of Innsbruck, Austria.",
          "Nice few, but super expensive",
          "Very easy journey from the town centre via modern rack railway and then a cable car. Spectacular views from the top with the option of going even higher via another cable  car. Shop and facilities at the summit make it a comfortable and fun trip. Excellent value if you purchase an Innsbruck card.",
          "Easy way to get up the mountains. Have student prices",
          "Almost on the top!",
          "Buy your tickets online to skip the queue. Must see/must visit in Innsbruck!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT.",
          "Awesome experience",
          "Bit overpriced but the experience is great, service and staff is good too",
          "Gotta be done. But try and get a spot near the windows. Can be squashed in at busy times as people tend to think you can make more space even when there's no space but what an experience. Wish we'd got to go further up.",
          "expensive though! if you have time - hike up",
          "Great view.",
          "Best place  to view Innsbruck from top.",
          "Great view, friendly personnel.",
          "Very modern cable car with level adjusting cabins. Being in the front (facing the city) gives a good viewpoint. Nothing much more to see at the top. The small cable car museum is not worth the visit, just a bunch of old pictures.",
          "Best scenic views of the entire Innbruck city! Three different type of cable cars going higer and higher! :D",
          "A must try event in Innusbruck.",
          "Beautiful view at all stops",
          "To go to the top you can take this.",
          "Fantastic views!",
          "Nice way to get on the mountain over Innsbruck. Fast service and not so expensive. Around 9 \u20ac both ways.",
          "We really enjoyed taking the cable cars up to the peak and getting a spectacular view of the city. I recommend purchasing the Innsbruck City Pass - it includes the cable car and a number of other sights in Innsbruck, and it's only a few Euros more than the cable car ticket.",
          "Loved it",
          "Awesome experience. Out of this world is you come to Innbruck you have to visit this attraction. You will have the highest view of the city 7,400 feet.",
          "Staff was not helpful. We asked if we could ski and then said no even though people were going with skis (we only saw them after). We also got told that it wasn't allowed to take a one way ticket (while the machine let us do it). And \u2026",
          "4 stars? Only cuz it's a little expensive for a budget trip. It's worth it however. You can take it, straight to the top. The scenes in the way and on top are absolutely breathtaking. A must visit place!",
          "Amazing views from the top",
          "Take the Nordkette cable car to Hafelekar station and you will be rewarded not only with an exhilarating ride but amazing views of Innsbruck and the surrounding area. It's really accessible for everyone too. Minor point is that it seems pricey but if you get the Innsbruck card you get a free ride. Five stars definitely! ",
          "Ludicrous views. Quick cable car.",
          "Worth the visit. The cable car costed 35\u20ac until the topmost mountain. The views are beyond beautiful",
          "This cable car is definitely a must-do. Well organized, it provides a run each 15 mins. The view is amazing at each stage. I suggest to stop at seegrube (almost 2000m) unless you go for off track ski or snowboard.. I took the cable on a \u2026",
          "Google said it was open till 19.15... it wasnt",
          "There was an error on the line. We waited ages before told that it was cancelled for the rest of the day.",
          "Mast experience",
          "Awesome place u can see whole innsbruck from top , price a bit high",
          "Staffs are RUDE and VERY impatient. \nCable car itself is ok.",
          "Worth the money and time",
          "Jaw dropping views",
          "Awesome place must visit",
          "Steep cable ride to top of cliff.full of snow",
          "When u have plans to go up make sure u see the weather properly because if u don't u will be not able to see excellent view of city....",
          "Amazing view - taking you to the top of the hill by the series of funicular and two back to back cable cars. At every stop view becomes better and better. Don't miss this if you are in innsbruck",
          "Wow!  That's about all that can be said.  The day we took the trip up was very cloudy and overcast, so we weren't sure how it would be.  Eventually we broke through the cloud cover and could see for miles.\n\nBeautiful view and a good way to \u2026",
          "Great view",
          "Absolutely amazing, the views are incredible. For the wow factor experience you must go all the way to the top of the mountain. Going half way is good but not as good as the wonder of the alps at the top and the views on the otherside. It is a bit windy and cold but it is so worth it.",
          "Amazing, great views.",
          "The views are amazing.  Well worth it to get the Innsbruck card if you want to check out more than just a single sight.  We were there in early October, and the temperature at the top of the mountain was probably -10C, with 40kph winds.  Fun, but cold.",
          "Yes yes yes!\n\nYou must include this on any visit to Innsbruck. So so so with it. You purchase a ticket at the bottom. Then you get on the funicular train. It makes a couple of stops. One further up. Then at the Alpine Zoo then it\u2019s final \u2026",
          "Expensive at about \u20ac30 euros for a person to get to the top but worth it.",
          "Must take the cable car for great views of Innsbruck",
          "A must visit while travelling to Innsbruck. Amazing view from the top. I would recommend to take a single ticket till the last point of the cable car. Mesmerising view of the city and surrounding from the top.",
          "Best place to discover the alps and the aerial view of the city of you are visiting Innsbruck:)",
          "Impressive! Nice Cable to get to the top with a wonderful view! Falling in love with the snow mountain view on the top, you could also ski or have some food and beer on the mountain!",
          "Wow ! This is super attraction in Innsbruck though it is bit expensive. It is frequently operated and you will really enjoy the beautiful views from the summit. You can spend 4-5 hours here and suggest you to visit early in the day. There are few eateries near by but you wont find much varieties in it.",
          "The views are great and eveything about the ride itself is great. Price isn't cheap but it's totaly worth it. The only major flaw that I can think of is the fact that the cabins were overcrowded at times, but i guess it's the only way of \u2026",
          "Very Beautiful Mountain View",
          "Little pricey but worth the view.",
          "It was good experience",
          "Great location for any keen photographer, with 180 degrees views of Innsbruck you can enjoy some fantastic viewing angles. Also be careful of heavy clothes if you are planning on taking the lift to the top, as visibly on the top which goes \u2026",
          "JUST AMAZING",
          "Good place visit",
          "Great adventure",
          "Awesome experience!! Worth every cent. Stunning views, nice restaurant up on the top and fast, convenient trip from the center of Innsbruck.",
          "Fantastic scenery.",
          "Offers spectacular views over Innsbruck. The funicular is a little unnecessary if you don't mind walking as it can be done on foot in not much time. However the cable car us a must as you can quickly get to the very top, from which I recommend path 219. ",
          "It take 3 change in cars to reach the top of the Nordkette from the city. The ride to the top is breathtaking and offers a nice view of the Alps.\n\nThere are levels on the mountain used for different winter sports and mountain biking.",
          "Very nice",
          "This is certainly the easiest way to go up the Nordkette. You can walk it but you need to be made of sturdy stuff and it is a legitimate use if walking poles.\n\nThe cable car section sits at the top of a fenicular railway from City level, \u2026",
          "Safe and sound. Perfect!!!",
          "Nice place to visit and also good for tourists",
          "The funicular (cable train) is cheap, frequent and easy to use. The view from the train is great and it serves the city centre the city zoo and Hungerburg which has a really good view of the city and has a couple of cafes. \n\nThe cable car \u2026",
          "It was kind of hot",
          "Beautiful view",

          "Well worth a visit.",
          "Unfortunately we couldn't get to Seegrube because they were performing avalanche drills for several hours in the morning. I don't think they informed the public in advance, so the Hungerburg station was quite filled with skiers and snowboarders.",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley.

          "The arch marcks the limit of the old town and it reminds of the successful military enterprises of the locals in the Austrian army. It is impressive!",
          "We were not prepared for the existence of a triumphal arch in Innsbruck, so it was a pleasant surprise. In practice, starting from the Golden Roof and walking to the end of the beautiful Marie-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe, you arrive at this imposing Arch. We have discovered that it is one",
          "An iconic landmark that could probably be valued more by the city but definitely work the visit. A great view from our hotel.",
          "Another big arch in a European city, worth a look as you wander the old city but not something to make a special trip to see",
          "We had been in Innsbruck all day and were on our way back to the station, when we saw the Arch at the end of the road. We walked by it and took photos, but it was rather unimposing....it seems lost amongst the traffic.",
          "It`s the only arch of the city and is really impressive because it is in the middle of the road and you can see it traveling by car.",
          "This is another landmark in Innsbruck which we are pleased we took the time out to visit. The Triumphal Arch is impressive, was built in 1765, and is located at the southern end of Maria Theresa Street. We were interested to learn that on the south side of the arch are motifs of",
          "This arch is unusually created to celebrate a marriage rather than a victory so the symbols are different. It also ended up being a memorial so lots to look for.",
          "The arch is located amongst the traffic, so viewing it from a sidewalk is best. Capture and image as you walk through or drive around it.",
          "Free to see, the arch has some impressive statues and stands imposingly at a crossroads. Definitely worth seeing, but don't go out of your way.",
          "We passed the arch several times while walking around Innsbruck, the arch is ok but not really a tourist attraction worth going out of your way to visit.",
          "You will probably end up passing it if you come from the train station. Nice to see, I would recommend if you are within 5 minutes walking, or need a little time to kill.",
          "An iconic piece of architecture undoubtedly, the arch reminded me of Marble Arch in London. It\u2019s a great photo backdrop especially with the sun, also good to frame a view of the Ski Jump.",
          "Small by comparison to the Arc de Triomphe, this landmark can be admired while walking past. Cars drive through it and it is more part of the city's architecture than a tourist attraction.",
          "This is an arc close to the Maria Theresien street. You may visit this on ur way to the Street. It's not all that great. But can be done.",
          "Buy an Innsbruck pass for access to all public transport including Hungerburg funicular and cable cars. This also include access to all museums and hop on hop off bus.",
          "You can find it on your way to city centre. Nothing special. Just a gate from where you can see cars passing by. I between many buildings you even notice at once",
          "If we hadn't stayed directly across the street from this arch I suspect we would have missed it - so if you are walking from the OBB station to the center of the old town you will likely see it - otherwise, not worth the effort.",
          "You will walk through it going into downtown... that's about it. I guess it was a nice view looking forards as you head out of downtown, if you are staying out of the very centre of the city (which you can totally do and walk in even in winter, NP)",
          "At some point in the distant past, the Triumphal Arch in Innsbruck must indeed have been an impressive and striking royal monument. It is unfair, however, to compare Triumphpforte to the magnificent and similar structures in cities like Paris, Rome, Barcelona and Munich. In",
          "We walked pass this Triumph Arch during our visit to Innsbruck last week and it was not much to write home about. Being spoilt with magnificent historical buildings from other places around the world, this was not an impressive one. However, if you happen to walk pass it, at",
          "Unexpected in Innsbruck. Not as big as the one in Paris, nor the one in Berlin, but worth checking out when you're there.",
          "Quite a few cities have an arch like this. It is worth a photo, but it is not really much different from any such arch anywhere around the world, including some in the U.S. It was right next to my hotel, so yes, it was a pleasant addition to the surroundings, and looked nice",
          "This arch is in quite an unusual area, lots of roads meet at this point and it can be quite difficult to admire it with lots of buses and cars passing by, still it is worth seeing it. It is quite beautiful and not crowded with tourists.",
          "you are walking down this wide pedestrian only street and all of a sudden this big arch appears on the horizon. first impression - arc de triomphe. very nice, worthy of a photo.",
          "Nothing impressive, it is located at the start of the old center with trams and traffic passing it from both sides. It is not a beauty, not an impressive design/work. Just interesting enough for a quick look, but not a must see... no need for a detour, but then again the only",
          "There are many arches of triumph in the world, Paris, Palmyra, Pyongyang.....each has a similar design but a differently significant raison d'etre. This Roman styled arch is in Innisbruk Austria built in 1765 commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa originally to commemorate her",
          "An example of architecture and history combined and standing in a quiet part of Innsbruck. Worth a photograph.",
          "An arch at the corner of Maximilian and Maria-Theresien strassen built by the Empress in the mid-1700s in commemoration of her son's wedding and in the memory her husband. Nothing special but worth a picture or two.",
          "You may see this as you travel around on a bus or it can easily be reached by walking. When there take time to look at all the parts that make it up.",
          "Nice historical arch to view on both sides. It was nice to see and not far from several other sites you'll want to see and therefore be close by.",
          "Cool quick look over but nothing really that special. You should stop by but really only needs a 5 min look.",
          "It's a pretty sight, no doubt. And it's also nice how it's in the middle of a city, but at the end of the day, it's just an arch. It's pretty, but it's just there. Worth checking out, of course, because it's just there.",
          "One of the most prominent and well-known monuments in Innsbruck. It was erected on the spot where formerly the southern gate to the city. It was built in 1765 by Maria Theresa in honor of the marriage of her son Leopold II to the Spanish Princess Maria. When the husband of Maria",
          "Marking the beginning of the Maria Theresien Strassa. Dedicated to her son and to mark the death of her husband.",
          "If you've never seen an Arch you will love this landmark. Otherwise it's nice start of your walk to the old town following the Maria-Theresien Stra\u00dfe.",
          "You can miss the arch is you are nearly, but take time to look at some of the artistic detail. It depicts events of historical importance.",
          "If you are there, you should see it, but do not expect fireworks,it is just an arch ;) good for finishing walk in Maria-Theresa Strasse",
          "Great spot of the town before you enter the main road to the square but not very elegance Good for photo shot",
          "While driving into Innsbruck we came across the Triumphpforte and it clicked we should park as we were about to enter the Old Town! Nice enough monument, without being anything special. Keep walking in a straight line for 15 minutes and you'll see most of the Old Town.",
          "Innsbruck's version of the Arch of Triumph in Pars. We stayed at the Hilton Hotel, right next to the Triumphforte. Very good photo opportunities at night....The Arch is illuminated and with a good digital camera it photographs beautifully without flash and you can tell it was",
          "Was at Innsbruck just for a night but have left me wanting to go back again. It's a small city which all attractions can be finished by foot. Regardless if is day or night. I'm still loving it. Probably because i visited during the Christmas period where there're all lights up.",
          "Defiantly worth a walk up to the Arch especially at night beautifully lit up and when theres snow its just bliss!",
          "If you walk down the Maria - Theresien - Strasse, you cannot miss this large, architectural, Triumphal Arch.",
          "I forgot how beautiful this arch was after not seeing it in 20 years. I was afraid we were going to have a problem finding this but since we went to the Breakfast Club for breakfast, it was so easy because this was right by it.",
          "When you enter innsbruck you usually pass through the arch.its the \"entrance\" of the siteseeing of the city.",
          "As we walked from the train station to the old town this was the first thing we saw. It is a massive arch that stands at the end of the main street so you can't miss it! Looked lovely at night as it was all lit up.",
          "A nice old monument well maintained, like most monuments, this too is full of history. The South side shows motifs to signify marriage & the North side side to signify death, which is an unusual significance,all related to the Royalty of the past. It is better to look up the",
          "I actually rode past this lost on my motorbike in the darkness of evening so I went looking for it the next day. Well worth a look.",
          "It is at the beginning of Marie theressien Strasse so it is hard to miss a must see sightseeing point in Innsbruck",
          "It was another beautiful day in Innsbruck so we decided to have a stroll around town before breakfast, coming across the stunning Triumphal Arch, built in 1765.",
          "Right in the centre of Innsbruck and some good cheap cafes nearby, so avoiding the more expensive ones.",
          "It's just a small sized arch built in the 18-19 century. No stairways to go up. If you do some readups on this premise, you might be able to enjoy it. Otherwise it is not that interesting.",
          "built in 18th century and kept in a proper way. real piece of Architecture with all the history. but with the other building surrounding it looks little awkward.",
          "Honestly there is nothing much to it. You would anyway pass around where ever you are planning to go. Not impressive",
          "A Roman style triumphal arch, built by Empress Maria Theresa in 1765 to celebrate her son\u2019s wedding. It is located at the end of the main road to the Old Town. It has beautiful statues on the top. Vehicles pass through the middle arch so be careful. It is a beautiful",
          "Nothing impressive but good to see. You can view the ski jump and main train station from here, as well as the street leading to the main shopping area.",
          "This arch sits imposingly at one end of the Maria Theresien Strasse in Innsbruck. Saddened by her husband's death, she ordered it built. In fact it's known as the Triumphal Arch Maria Theresia. It is an arch. like so many others, built in the style of those in ancient Rome. And",
          "We passed the arch on our walk to the main railway and tram station. The arch remind us of the the one in Paris. In fact it looked like the smaller cousin of the Arc De Triomphe. Its a nice backdrop for a photo and has trams and horse drawn carriages moving along below it.",
          "A very simple arch but full of meaning and special interest especially to Maria Theresa, you have to look at those sculptures made at the south and the north sides, a celebration and the time of mourning, it depicts the marriages bonding and a tragedy coincided with it.",
          "In the middle of a busy road junction including trams. Well worth admiring and studying its history. Traffic still goes under it.",
          "Beautiful landmark both at day and at night. Located in the middle of the downtown area and easy access.",
          "Missed this on the way into the old town, but saw it on the way back to the hotel. It is a lovely looking arch and has a grandeur for its size. A good photo op.",
          "An arch to rival Arc de Triumph and Marble Arch. We happened to see it as we were walking around. Worth a short stop for a photo opportunity.",
          "It is located in the border of the old town and was built in 1765 for the marriage from Leopold (son of Maria Theresia) and the princess Maria Ludovica from Spain.",
          "We found that arch by chance because we were walking at the end of the shopping streets. it is a nice arch and worth seeing it and to snaps some good pics. During the night it is more cute due to the light of the city",
          "no signs in English, not much to it, worth a block or 2 out of your way in a city walk. Watch out for traffic",
          "It is located right in the center, at the end of their pedestrian area. Problem is that on weekend days a lot of cars pass by, and you won't be able to take a good clear shot. Otherwise it is really impressive and worth seeing it.",
          "The triumphal arch was worth a visit while we toured around Innsbruck from a landmark and historical perspective. At night time its appearance is even further enhanced within the cityscape",
          "Coming in from one side to another both side offers you different views of the town of Innsbruck the Ski Jump and the Nordkette sights to see plus the arch itself is nice.",
          "This Arch makes for a good photo op just near one of the underground parking garages to explore old town Innsbruck. You can walk directly out of underground parking take a few photos and you as only 5 minutes from the old town where you could spend an entire day shopping,",
          "While gorgeous to look at, this monument serves as a gate (pass-through) and is often used as a landmark to spell out addresses. Plenty of restaurants nearby, and close walk from Maria Theresien Strasse and the main train station.",
          "Just another superb testimonial to the artistic sensitivities of lovely Tirolese people. This is another landmark defining the architectual heritage of this nice town.",
          "The arch is at the end of the shopping area and it is a fantastic piece of construction, see it at night lit up just brilliant",
          "This arch is 250 years old, built to commemorate the wedding of Maria-Theresa's son - the future Emperor. During construction her husband died. She altered the plan and one side reflects his passing. For those renting ski gear - the best rental shop is just west of the arch",
          "The arch itself is an interesting structure dating from 1765. It now sits in the middle of a busy intersection on Leopoldstrasse / Maria-Theresien-strasse and Maximilianstrasse / Salumerstrasse so you have to take care when trying to view it up close. But the story behind the",
          "We stayed at NALA Hotel and to our surprise, the Arch was just a couple of blocks away. You can't miss it as you head to Maria-Theresian Platz. The architecture of it is mesmerizing. Definitely a great photo op, if nothing else.",
          "As its located in the middle of street it's not easy to have enough time to closely check it out. However it's still worth seeing.",
          "Given the size of Innsbruck's old town, this is a rather imposing bit of architecture, which dominates the far end of Maria-Theresianstra\u00dfe/platz. It's nothing like the Arc De Triomph or even Marble Arch, but it holds its own given its place in Innsbruck's history. If you're",
          "This arch is like the entrance into the old part of the city. With a fantastic history, a monument of happiness - for the queens sons wedding and also saddness that her husband died on the same day. Lovely to see",
          "The Triumphal Arch is worth seeing and photographing but unfortunately like other similar monuments that straddled a once less busy road it is now completely hemmed in by traffic.",
          "Look, it's not THE Arc De Triumph, but it is a lovely pice to see. The architectural lighting at night is truly beautiful and like most old buildings, it come alive visually when the sun goes down",
          "Was in Europe for business and made a quick stop in Innsbruck. This archway seems to be the gateway to the old city. The colors of the buildings behind the arch a bright and vibrant and you can see the mountains clear as as day. Really a beautiful spot and a really cool little",
          "Trumphal arch you can see on the way from the city center to biegesel, it is publicly accessible with no payments, good for history lovers.",
          "The Triumphal Arch seems to be the welcome sign to the old city. It stands proudly in the square and looks like a Roman arch. It's beautiful with its many statues. Empress Maria was the one that envisioned this arch and this monument was intended for joy. However during her",
          "Good photo point. If you find your way to this point then its straight up the long road towards the mountain and you end up at the golden roof. The arch is clean and well kept. Worth a look",
          "A literally great way to approach the old town and its main drag which stretches before you seemingly into the looming Tyrol. arches is arches but this one is worthy of a monarch.",
          "well kept and a very good back ground picture so that all will know that you were in Innsbruck. the area around is very nice.",
          "Apparently the king died the day the prince was getting engaged and so this arch has one side depicting the celebrations and the other grieving the demise! Interesting!",
          "Standing at the centre of a major traffic artery the Triumphal Arch is a little different to other similar structures around Europe. In addition to being an impressive Roman-style stone arch, it displays marble reliefs and sculptures, which transform it into a sophisticated",
          "This Arch near our Hilton hotel , we can see it from our room , it looks great and it historical , it is nice to take photo at night time .",
          "Cannot miss this whilst you are walking the Old Town of Innsbruck. Majestic piece - stunning at night.",
          "We live and breath and saw the arch everyday as we stayed in a hotel nearby. Try to make sure you view both sides of the arch as the story goes that, one side is a joyful commemoration of a wedding. The other side commemorates the death of the groom's father, who died two weeks",
          "We walked past this just to check it out. I do not know any details about it unfortunately. It is an arch. That's it.",
          "Stayed at the Hilton which is no more than 250 feet from the Arch. That makes the arch a great place to start your walking tour of the old town as it is at the head of Maria Theresastrasse. We got to see the arch coming and going---it is much more impressive when lit up at night.",
          "an Historical engraved Gate in the middle of the city. One can go straight to the famous Golden roof ally from here walking across the Mariatheresien Street. on the either sides are famous Restaurants. i have spent my holidays just pass by this monument several times in a day",
          "If you are in Innsbruck do take the time to see the arch. Make sure you view both sides. One side is very joyful commemorating a wedding. The other side commemorates the death of the groom's father, who died two weeks after the wedding. If you can, visit it at night.",
          "It is to be found at the end of the main Street, the maria theresia strasse, so you won't miss it. Nothing really special about it.",
          "Walked by this and read all of the inscriptions. It's a beautiful piece of art. Didn't get a chance to see it lit up at night, but heard it's beautiful!",
          "It is a nice arch, but does not deserve heading for it on its own. It can be a side dish for your stroll in Innsbruck, and it is not far from the train station",
          "Architecturally gorgeous. At the end of the shopping area it is very easy to find. I would recommemd having a look at it.",
          "but it is a cool picture on a clear day... with the alps in the background I had to stand in the street to get the best picture. It's not far from Old Town",
          "Looks nice when walking by. It is on the outskirts of the historic part of town, not too much to see except to take a picture of it.",
          "It is located at the end of main shopping street in Innsbruck. It is easy to find it and you can reach it after few minutes of walk from the main place of the city. Unfortunately is still under renovation and whole is totally covered. It is not possible to see anything.",
          "this structure was under renovation during our visit, with bamboo structures surrounding its front area, the back side was clear for view.",
          "Not much to do at the Arch other than admire its amazing architecture. However, it does serve as a beautiful backdrop when taking photos! I definitely recommend this place if you are doing a self-guided walking tour around Innsbruck.",
          "Historically these monuments have significance. I modern times these architectural structures are elementary. The location of this arch also lends to its interpretation. Not part of Old Town this looks strangely out of place with modern and utilitarian structures around",
          "Triumpahal Arch is around 500m from the Innsbruck railway station and 600 m from the city centre. If one does not want to walk take tram no 3 from the stand c of rly station and triumphforte is the next bus stand where the arch is. The walk from the arch to the city centre is",
          "As triumphal arches go, this is not one of Europe's greatest. It's not even the only arch in old Innsbruck. But because it is rather small, it's easily photographed. It's free to see - so the price is right!",
          "Actually is aTriumphal Arch ,as all others,even is in Paris, in London, in Belgium or any other place.We saw it, as we were in Maria-Theresa-Strasse, with the shops, cafe-bars and restaurants,the shopping -centre, and Ayia Anna column.",
          "The fraffic just moves around it. I doubt half notice it. It is a busy street built many years after this monument.",
          "Built in the fashion of the Roman arches seen in the Forum, the Arch depicts joy on one side, the wedding of Maria Theresa's son, Leopold II, and sadness on the other, the death of her husband Franz, the next day. If you arrive in Innsbruck by rail. cross the street after",
          "it's a nice arch, but not very interesting, it's difficult to take a nice picture of this arch, but if you are about to enter the Maria-Theresien Stra\u00dfe than it's the perfect place to start this route at :)",
          "There is a fascinating story behind that arch, see if you get someone to tell you or check it out on the Internet, watch close the two sides",
          "It is a very nice landmark seen at the main street of Innsbruck. Just like the Column of St. Anne which is also seen a little farther but also in the main street. All beautiful landmarks.",

          "This impressive Arch stands at the foothills of the Olympic Ski Jump Ramp and at the main entry road to Innsbruck, Austria. The plaques on this archway tells a love story.",
          "This place have a great view, wether you take a picture in a sunny day or in a bright clear night sky. Usually people just passing by and take some pictures on their way to the city center. I passed this gate a lot because my house is very near. Try to playing with your camera",
          "There is nothing to really enter or see here, but it is worth stopping to get a picture. It is an easy walk from any of the other main sites in the \"old town\" area. If you start your site seeing here you just go away from the Arch down Maria-Theresien Street (away from",

The permanent exhibition includes an extensive collection of old handicrafts, traditional costumes, household items, glass and pottery, peasant furniture, textiles, tools, metalwork, and religious and secular folk art from the various regions of Tyrol.\nThe museum houses several carefully restored wood-paneled rooms from the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque periods, that came from actual farms and noble houses. The museum also contains an extensive collection of mangers made of wood, wax, earthenware, and paper, dating back to the eighteenth century.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTiroler Landesmuseum",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970. The 1976 Winter Olympics were the last games held in the German-speaking Alps (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland).\nAlong with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Lake Placid, New York in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games.

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages.

There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck.\n\nLocal public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes.  The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and V\u00f6ls in the west . Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.\nIn December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension across the Inn River and into central Innsbruck.  The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.  The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour. It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.\n\n\n== Education ==\nInnsbruck is a university city, with several locally based colleges and universities.\nInnsbruck is home to the oldest grammar school (Gymnasium) of Western Austria, the \"Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck\".

        "wiki": "The Tyrol Panorama Museum or Tirol Panorama (German: Das Tirol Panorama) is a museum in Innsbruck, which is mainly important because it houses the Innsbruck Giant Panorama Painting.\n\n\n== Location and access ==\nThe Tyrol Panorama Museum is at Bergisel in the south of the city. It is accessible on public transport using the IVB lines, Sightseer, Lines 1 and 6, as well as the Stubai Valley Railway and Stubai Valley Bus. A further enhancement is planned in the shape of another bus line for the residents on the Bergisel.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\nThe Giant Panoramic Painting, that was transferred here in September 2010, is the main exhibit of the museum. It depicts the Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809 on 1,000 square metres of canvas.\nAnother focal point of the Tyrol Panorama is the permanent exhibition called the \u201cTyrolean Stage\u201d (\"Schauplatz Tirol\"). Here, the themes of religion, nature, politics and man will be used to explain the \"Tyrolean myth\" by using exhibits. Furthermore, the new house is connected underground to the Kaiserj\u00e4ger Museum, which is a \"museum within the museum\". The exhibition area is visually divided into four thematic areas. \u201cNature\u201d is presented in a 40-metre-long showcase in which, among other things, a cable car gondola and stuffed animals, such as a bear and a beaver, are exhibited. \u201cPolitics\" is located in the middle of the room, where, for example, the horse's head of the so-called \"Aluminum Duce\" monument in Bolzano or the valuable 1511 \u2018\u2019Landlibell\u2019\u2019 of Emperor Maximilian I are found. Interactive \"tree trunks\" show the \"man\" or \"Tyrolean types\". Here you can also find, for example, the pipe of former provincial governor, Eduard Walln\u00f6fer, or a self-portrait of the painter, Anna Stainer-Knittel. The exhibits on \"Religion\" are housed in large glass showcases at the back of the main entrance foyer to the Kaiserj\u00e4ger Museum. Among other things, a baroque pulpit and fresco designs from St. Theresa\u2019s Church by Max Weiler are displayed here.  \nWeiler mural of the \u201cArchduke Ferdinand II and Philippine Welser at Schloss Ambras\u201c was transported to the Tyrol Panorama on 21 February 2011, where it hangs in the restaurant. From 1953 to 2000 the painting was hung in the dining room of the old Hotel Tyrol in Innsbruck. The painting weighs a tonne, is 28 square metres in area and was painted in 24 individual sections.\n\n\n== History and controversies ==\nOn the initiative of the former governor of Tyrol, Herwig van Staa, the museum was originally to be opened in 2009 on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Bergisel. Its construction costs were estimated at six million euros, but this was significantly exceeded, at over 25 million euros. It was opened on 12 March 2011 as part of a large celebration. The opening was attended by 6,500 people. This led to a flash mob initiated by alternative groups to draw attention to the alleged lack of cultural support from the state of Tyrol. The initial reception for the Tyrol Panorama was positive however: 50,000 visitors were received in just the first 2\u00bd months. Many critics of the transfer of the circular painting also changed their opinion and are now convinced by the new location.The relocation of the giant circular painting had already been criticized by the Federal Monuments Office and International Panorama Council as being unjustifiable from the point of view of the protection of the ensemble. The Federal Ministry for Education, Art and Culture, on the other hand, judged the transfer of the giant circular painting into the Tyrol Panorama as a better conservation solution. Some critics have described parts of the exhibition as an arbitrary hotchpotch of exhibits. In addition, the lack of transport connections and  procedures for leasing the attached restaurant were also criticised. On the occasion of a visit on 3 July 2011, Claudia Schmied, Federal Minister of Education, Art and Culture said: \"The giant painting has now found an ideal location.\" She was pleased that \"the large and not uncontroversial project had now come to such a successful conclusion.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nIsabelle Brandauer, u.a.: Das Tirol Panorama, Rund um den Mythos Tirol, Hrsg.

          "We went into the museum out of curiosity and because we had an Innsbruck Card, which included entry. Honestly, it's a bit strange, with lots of stuffed birds and other animals (no labels or explanations), a massive mish-mash of I assume historically significant objects jumbled",
          "We allowed 15 minutes to see the painting before our transport was due to leave..... BUT The entrance area was deserted so we stood at the ticket counter whilst the two reception staff finished their chat. Finally one of them acknowledged us and sold us 2 tickets and gave us",
          "We visited this stop during our tour with the bus. The view of Innsbruck is quite breathtaking and gives a splendid panoramic view of the town and the surrounding Alps.There is also a small cafe at the stop where you can buy drinks and snacks or if you want to catch the next bus",

          "We went just to look at the 360 painting, but the rest of the museum turned out to be very interesting and informative as well! The painting is amazing - and makes you feel like you are plopped right in the scene. Looking at how Innsbruck used to look like, and then leaving",

          "the tyrolean panorama is stunning from just about anywhere, and the more so the heavier the snowload, just so long as the weather has not lowered. Which is a regular occurrence but, as any local will tell you, just wait a while and something - if not the entire encircling alpine",
          "The view on the city and Nordkette mountains is wonderful and it's a must here in Innsbruck! The museum is nice and big, so many things to see (it's not all very interesting, but something is very special), all about Tirol's history! There is an elegant bar too.",
          "This museum had many cool artifacts, but unfortunately I forgot to get the English audio guide so I had no idea what they were. It was still cool to look around though. The panorama is an impressive piece of art, but very disorienting.",
          "I visited this site with the whole family and was really worth to do it. You get an adio guide for free at the entrance. It is such an amazing painting that 360\u00b0 wall in the main hall. And the museum is directly connected to the \"Kaiserj\u00e4ger\" musuem thru a tunnel. All included",
          "This was a spectacular view of the city. Weather was decent for us otherwise I would not recommend it. We had our own vehicle so it was easy for us to reach this location. Museum was included in the Folk Art museum ticket we purchased so we went up and glad we did.",

          "We enjoyed the panorama as our 'hop-on' bus took us there. We did not went into the museum nor the cafe. But the views are worth it, as the mountains/clouds backdrop of the innsbruck was stunning! We just sat there for a while trying to take it all in! There also, a garden area",
          "The Panorama was surprisingly good, given that we didn't really know what to expect. The museum associated with it is really very good and gives a great insight into the region, it's people and history. The Panorama itself is excellent.",

          "If you buy an inexpensive combiticket, this museum is one of five included in the price. You can get the No. 1 tram to the last stop (Bergisel) and there is a bit of a steep climb uphill to get to the museum. The views of the city are a real bonus. The museum is well designed",
          "If one has the time and money go for stubai...strongly recommended.... Nice view not extraordinary, surely not worth visiting unless included in your ticket",
          "Take the #1 Tram to the last stop. Excellent view of the city at the foot of the mountain. A great photo op. The museum is OK at best. Don't go to the restaurant. Walk up the road to the Spiegal Beer Garden. Cheers!",

          "Fabulous museum depicting the Tyrolean peasants defeating Napoleon's army. The centrepiece is a 360 degree painting of the time - quite spectacular! The museum is joined by the Kaiserjaeger Museum that gives a broader look at Tyrolean military history, again excellent. One",

          "The low level view from this site is very good as you can still make out the details of key landmarks in Innsbruck. Must be spectacular in the winter when the backdrop of the mountains are all white with snow. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "The Tirol panorama is connected to the Kaiser museum, both depicting the Tirol history. The panorama is a 360' painting about Tirol-Bavarian war for independence. The museum displays artifacts and people from that time. Not a must see, but if you have the high value Innsbruck",
          "This is a must see when in Innsbruck! Love the setup of the museum and the panorama is a wow! Brings to life the war fought in the vicinity of Innsbruck!",

          "Quite Amusing to go to the Top & see the Alps. It is nice to spend a few hours at the top & play with snow.",
          "Very nice and well layout museum, the exhibition shows a lot of the military history of Tyrol and modern history, you could spend some time here exploring, and learn from this awesome facility. The 360 degrees exhibition was impressive.Next door is the Bergisel Ski Jump, another",

          "Lovely views and the male waiter was excellent, really efficient and smiley. Great value food and drink.",

          "When I saw how uphill the walk from the Berg Isel tram stop was my heart sank. Then it nearly burst when I hauled myself up the hill. Totally worth it! The panorama itself is a fascinating piece of art and does look like the area it portrays. The panorama museum itself has an",

          "I have never seen such a huge fully encircling painting like this. Amazing art that feels like you are looking at the real thing. A very modern museum to hosts this piece of Tirolaean history. the views over the city are also special.",

          "The Tirol Panorama is nice to visit as it shows the most important battle of tyrol in a 360degree painting. Great to combine with a visit of the Bergisel ski jump",

          "the panorama room is perfectly restored. The rest of the museum might be verry interesting for tiroleans and other austrians, but for foreigners there are more interesting places to visit (unless you are interested in war-history of course). Nice view on the city, but for a",
          "Wasn't expecting to like this as much as we did. The history of it was quite interesting and the artwork of the panorama is stunning. The way the foreground items tie into the painted area adds a great touch of realism.",
          "Wasn't sure I was going to like this but was really glad we went. It was amazing. The panorama was well done and really interesting. You can also visit the Olympic ski jump which is a bit scary looking from the top. In the caf\u00e9, that is.!!",
          "Very good views from here, a nice cafe/restaurant but a bit limited foodwise, no sandwiches etc when we went, mostly hot food. you can walk up to the Ski jump but have to pay beforehand obviosly to get into this as it is separate. Can see for miles all around, worth a visit.",
          "I only got in because it was at the same place as Berg Isel (in front of Sightseer stop) and I had Innsbruck card (to get in for free.) It turned out to be a very big surprise. I thought that it is just a hugh art musueum but they got really big collections of Tirol cuture!",

          "The panorama itself was far more impressive than I was expecting and now it is in the right location you are in position to easily see how little the view has changed in 200 years. The buildings of Bergisel are very recognisable. There's a lot of information on Tyrolean",
          "Great 2 1/2 hours of exercise walking down. View was spectacular and options on what to do once there were great too",
          "This was included on the Innsbruck card so we went in for a look. You have to put all your bags in lockers (you need three euros but you get it back). There were a lot of security guards giving you stares, which made it feel slightly unfriendly. The receptionist knew we spoke",
          "The round picture of the battle on Berg Isel is now housed in this new building, the round picture is as impressive as you would expect a painting of a battle to be (i.e. impressive as a work of art for its sheer size but not for very much else), still it is interesting to",
          "We loved this. We've been to larger American sites like Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, but we still enjoyed this view very much. The restaurant surprisingly had the best asian food and loved the lay out chairs to catch a little sun.",
          "The museum is next to the Bergisel and can be bought as a combined ticket. Both are well worth visiting. The painting as the centre peice is stunning and well displayed. The other exhibits are also of interest and explain much about the history of the area. The views from here",

          "Very nice restaurant with perfect service",
          "The panorama itself is overrated. The museum has a potential but, in my opinion, it is badly arranged. The audio guide is kinda useless, there is info for only ~5-10% of the items. Some simple labels in English would improve the experience a lot.",

It is of course told from the Austrian side, so the fact that they ultimately lost the battle described in the painting is glossed over along with any better sense of how the story fits into Napoleonic history.",

It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Grassmayr Bell Foundry  is a maker of church bells founded more than 400 years ago in Innsbruck, Austria. The business was founded by Bartlm\u00e4 Grassmayr in Habichen, a hamlet in the municipality of Oetz. At present, the company is Austria\u2019s oldest family-run business and one of the largest bell manufacturers in the world, having supplied bells for eight religions in more than 100 countries on every continent.\n\n\n== History ==\nBartlm\u00e4 Grassmayr founded the company in 1599 in Habichen with the casting of his first bells after an eight-year journey; the company is probably the first bell foundry in Tyrol. He learned the art of bellfounding from the Aachen bell founder Joan von Teer. On 29 March 1595, it was acquired by his father, Hansen Grassmayr and was initially used for the casting of \"harbors\", the precursor of today's cooking pots.\nOn 16 May 1601 Bartlm\u00e4's son Johann Grassmayr (died 4 April 1683 in Wilten) was born. He continued the family business for many years. He completed the bell foundry apprenticeship with his uncle Jakob Veit Grassmayr in Feldkirch and spent several years as a wandering bell founder.\nWith the improvement of the transportation system in the country, the company relocated its headquarters to Innsbruck in 1836, where the foundry remains today. Further enterprises were then opened in Feldkirch and Brixen.\nAt present, Johannes Grassmayr of the 14th generation manages the business.\n\n\n=== Traditional and modern symbols ===\nAt least one source has identified the symbols Grassmayr uses as maker's marks on their bells. These include sage leaves, angels and the griffin. A modern addition is the salamander.\n\n\n== Notable work ==\nThe oldest bell in Italy, cast in 1635, is a Grassmayr product.\nThe six bells of the Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral were cast by Grassmayr. The largest measured 3.3 meters high by 3.3 meters wide and weighed 25 tons.\nThe Innsbruck Cathedral's Mariahilfglocke, the second-largest bell in Tyrol, was cast by Grassmayr in 1846. Seven other bells in the cathedral are also Grassmayr-made.\nThe world's largest tubular bell was cast by Grassmayr for the city of Aarhus, Denmark in 2015 as part of its preparations for becoming European Capital of Culture in 2017. The bell is 7.5 meters in length, 80 centimeters in diameter and weighs 3 tons. It is rung every time a baby is born in the city.\nA 15-ton bell was cast by Grassmayr in 2012 for the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem monastery in Mount Tabor, Israel. Measuring almost 3 meters in diameter, the bell was transported by Gebr\u00fcder Weiss to Trieste and from there it was sent by ship to Israel.\nGrassmayr cast the 10-ton M\u00f6sern Peace Bell on the occasion of the Association of the Alpine States 25th anniversary. It is the largest swinging bell in the Alpine states area. It is rung daily at 5:00 in the afternoon.\nGrassmayr cast a 100-kilogram bell on the occasion of Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines in 2015. A 24-bell carillon was also completed for the Baclaran Church that same year.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1704, in gratitude, the Landst\u00e4nde vowed to build a monument commemorating the event.\nThe column was made by Trient sculptor, Cristoforo Benedetti, from red Kramsach marble. On the base are four statues of saints:\n\nin the north, Saint Anne, the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nin the west, Cassian, patron saint of the Diocese of Bozen-Brixen.\nin the east, Vigilius, patron saint of the Diocese of Trient.\nin the south, Saint George with dragon and lance, then and since 2006, patron saint (now together with Saint Joseph)Towering above these four statues is the column with its statue of Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse.\nThe column was consecrated on 26 July 1706 by Prince-Bishop Kaspar Ignaz, Count of K\u00fcnigl. It has been restored several times over the centuries. In 1958, mainly for conservation reasons, the figure of Mary was replaced by a replica and the original was loaned to the Abbey of St. Georgenberg-Fiecht, where it has been placed in a side chapel of the abbey church of Fiecht (near Schwaz) above Saint Mary's altar.\nOn 10 October 2009 the figures of saints on the base of the monument were also substituted; the originals are now on the first floor of the Altes Landhaus in Innsbruck.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBavarian Rummel.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to St. Anne's Column at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Not too much to see - street is covered with parked cars. Drunks were camped out at base of column - so definitely not a place to bring young kids. Some good shopping close by. Definitely not worth going out of your way for.",
          "This column can be found on the main shopping street leading to Innsbruck's old town. It's quite beautiful but a little difficult to enjoy with all the shoppers around.",
          "It is set in a nice, wide, car free part of the old center so it does stand out. However looking at it closely it doesn't impress... no special sculptures on it just the color of the column itself is the only special feature... apart from that it is one like so many others...",
          "This is a nice area to be in and walk through. Take a lot of pictures from different angles at the column.",

          "Kind of like everyone else has said it's beautiful, a nice place for a walk and shop, but not something you're going to spend a long time at.",
          "Centered on the Maria Theresien Strassa, the great mall for strolling, eating, relaxing over coffee and shopping.",
          "The Annasaeule is a beautiful column in Innsbruck. It may not look like much to tourists, but these columns are an important part of Austrian identity and culture.",
          "This historical column (made by the Italian sculptor Cristoforo Benefetti) is nice to see because it's situated in the middle of Maria-Theresien Stra\u00dfe. No more, no less.",
          "Another point of interest as you walk around the town. A good photo stop with the backdrop of the alps.",
          "In itself it is an average monument, but the view towards the north with the Town Square and the Alps beyond is wonderful. Surrounded by shops, caf\u00e8s and restaurants. A great meeting place.",

          "St Anne's Column is easily accessible and located in the center of Innsbruck old city.... Maria-Theresien-Strasse. A busy gathering point of locals and tourists and you just cannot miss seeing it. You would regret not taking a photo of this interesting monument created to mark",

          "If nothing else, this is the place to stand for a photo of the most magnificent backdrop. It is particularly good, late afternoon when all the bust tours have left!",
          "This is really less than the destination than a interesting point to see and experience while shopping and walking around Innsbruck",
          "To be fair if there was a plaque explaining the significance of the column I must have missed it but it is a good meeting point if nothing else.",
          "This monument is situated in a nice street but the monument itself is no so special. In my opinion definitely not a highlight of Innsbruck.",
          "You can't miss this sightseeing. It is right on the main street in the city center and you will really enjoy the atmposphere.",
          "It is located in the centre of the Old Town. It is under renovation at the moment. Pity! Well placed in a square near shops, bars and restaurants. The religious statues on the column are striking. The column has a beautiful backdrop of the mountains.",
          "Even for those who care little for history, this column adds drama and beauty to a central traffic-free zone in Innsbruck. I find it particularly impressive from the rear, as in the distance, on a fairly clear day, you can see the mountains beyond it. There is in fact a lot to",

          "Major statue right in the 'square' of the Medieval Maria Theresiastrasse. It\u2019s easy to be recognised as the meeting point. Also the whole street is quite fascinating with colourful buildings and shops. Beer or seafood or major restaurants or churches.....it is there for you to",

          "It 's just another column---take a photo and move on down to the Golden Roof. Can't say much more than that.",
          "The column is the main landmark of the Medieval Maria Theresiastrasse. It\u2019s easy to be used as the unmistakable meeting point. Also might be considered as a main topic for pictures in this area, although the whole street is quite interesting from this point of view.",
          "Ok yes it's just a column. The view of the colum withe the Virgin Marry in the fore ground and the city and the Alps. (Especially in the winter and spring when the alpha are capped in snow",

          "It is quite pretty to look at sitting in the middle of the square. The tourist guide we had had only minimal information and I'll bet that with the right book, there was likely a very interesting history to go with it.",
          "This is a truly unappealing column, located in a square in Innsbruk's old town. The column itself if filthy and its surroundings are as well. We passed by the column during the evening, as well, only to find a bunch of local teens, drunk beyond belief, urinating on its base.",
          "They used to be a structural achievement but as architecture advanced such structures are not so impressive. While colorful it is used more as a landmark then a remembrance of any event. You will come across this column as you wander through the Old City. I have a 32 gig",
          "An interesting monument to gaze at for a couple of minutes, in the center of Innsbruck's Old Town, especially if you know it's place in Austrian history & the commemoration of its independence from Bavaria. Not worth walking out of your way to find. There are more impressive",

          "I needed to kill 2 hours waiting for my family to arrive from London and the Tyrolean Provincial Museum was less than a 5 minute walk from my hotel and 11 Euros to enter. The pass also can allow you to get in to a few other museums in the area, though I was moving on to Ischgl",

        "wiki": "The 14 cm Minenwerfer M 15 was a medium mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was developed by \u0160koda Works as an alternative to a German design from Rheinische Metallwarenfabrik/Ehrhardt for which ammunition could not be procured. It was a rigid-recoil, rifled, muzzle-loading weapon that had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It was lifted onto a two-wheel cart for transport.\nThe M 16 version added a central barrel ring and cutouts on the side of the carriage. Rotation within the barrel was improved, greatly increasing accuracy. It weighed an extra 20 kilograms (44 lb), but had a maximum range of 1,080 metres (1,180 yd). Its transport cart was also improved.\nThe first batch of 100 mortars was ordered in May 1915 and a second batch in spring 1916, but deliveries were slow; only 88 of the second batch could be sent to the front by May 1916. A third batch of 300 was ordered in November 1916, but production was such that only 30 had been delivered by the spring of 1917.\n\n\n== References ==\nOrtner, M. Christian.

        "wiki": "The Swarovski Crystal Worlds (Swarovski Kristallwelten) is an experience attraction created by Andr\u00e9 Heller for the crystal glass manufacturer Swarovski, consisting of a park, art museum, retail area, and restaurant. It opened in 1995 and is located in the Austrian Tyrol, near Innsbruck, in the town of Wattens, Austria, where the company was founded and still has its headquarters today. Crystal Worlds, together with the Swarovski Kristallwelten Store in Innsbruck and Vienna, form D. Swarovski Tourism Services GmbH. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Swarovski company was founded by Daniel Swarovski in 1895. One century later, multimedia artist Andre Heller was commissioned to design the museum with fourteen chambers of wonder in the form of a giant to celebrate the 100th anniversary of D. Swarovski KG. After the initial opening in 1995, further expansion and renovation projects followed in 1998, 2003, and 2007.\nExpansion in 2014/15\nIn October 2014, the renovation and expansion of Swarovski Crystal Worlds began, at a cost of around 34 million euros, to celebrate the 120th anniversary of the Swarovski company, and the 20th anniversary of Swarovski Crystal Worlds itself. It reopened on April 30, 2015. The overall area of the attraction was extended from 3.5 hectares to 7.5 hectares. New features added to the garden during this expansion included the \u201cCrystal Cloud\u201d made up of 800,000 crystals, a playtower, and the restaurant, Daniels Kristallwelten.\n\n\n== Chambers of Wonder ==\nInside the Giant there are exhibition spaces, based on the concept of the historic chambers of art and curiosities favored by aristocratic families in the 16th century. In the Chambers of Wonder at Swarovski Crystal Worlds, internationally and nationally recognized artists, designers, and architects, such as Brian Eno, Tord Boontje, Niki de Saint Phalle, Jim Whiting, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Yayoi Kusama, have interpreted crystal in their own ways. 17 show rooms were created, each of which has a different thematic focus.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\u2022\t17 underground Chambers of Wonder\n\u2022\tOne of the largest Swarovski Stores in the world\n\u2022\tgarden landscape\n\u2022\tCrystal Cloud with 800,000 hand-mounted crystals\n\u2022\tPlaytower and open-air playground\n\u2022    Carousel \n\u2022\tDaniels Kristallwelten restaurant\n\n\n== Events ==\nIn 2019, \u201cMusic in the Giant\u201d \u2013 a festival of chamber music under the artistic direction of Thomas Larcher \u2013 took place for the 15th time. Other events include family days, workshops for children and young people, and culinary events.\n\n\n== Visitors ==\nIn 2011, Swarovski Crystal Worlds was ranked eighth amongst the most popular tourist attractions in Austria, with 680,000 visitors, ahead of locations such as the Imperial Apartments at the Hofburg, and the Albertina art gallery in Vienna. \nAnalyzed by country of origin, in 2009 the majority of visitors came from Germany (26%), followed by Austria (13%), Italy (11%), India (8%), and China (5%). \nIn 2019, the total number of visitors to Swarovski Crystal Worlds reached 15 million.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Swarovski Kristallwelten (Crystal Worlds) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

          "This place was truly unique. The staff at the attraction, store and restaurant were so helpful. We did find the worker at the ticket office to be a bit frustrated. We did not have the tickets actually printed off and this made it a little frustrating. Still, everything worked",
          "Our kids really enjoyed this, & we were surprised how interesting it would be. The price is pretty reasonable with the family pass. It was nice during the holidays, although we had drizzle while there so we couldn't enjoy the outside as much as we wanted & couldn't see the",
          "An interesting museum, which is very interactive for children. Recommended time for this museum in my opinion is 4 hrs. The site has a playing tower, which our children really enjoyed.",
          "The place is very nice and there is something worth of the place.A day visit can make the tour about swarovski .",
          "We had a great time in Swarovski Kristallwelten. The art pieces made of Swarovski crystals were really interesting and worth seeing, also the Lights show outside was beautiful. We spent 2h there but I would say it was a bit of a rush as the place was crowded. I guess 3h would be",
          "It seems that the only way to be welcomed is by car. The overpriced shuttle bus is actually less frequent than local public transport. We walked from and to the station. Not a single sign helped us to find the way. But of course it would be easy to find the way to the car park.",
          "Wonderful exhibits and great place to visit! Inside the giant is lots of wonderful art pieces that are quite enjoyable. Daniels restaurant is also a great place to grab a bite to eat. The Christmas lights were also a great addition.",
          "Not super impressive. The inside is quite silly infact. Would not recommend you pay extra just to see this. If you get the innsbruck card and have extra time to kill in innsbruck, consider visiting this place.",
          "Here you can see beautiful pieces of art using cristals, but you can also experience hologram videos and buy Swarovski products with special prices. The exterior is amazing and has a big parking place.",
          "We traveled about an hour from Gramisch-Partenkirchen, Germany to see this museum and factory. Upon our arrival we were disappointed to find the factory to be off-limits to any guests. But the grounds of the museum were spectacular. We very much enjoyed traveling through the",

          "The light shows outside are breathtaking and were the hilight to us and our daughters. The Christmas lights everywhere make it a wonderland! Loved the crystal tree light show. Inside we found it the most bizarre thing and not at all what we expected. Some exhibits are just too",
          "Several expositions playing with light, colors and even smell. This is nothing even close to a jewelry museum. It\u2019s more of an art gallery, but for ordinary people. It was a pleasant surprise to us and we enjoyed taking photos and videos there as well, which is not only",
          "My wife and I were staying in Innsbruck for five days and we bought a 72 hours Innsbruck Card (excellent decision!). One of our musts was also the Swarovski which looked magnificent on all photos (the face looking exterior with the waterfall). When we came there the exterior was",

          "Very confusing layout and minimal suggested path. We ended up starting at 2nd to last exhibit and had no idea where to start. Even with the audio, we had no idea which room was next or where to go. The \"chandelier & mirror\" room and \"inside crystal\" room were 100% worth it!!",
          "We were a bit underwhelmed. Our kids loved the play areas but we felt it was expensive and not really worth it. The exhibits were weird to us.....we are not art connoisseurs so maybe just not our cup of tea! We would not return.",
          "It is one of the main attractions and also, an iconic place (thanks to the waterfall). It was on my list for many many years but I was left not so impressed and kept searching for that one thing which will \"amaze me\". It is good enough to spend a couple of hours here, click",

          "The overall experience was a good one with some of the displays very cleverly put together. The restaurant provided a fair selection, but the local guy in the reworked Combi van selling hot dogs was the go. The shop is large with every kind of crystal product available to",

          "Definitely a visually present experience. An opportunity to spend nice day in a family activity near Innsbruck.",
          "My husband and I don't like art much, but this was a wonderful display of crystal and art blended. We appreciate that everything was in English also. Lots to see both inside the giant and outside. Free with the Innsbruck card, shuttle too. Highly recommend!",
          "Most disappointing. Uncomfortably dark rooms and the audio commentary did not switch on to the next room when you moved on, thus still commenting on the previous room when you wanted to hear about the next room. It would have been much more interesting to know how the",
          "Took the Swarovski shuttle from the old town (hofberg/Congress stop), takes about 25 minutes. Shuttle runs about about once every 2 hours. Plenty of parking available if driving. Great exhibits, outdoor activities too, merry go round, crystal garden, maze, and a playground",
          "We thought that this would be a factory look round however it wasn't . It is an art exhibition . I am being rather harsh really just giving 3 stars because it was well done and a very different concept but didn't really appeal to my husband. He would give 2 stars and me 4 so met",

          "It's certainly a different experience from the other things in Austria. But it's not a must. If you have time in Innsbruck and if you have the Innsbruck card with which the shuttle and entrance is free then you should do it. Some of the crystal and light works were very good.",
          "They say they're open from 8:30 AM but we came there 8:48 AM on tuesday and all parkings were taped with red/white stripey tape, gates closed, doors locked. Tried 2 different entrances, one where all signs show to go to, other by the restaurant. Disappointment is huge..",
          "Really enjoyed the visit to Crystal Worlds today. Some of the displays literally took our breath away. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Especially liked the chandelier of grief. The bus trip from Innsbruck is well worth the extra cost. Great day thanks",

          "We made the visit in the evening, so ticket can be booked in advance, no queue, few people (in some rooms we were alone, which is great to enjoy it). The garden is beautifull, and the different rooms inside are really surprising. It is very worth the visit.",
          "The chambers were beautiful and it was really nice to spend there a couple of hours, however, sometimes the orientation between chambers wasn\u2019t entirely clear, I think that we skipped something and couldn\u2019t easily return. The garden is spactacular!",

          "Definitely an interesting 1/2 day trip from Innsbruck. The crystal world tour is OK. Not my thing but if you like crystal then you would find it interesting. The English commentary is all about marketing the Swarovski brand. There's a HUGE crystal store at the end of the",

          "I visited Kristallwelt for the second time after being deeply disappointed when I visited several years ago. It was a very wet day and my husband had never been so we agreed to a day out. First off, this is NOT centred around crystal-making (which I expected the first time).",
          "Me and my friends had a great time at crystal world. The museum was amazing! Museum had an audio guide that came in multiple languages to guide you through the museum. Great for all age groups and amazing art for every generation to enjoy. I also enjoyed the live performances",
          "I found my trip to Kristallwelten disappointing. I\u2019m not sure what I expected, but it was more than I found. We went into the cave behind the giant first and moved through a series of modern art displays using crystals. We\u2019re not into modern art, so except for finding them",

          "A nice and interesting museum. It is more of an art museum than a productuin or history tour. I'm not sure if it will hold the interest of kids for long. It could have been less artistic and more realistic.",
          "Total waste of time Not even one exhibit was interesting. The children's play area was good I was expecting something like colourful crystals and some beautiful characters creates with crystals. This was a total waste. The chandelier room was very hyped. Finally just one",
          "Ticked of my bucket list. Wasn\u2019t disappointed. What a fabulous place Swarovski is. They thought about the whole family. Museum and gardens are stunning as are the views. Children loved the play tower. Great day out and reasonably priced for admission. Just a few thingsI would",
          "This is definitely a different kind of museum. Takes you through a list if displays of crystals in different styles of art and displays. Maintained well. Has some steps and you have to go up and down so watch out in the slightly dim light as you move around. Museum staff gives",
          "Great value for money with the sizeable location being an entourage of attractions as well as photo ops and an amazing interactive art gallery featuring some very modern installations. It is not as huge of a park as it seems like on the map and can be covered on foot pretty",
          "We were truly amazed at the displays in the gallery. It was not quite what we expected but maybe better than we thought it would be. This place is definitely worth seeing.",
          "This was amazing. Was so great to see some modern and edgy art after beginning to feel overloaded with history in this gorgeous city. The kids loved it as much as us adults.",
          "This visit is absolutely not worth it. Tourist trap, you do the whole thing in 30 minutes and the day we went the restaurant was closed!",
          "Visited the Swarovski Crystal World and my what an experience, I was totally overwhelmed, the Giant and each Chamber that you enter is amazing. The Crystal Cloud and Mirror Pool together with the Igloo are unbelievable. To finish off a visit the Daniel Swarovski restaurant is",
          "The art part inside the museum and in the park is really great, much better than what the brand sells as jewels and stuff : that's contemporary art at its best, I was really surprised. Th art experience is immersive, making it interesting for people who are not particularly",
          "A visit worth the time and money. It was a different world, full of crystals all around you, in different sizes, forms, themes. Beautiful, aesthetic. Probably the largest collection of crystals at one place. The place has the world's largest man-made crystal",
          "Enter the world of crystals by Swarovski. A great experience. About 25-30 minutes from Innsbruck station (Hauptbahnof). The tour purchased from Get your guide was really good with to and fro coach, Swarovski tickets.",
          "The Swarovski world was great. Something different than I know and expect. A totally new dimension for me - the art. I recommend to visit on sunny day otherwise the crystals outside have nothing to reflect ;-)",
          "I've been here once and I was awestruck the moment I got here. An excellent place to visit with friends and family especially if you are a Swarovski fan. You'll be spending atleast half-day here.",
          "We only went as it was part of our Innsbruck Card but we were glad we went. It was something very different to the usual and quite interesting. There were some quirky exhibits and some pretty cool things to see. The outside grounds were beautiful and it was nice to walk around.",
          "This is a very specific art museum. Very impressive! It has on display lots of crystals-small and huge ones. Also, the shop at the end offers huge number of their products. Worth mentioning is that they provide transportation from Innsbruck to the \"World\". We too the bus from",
          "We visited the Kristallwelten mid-February, when they have their special lightshows during the evening time, which are just an amazing thing to behold. Apart from that, there are many exhibitions and art pieces to explore for several hours. All in all, you get an experience that",
          "We enjoyed our time at Crystal Worlds from the wondrous exhibits to the interactive aspects of the chambers. It was something unique and enjoyable. But what really stood out was the staff, especially the two ladies at the welcome gate (by the fire). They were so sweet and",
          "Yes. That\u2019s how I would call it. I had a wonderful morning visiting the Swarovski Crystal World with the Special Private Tour today. It was heavily snow this few days(you know the weather in Europe in Feb, especially this year 2019) and our tour guide Amir suggested us to",
          "It was great amazing lighting effect inside the Giants head and those effects for the lights and those music are Sync.",
          "The exhibit is ok but not worth the price certainly if you know that the orice of the shuttlebus from Innsbruck is n\u00f3t included. The two of us paid \u20ac57,- in total. For comparison: the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has the same entrance fee (\u20ac19,-). The shop is, unfortunately,only",
          "Worth of visit when you are in Innsbruck, magical place ideal for kids as well, very nice playground, restaurant and large shop with fantastic service. If visiting in winter you need to go early hours because is getting dark fast which could affect your visit - there is a lot",

          "Beautiful place for lovers of Swarovski. It's Swarowski shop and museum. There is a small cafe inside. I know that the design is changing every year. I've been to New Year's Eve. It's very cool place but the price of the museum is a bit high. I don't know if it's worth but if",
          "We start the trip to the place without to know what we will see. As soon we get in our heart was surprised. It is very nice and very beautiful place. At the end we have opportunity to buy Swarovski jewelry. We recommend to visit this place.",
          "I probably wouldn't have taken a 25-minute coach ride to visit a giant factory shop mixed with an art exhibit, but I am glad it was included in the Innsbruck Card, and I decided to check this one out, because this place is Crazy! Swarovski is not hurting for money, so they have",
          "We visited the Swarovski Crystal World on the 5th January 2019 during the heavy snow storm and were pleases that the access roads were kept gritted and free.With regards to the Cristal World itself it's not what we have expected. We thought it would be more like a factory tour,",
          "This place was very interesting and the gardens were decorated for Christmas which made it even better. The restaurant was good and had a variety on the menu",
          "It definitely deserves a visit but is a little over-priced. The exhibition rooms are pretty small and it is no fun to visit when the place is crowdy and you can only enter once with the ticket you purchase (why not adopt a system that allows otherwise). There should have been",
          "Travelled down from Germany as it was open on a Sunday and wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. The outside exhibits are good to look at and the restaurant gave us a decent meal at a reasonable price - for Austria. The attractions inside were fascinating and each room offered a well",
          "I had been here for the 3rd time, unfortunately in foggy weather, so the garden wasn't so brilliant, but next time \ud83d\ude0a I really loved the magnificent new chamber Chandelier of grief, it is truly fantastic and a bit futuristic. Also got some awesome new brilliant things for my",
          "We have travelled a lot to visit the Crystal World, however the place was more likely a disappointment. When purchasing the tickets, the queue is outside, so you will be cold until getting them. Then the restaurant opens at 14:00!!!! In the area, you can only get fries or cold",
          "a fantastic experience. we found ourselves immersed in a fairy world. the rooms are many and varied, some really impressive. recommended",
          "Service @Daniels Restaurant not friendly and feel not enjoy there, please increasing the service, food nice",
          "It was incredible. Light and sound brought me in a fantastic world. Choose a day or an hour with no crowd and it will be an unforgettable experience.",
          "Fantastic Place, well worth going too. Even keeps the attention of men that are not interested in crystal. Displays are amazing. Staff are helpful and friendly. Shop staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. Worthwhile to allow about 2 - 3 hours.",
          "A beautiful spot. Unfortunately we visited on a rainy winters day so much of the garden was too wet to walk through. However the crystal art exhibits inside the \u2018cave\u2019 were interesting, all very different and unexpected in how they were presented. Snack options were limited with",
          "Challenging to get to via bus. The vast majority of personnel were manning the sales counters. Had to wait in line to buy a ticket as there was only one person in the ticket booth. Bathrooms are in an obscure location and challenging to find, albeit they are definitely",
          "Not worth the visit even if part of Innsbruck card...and that\u2019s from a collector. Boring day. Trapped by infrequent shuttle buses, restaurant closed AND prices higher than you get online!",
          "Easy to get to on shuttle bus from city centre. beautiful surroundings. Walking through the displays was amazing if a bit claustrophobic. The shop at the end was a highlight. Prices were about 30% cheaper than Australia. The lake and man's face were beautiful as were the crystal",
          "We used the Innsbruck Card for this visit, we boarded the shuttle at the Congress stop, we had to stand for the journey. Would therefore recommend travellers to start from the train station. You have to obtain a ticket at the attraction to enter, (this is not clear prior to",
          "Amazing museum! Well organized and maintained. Extra gift for a purchase in the shop. A lot of photo material!",
          "I had expected a dull museum telling the history of Swarovski crystal ornaments. This was NOTHING like that. An hour well spent looking at modern arts and displays full of Swarovski crystals from tee shirts to bras and from giant displays of animations to a crystal forest.",
          "We saw the crystal worlds tour advertised a lot of places and noticed that we had free travel and entry to there with our Innsbruck cards. It was a great way to spend the afternoon. Some amazing pieces of artwork along with lovely grounds to walk around. We also stopped at",

          "I\u2019m a chap who doesn\u2019t do bling and was expecting to displays of boring jewellery. But the visit was something else, the many exhibitions are thought provoking, witty, emotional, sad, joyful, funny and out of this world. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t have time for the gardens or",
          "Highly recommended for all travellers to Wattens and Austria.. The world of crystals come alive in this place,, also the areas surrounding the Crystal World is lush green and it makes the experience all the more charming..",
          "This was a world of it's own. Even if you're not too fancy of Swarovski crystals, I would still recommend anyone to go. Such a cute and magical place, and visitors also get 10% off when purchasing something from their shop :)",
          "It was a good trip here. Nice display of crystals. They even had a swavrovski crystal Taj Mahal for display. The location where this is set is very beautiful",
          "Didn\u2019t really know what to expect - but whatever we imagined it wasn\u2019t on the scale of crystal worlds! Each room, display or installation amazed us. Interesting multi-language information boards, giving details of the designers and number of crystals. Crystal clouds installation",
          "It's a good stop when you are close to Innsbruck. I'm not in to the art show inside so much but the waterfalls, the cloud the crystal ring display outdoor are quite amazing. Overall worth a visit and spend good 2-3 hours there.",
          "I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of Swarovski. I like jewellery, but nothing very blingy. I thought this Swarovski museum might be a touristic attraction with the principal aim to push gift shop purchases. Surprisingly, it wasn\u2019t, and actually, it was really rather magical! Most of",
          "You don\u2019t have to love jewellery to be impressed by this amazing place. The displays are fantastic, loved the musical fountain. The grotto is a big surprise.",
          "I just got so inspired by the glass crystals and the works of art. I would really recommend visiting this atleast once in your life.",
          "Beautiful crystals with a particular designs. Every corner has a concept. Each rooms has a different style and lights. You can see everything for 2 hrs. Include the garden. The most big shop in the world for me.",
          "We did the self tour here today and thought it was a good way to spend the morning. We went early and barely any tourists but by the time we left, the parking lots were filling up. Kind of a strange exhibit, but interesting. Really enjoyed the end with the history of the",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here as we were in the area. The highlight was definitely the interactive 'museum' with all the themed displays - our kids loved it too. The crystal forest and playgrounds/labyrinth were also very well done!",
          "Just a short distance from Innsbruck. Highly recommend to spend time there at least 3 hours, sit and relax in the garden, having some cakes and coffee then see the exhibits. Lastly, souvenirs!",
          "This is the last tour of our 5 week holiday and w absolutely love it, the displays are fine just like the jewel. we also experienced great customer service and friendliness from whoever approached us. Thank you we enjoyed the time spent here",
          "Frankly speaking, after reading other reviews and visiting the web-page I expected more than just a couple of dark rooms with weird colorful installations and weak visual performances. The highlight of the tour was a huge shop at the end, but, surely, that was not worth the 19",
          "We visited Crystal World while stying in Tirol. Our 3 years old doughter had lots of fun in the park & play tower. The location is great. We also made some shopping \ud83d\ude09 and ate at the restaurant. Staff was very nice& helpfull.",
          "We took the shuttle from Innsbruck for 19\u20ac and paid 19\u20ac each for tickets to enter Crystal Worlds. It takes about an hour to walk thru the exhibit and you are left in the gift shop for an hour before the shuttle returns to Innsbruck. It's interesting but it seems that I am",

          "Try to visit Swarovski World on your own. We visited with a tour operator and the visit was too rushed. You need at least 3 hours to explore the museum, grounds and shop properly. The museum exhibits were really well done - lots of different themed exhibits that brilliantly",

          "We visited because we had the Silbercard plus which meant we had free entry. If we had had to pay (19\u20ac each) we would have been extremely disappointed and felt that we had been completely ripped off. If you like wacky art and are able to interpret some of the exhibits then this",
          "Mostly large installtions with lots of crystals. Some have some artistic value, and some are just really colourful and splashy with little taste... I think 19eur is a little overpriced considering its main purpose to promote the Swarovski brand. There is a good restaurant",
          "Situated in Wattens within easy distance of Innsbruck, this is really worth a visit . Make sure you have the guided tour which lasts about half an hour and describes the history of the family who started this . You are then on your own as you walk through numerous gobsmacking",

          "Definitely worth a visit. Some of the crystal chambers are absolutely fantastic, some are more average, but that's just like in any museum. The gardens are breathtaking, you can easily spend a few hours there and enjoy the beauty.",

          "They have some pretty unique exhibits, not all of which are specifically related to jewellery. Some very peculiar crystal combinations. There's a 10 ft dome made of crystal into which you can walk. The Taj Mahal, Pyramids, Empire state building made up of swarovski crystals",
          "I read some reviews before arriving in Austria and thought I wouldn't like it as it was weird ! However, following a visit to the Swarovski shop in Innsbruck,which is also worth a visit, we decided to go, and didn't regret it. Even my 14 year old son enjoyed it!",
          "Amazing place of crystal theme, At the entrance the display of Chetak horse was very impressive. Many theme and mood based concepts enthrall the visitor throughout, it is really worth visiting. Time will just fly. Maintenance and display of each theme is superb. At the end",
          "I really can\u2019t understand why this is one of Austria\u2019s most visited attractions. Yes the exhibits were nice but it felt like we were at an art instillation exhibition. There was zero information about how they make crystals or how they became the go to name for crystals so it",

          "The exhibition \"The enchanted garden\" is a magic setting, especially for children. I enjoyed some of the displays, but found others irritating. I have to say that Swarovski has got some of the best advertising strategies I have ever come across.",
          "There is a shuttle bus to/from Innsbruck train station or taxi ride is ~ 30 Euros. There also is a train stop in Wattens, Austria close to Swarovski we could have used vs Innsbruck. Museum is magnificent. Gift shop has both pricey and some reasonable items for sale. You'll",
          "I visit the crystal world only because it was free with the Innsbruck Card. (i found the price of 19 euros a bit overpriced + 9.5 for the bus if you dont have your own car). It is a well-cared garden (the waterfall is nice for some photos). The rooms inside are a modern art",
          "The shuttle bus, despite being terribly expensive is quite useful, the problem is that it will not bring you to an amazing museum, it will leave you in a swindle which is a continuous taunt to the consumer. Starting with the ticket's price and following with the lie of the giant",

          "For fans of Swarovski\u2019s products (and there are many judging from visitor numbers) then this much crystal in one place is a significant draw. For those less interested, the emphasis on selling you its products (the shop must be the single largest indoor area) is off-putting and",
          "A little out of the centre, this speciality museum has free parking or a shuttle bus (costing 9.50euros from innsbruck). Entry price for an adult is 19 euros but we had the Innsbruck card (which I highly recommend if you're seeing a few things in Innsbruck) and this includes",
          "I did not know what to expect when I came here but I was absolutely amazed by the place. There are so many different areas with different themes and something for everyone. In one area there is a screen which played a piece of music and I won't spoil it but was utterly",
          "This museum is relatively expensive and you get nothing for your money. You go into rooms that basically show you clothes and other ornaments using crystals. It\u2019s a huge sales job. There is nothing interesting or informative at all. Of course, you empty out into the big shop.",
          "If you've had your fill of Innsbruck\u2019s lovely old-world charm and stunning mountain backdrops and you're really after something to do not far from town, and crystals are your thing, then sure, give Swarovski a go. It's not a terrible way to kill an hour, but it would be pretty",
          "Any woman's dream. For anyone who loves crystals this park is a must see. Very comfortable ride from the city center with their own bus that also offers wifi while transferring. The magic of the crystal museum makes it a fabulous place to visit and a great day. The wide variety",

          "Don\u2019t miss it if you are close to Salzburg Munich or Innsbruck - a visit to be mesmerized on ! Loved it and kids enjoyed ! So worth going",
          "The bus driver tried to rip us off on our way there. We should have got off and aborted mission then! The Crystal World was boring and tacky. You don\u2019t learn anything. There was no there, there. Save your money and time for the beautiful offerings of Innsbruck.",
          "I was there in the month of May 2018 with group. The location of the attraction is near to the Innsbruck, Austria. In the Crystal World one can have a look to various model/art made out of crystals. It is something new see. The World's biggest Crystal is displayed. Worth seen.",
          "The museum there has good collection of crystals. The park and children's plany area is also quite nice. Although we had opted for the free guided tour of the museum, it is perfectly fine to do the museum tour on your own. It is a nice place to visit if you are visiting",
          "The Swarovski crystal world hits you like a ton of bricks. Reaching there from Innsbruck is super convenient by one nof their shuttles that run through the day. Once you reach there, there are 2 parts to the experience. One is a garden and the other the main part experience. The",

          "On the plus side they do offer free internet and activities for kinder. However, I feel like the exhibits are static, so the \u20ac19 entry fee is a little high especially since they will take your money at the gift and souvenir shop. Nice to see once in your life.",
          "I have been deeply impressed by the place. It portrays the Swarovsky business as a truly successful empire. The visit has generated emotional experience, which has made me fallen in love with Swarovsky kristals. My wife and daughters were able to find kristals to their tastes.",
          "For the money paid, it is not worth visiting. The place is just an exhibition of the crystal which can be seen online or from any of their outlets. Travellers please do not pre book your tickets as you get a good discount if you buy after showing your Salzburg card.",
          "We were traveling with a kid and one of my planning rules was to not take him to places that would leave him bored and cranky, in addition to not disturbing the experience of the other visitors. I had my doubts with the Swarovski museum but the innovative exhibitions were more",

          "First i have to admit, I am not a fan of crystal, I used my innsbruck card to get to the Swarovski Crystal Worlds. There are total like 5 trips per day via the shuttle bus from Innsbruck. We took a 12.40pm bus from Innsbruck and probably reached Wattens around 1pm. We finished",

          "This was our second visit to Swarovski Crystal World. It has been remodeled since the last time we were here. We chose not to do the Museum because it's pricey, so we got free tickets to visit the displays and the store. There is a small sculpture garden outside and if you",
          "I have been a guest at the Crystalworlds on many occasions either with family or friends and each visit unravels something new. As I am someone who likes good deals - it's important to note that for frequent visitors(yearly cards are available) and it's turns out to be alot",
          "It was about a 30 minute bus ride to get there and 19 euros at the ticket booth. The museum was questionable. No cute picture spots and the store was so packed from tour bus guest that it wasn\u2019t enjoyable. Would not recommended.",
          "We went to Swarovski crystal words having fancy imagination about the place but were severely disappointed. If you are headed there, just roam in the garden, click a few pics and get out. The crystal world tickets are 19 euros pp and what's inside is not something you want to",
          "If you are near the vicinity of Innsbruck, make this trip!! even though i am not a fan of crystals, I liked their display in museum and collection. The location of crystal world is amazing surrounded by nature and greenery. The displays were good within the museum and display",
          "This is not a showcase of fluted crystal glass. It is more of an entertainment experience as it has unique displays such as the world's largest cut Crystal, an enyertaining playground for kids small and big, some incredible crystal art works, a serene pool of reflection and some",
          "This is a crystal work complex, many beautiful crystal article are on display and for sale. This is Swarovski showroom, the outside beauty is also very photogenic. One can do shopping if he or she is fond of Swarovski.",

          "We were in innsbruck for a day and didn't plan to go to this place especially. We bought innsbruck card, the ride and tickets were covered in the same. We decided to take evening bus to the park. We were just in time for the lqst guided tour. The lady was very pleasant and",
          "Being a member of Swarovski for many years this was a bucket list item for me. We used our Innsbruck card to catch the shuttle bus near 5r old town to get there. We also accessed the exhibitions with our Innsbruck card. We arrived in time for a quick English tour which gave us",

          "Museum is full of wonders made in Crystal. There are several marvels on display and I guess they do change this from time to time. The crystal cloud was spectacular since it was a bright sunny day and it emitted multitude of colours.",
          "Everytime that we come to back to Austria we have to visit the Swarovski factory, just love it here, its not cheap, but worth the money especially in the shop!, its an awesome place to see with its individual rooms, and sometimes weird exhibits and of course the crystal dome,",
          "This was a big disappointment. The employees have a bit of an attitude. The \"art gallery\" is an overload on the senses. Every space had a new smell, sound and visual stimuli. It was too much. The store was full of jewelry. We were hoping for more crystal figurines and did not",
          "This has something for everyone: those who love art, modern design, science, theather and even opera! Each room is a complete surprise. It is not a tourist trap - it is a celebration of what man can do with a crystal in the design concept. Loved it!",
          "On vacation with family, who wanted to visit. After the first time going, the second time was not that exciting. Pretty much the only reason I\u2019m writing this is to help others with getting there. If you are staying in the old city in Innsbruck, you DO NOT need to get the",

          "Unless you are really really really into modern art AND Swarovski, just don't bother, you'll be disappointed. For modern art lovers, the installations will be acceptable (even if the entrance fee is far far too high), but the whole point of it all is to get you into a Swarovski",
          "My family and I were very disappointed with this place. First off the fountain looks Nothing like it does in pictures, it\u2019s tiny, not green, and we were very disappointed. Second, tickets were pricy for what you get out of it. Third, it was very cold when we were informed it was",
          "Did not know what to expect before going here. But what you see is amazing and quirky. It is all art with Swarovsky and beautifully installed in a building with nice spotlights on the artworks in darker rooms. The design of how you walk through the building is well done too!",

          "Interesting place to visit. It had lots of interesting displays made with the crystals. At the very end of the tour, there is a store, which is bigger than the entire museum. Scenic location, and a good bucketlist place to add and check off.",
          "To be fair if you can go when it is dark it will be better, the lightshows are non-existent in the early evening. The galleries under the giants head are interesting but that's about it, unless of course you want to by expensive crystals from the very large store. Add the price",
          "This needs to be experienced. A completely different dimension, another world, one big fairy tale. For days I was under the impression after visiting this place. There are many rooms and each has its own story. Get in from one to the other. You do not think you're on the planet",

          "Took the family mostly because we liked the look of the play area when we drove past. Most of the areas we wanted to visit were closed, which was a shame. The play area was decent, but not as amazing as I was hoping. The exhibition was very very odd in some parts, and brilliant",

          "Apart from the awesome shopping you can do here as they have all of their products from around the world in one place, the museum is quite quirky. They change them regularly. If you have time in Innsbruck it is a good place to venture out to. I wouldn't recommend doing a tour.",
          "I went because I was with a tour group and it was in the program. The entrance is quite nice, but inside nothing special. I see it just as a shop in glamour. They just want to sell their products and advertise in style. I certainly would not go there again or recommend to my",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Hungerburgbahn is a hybrid funicular railway in Innsbruck, Austria, connecting the city district of Hungerburg with the city centre. The current line opened on 1  December 2007, replacing a previous alignment that operated from 1906 to 2005. The new Hungerburgbahn is one of the landmarks of the city, with stations designed by Zaha Hadid, and built by Leitner AG.\n\n\n== Current Line ==\n\nThe new Hungerburgbahn was put into operation in December 2007, after two years of construction. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid, who had already planned the Bergisel ski jump in Innsbruck, won an open competition to design the stations for the line. The project was financed and implemented as a public private partnership between the city of Innsbruck, STRABAG and Leitner AG. The company will operate the train for a limited time, after which the infrastructure and operations return to the municipality.\nThe new Hungerburgbahn is unusual for a funicular in that, although it does not reach the maximum gradient of its former incarnation, it experiences rapidly changing inclination both during the course of the route and at the various stops, transitioning between a relatively flat southern section (with ramps leading in and out of the two tunnels on either side of the river crossing), and a steeply inclined northern section more typical of a funicular. The line has an overall rise of 288 m (944.9 ft).\nThe line is single-tracked except for a passing loop at the midpoint. At the lower end, the route begins underground at Kongresshaus station at the eastern end of the Kongresshaus (a conference and concert venue) in the city centre, then runs beneath local streets in a 371.5 m long single-track tunnel before surfacing immediately south of L\u00f6wenhaus intermediate station. The line crosses the Inn on a 242 m long S-shaped cable-stayed steel bridge with two pylons, follows the north bank of the river in the St. Nikolaus neighbourhood, then descends into the 445 m long Weiherburg tunnel. The tunnel includes the midpoint of the route, and thus the passing loop. North of the passing loop, and while still in the tunnel, the line changes character from the relatively level southern portion, to the steeply inclined northern portion. The line rises sharply from the tunnel and follows a curved alignment, stopping at the Alpenzoo intermediate station, and crossing a 462 m long reinforced concrete bridge. The new route joins the old route for the final 100 m of the ascent to the upper terminus at Hungerburg station.\nThe line is mainly used for tourism, including from the Kongresshaus adjacent to the eponymous Kongresshaus station, and from the Nordkette ski area, which is accessible via the Nordkette Cable Car from the square opposite Hungerburg station. The line has relatively lower utility as a commuting route, as its upper station is located at the far eastern end of the Hungerburg district, away from most housing estates. At the lower end, the line terminates in an area containing the Kongresshaus convention centre, parking garages, bus parking, and part of the University of Innsbruck grounds. However, it is isolated by over 800 m from Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the city's main railway station, with the gap bridged by city bus lines.\nThe city of Innsbruck finances additional off-peak hours, and normal transport network core zone tickets (monthly, half-yearly and annual) are accepted as valid payment.\n\n\n=== Vehicles ===\n\nGiven the extreme change in gradient between the southern and northern sections of the line, Leitner AG designed the line's two funicular cars to each hold five smaller passenger compartments, suspended in a common frame. The inclination of these compartments is actively adjusted by a motor along the course of the route such that the floors remain horizontal throughout the trip. The two 130-person vehicles each have a transport capacity of 1,200 people per hour and direction. The outer frames of both cars are painted silver. The five individual compartments of Car No. 1 are painted yellow, while those of Car No. 2 are painted blue.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThe decision by city leadership to implement the new project was the object of heavy criticism by citizens' initiatives and the city's political opposition. A referendum on the future of the Hungerburgbahn had been demanded by a variety of groups opposed to the project, but the demand was not met. The formerly historically listed railway was to be preserved as a symbol of the city of Innsbruck just a few weeks before its 100th anniversary of service, and last-minute demolition was to be prevented. There was also criticism of the planned de facto privatization of the railway as part of the new construction project and associated fears that fares could rise significantly.\nAs a result of the controversy, the groundbreaking for the new rail project had to be carried out under police protection. December 8, 2005 was abruptly set as the last day of operation of the old Hungerburgbahn, with staff forbidden from holding hold farewell celebrations or from informing the public about the end of operations.\n\n\n== Former Line ==\nThe Hungerburg district was founded by Sebastian Kandler at the turn of the 20th century as a tourist centre. The first Hungerburgbahn was developed by engineer Joseph Riehl to serve the new district, and entered service on September 12, 1906. Together with the Nordkette Cable Car, the Hungerburgbahn opened up the Nordkette (including Seegrube and the Hafelekar) to skiing and other recreational use, and additionally provided public transport from the higher residential areas of the Hungerburg to the city centre.\nThe lower station was situated in the city district of Saggen, near the southern bank of the Inn river. From there the line ascended steeply, crossing the river on a sloped steel truss bridge, and proceeding on a straight alignment up to the Hungerburg district. The length of the track was 839 m and the rise was 287 m, with the steepest section of the line inclined at a 48.7% gradient.\nThe line was built to 1000 mm gauge, and used rails of the Stanserhorn wedge-head format. Up to 92 people could be transported per cabin, at driving speeds of 4 m/s or 2.5 m/s. With the original AC motor from 1906, the journey took 11 minutes, and 300 people could be transported per hour. In 1957/58 the railway was completely overhauled; the longitudinal profile in the upper part of the route was corrected and the old drive was replaced by a new drive of 190 kW.\nOn July 31, 1987, Alpenzoo Station was opened to serve the nearby Alpine zoo. This stop was slightly below the midpoint of the route, meaning that while the lower car served the station, the higher car (being attached to the same cable) was forced to wait above the passing loop.\nSince the original Hungerburgbahn's closure, the base station of the old line has been preserved, including a rotunda that housed the Innsbruck Giant Circular Painting from the line's opening until the artwork was relocated in 2010. The \u201cTalstation\u201d cultural centre and event space (litterally translated, \"Valley Station\") occupy the building. In addition to office and seminar rooms for young Innsbruck clubs and initiatives, it also offers a bar, a band room and a photo laboratory. The former departure hall has been converted into an event hall that can hold 250 people, and is used for theatre, concerts, discussions and film lectures.\nOf the former alignment, only about 100 m at the upper end of the line including Hungerburg Station remains in use as part of the current line. Other remnants of the old line still exist, including the iconic steel truss bridge over the Inn river (see photos of the line while in operation), and a 160 m long stamped concrete viaduct between the former Alpenzoo station (now relocated on the new line) and Hungerburg station. Both bridges are heritage listed. Most of the track systems have now been dismantled and the rest of the former route has largely grown over, but is still clearly visible.\n\n\n=== Images ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to the New Hungerburgbahn at Wikimedia Commons\n Media related to the Old Hungerburgbahn at Wikimedia Commons\nThe Hungerburgbahn at the Gondola Project\n Hungerburgbahn Innsbruck on YouTube\n Driver's Cab Perspective (from 4:20) on YouTube\n Part 1 of the Hungerburgbahn, filmed in 2009 on YouTube\n Part 2 of the Hungerburgbahn, filmed in 2009 on YouTube",

          "Beautiful views. The cable cars are very crowded though. But always wonderful views from the tops of the mountains.",
          "Took my dad to Austria for a couple of days we were recommended to go on the cable car to the top of innsbruck. The day we went ways clear blue sky and loads of sunshine, and not very busy. The trip is highly recommended and the views were stunning at this time of year there",
          "We rode the funicular from Innsbruck, close to the hofgarten and Congress building. The stations in Innsbruck and Hunderburg are easy to spot with their interesting cloud-like roofs. The Innsbruck pass covers a single return ride on the funicular and the cable cars further up if",
          "Only takes around 8 minutes and is 9 euros per person return. Great views from the station at the top.",
          "As a big Zaha Hadid fan I had to ride the Hungerburg funicular. It is modern, the nations are beautiful design and it is easy to get on right in the middle of Innsbruck. At the end of the ride you transfer to the cablecar go up the Nordkette.",
          "Loved every second, on a trip that takes you to the top of the mountain I did not expect to go down underground first lol. Beautiful modern pods, interesting not like your usual cable car trips. had to change a couple of stages which was interesting, great views at all stages.",
          "Reached by the Nordeketten fromInnsbruck town you can rreach this by cable car from the old town of Innsbruck. The views are spectacular from all three levels. Note - wear warm clothing and shows with good sole grip/tread if going to the glacier - it gets quite slippy",
          "Directly from Innsbruck Old Town, the funicular whisks you in minutes from valley level to a glorious viewing balcony in a tiny village, with direct connection from there to the higher mountain by nearby cable-car. The train is clean and modern; the staff are helpful and speak",
          "Though this may seem a bit pricey to get to the top, as you still get great views from Hungerburg which is more than half the price, the experience is fantastic and the views are well worth it!! Make sure you go on a clear day or you will waste your money, it was a little hazy",
          "With the Innsbruck card you can use the funicular for a return trip including the cable cars to the top of Innsbruck Well worth it in my opinion Cars are smooth and have a good tilting mechanism to keep the car level throughout the changing gradient",
          "Lovely Christmas Market up 3000 ft. Funicular costs around 19 euros and views of Innsbruck are breathtaking.",
          "We stayed near Old Innsbruck. Walking distance to everything. I would go back here is a minute. The people were delightful - countryside just spectacular!",
          "Great return trip to the 'Top of Innsbruck'. Furnicular to Lowenhaus, Alpen Zoo and Hungerburg and then cable car to Seegrube and Hafelekar. Lovely views of Innsbruck from Hungerburg, but then spectacular views from Seegrube and Hafelekar, especially if you're lucky enough, like",
          "For 10\u20ac a person (and about 45\u20ac to get to the top) there is absolutely nothing interesting in Hungerburg. There is a nice view but we took the Furnicular up to go to the Christmas market in Hungerburg and it was about 8 stalls. Nothing different from the ones below, it was such",
          "Great view for Hungerburgbahn across the entire town and other mountain ranges. Definitely make the journey up here. Instead of paying for the funicular we took the route J bus to Nordkette and it let us off right at the lookout point. The view was so good from this height we",
          "Great train ride with very steep gradients but worth every minute on the ride. Great views on the way up to the first cable car.",
          "The day we went up it was cloudy and rainy but we still had a great time with stops all along the way - including a great Alpine Zoo. And, at the top was the BEST cheesecake and coffee. This is a very efficient and fun way to climb the mountain. No problems at all.",
          "While we were initially disappointed that the cable car was cancelled on the day we chose to take the trip to the top of the mountain the next day the weather was perfect and the trip was very quick and well coordinated. The Nordkette Cable Car took us to Seegrubbe station then",
          "The funicular was nice but was going a lot slower than we thought it would. It has a couple of stops which makes the experience less exciting than if it would go all at once at the top. Last but not least the location shown in TripAdvisor is where it will take you and not where",
          "If you are in Innsbruck, you must take the cable car trip to the top of the mountain. A once in a lifetime experience. Stunning views!",
          "This is a fantastic ride up and down. Be warned--there's no A/C or even fans in the cars. It's stuffy and super hot if the temps are high!!! One of our teenagers nearly vomited from the trip and heat. Just be careful!",
          "Great views at the first stop. A little too cloudy to get much of a view at the top. Nice ride overall.",
          "This is our second ride within the past few years, this time with three young grandchildren, and we would definitely recommend it, despite the stiff price. The fact that the Innsbruck entrance to the funicular was a short walk from our hotel was a pleasant bonus. The remaining",
          "Just awesome incredible ride experience to the top of Innsbruck from the congress centre which is 10 mins from Innsbruck rail station. Can even do it all in a day trip from Vienna.",
          "The new funicular was packed with people all paying about \u00a326 each for a short ride to the cable car which was a large gondola also packed with people which took you to the top. Better value is going on the Patscherkofelbahnen on the opposite side of town which is cheaper with",
          "Its a cable car, and the view is great but the car was packed so I consider it mostly a quick and convenient way to get part way up the mountain from the city center.",
          "This is certainly one of the best tourist spot in Austria, View from the top is breathtaking. One can visit this place with friends or with family. One can easily spend one day to enjoy this unique experience.",
          "First observation point for Innsbruck city from the northern side. Approximately 900 m high (if my memory serves me right. Great view of Innsbruck town",
          "We booked this trip weeks in advance. The how to get to the boarding place was clear and a walk from the main station. The staff were not very helpful and treated you like cattle to get into the main car up the mountain. We waited 15 minutes for the next car and had loads of",
          "Took the cable car round-trip to top of Innsbruck. Great view. Had a good time. Did some hiking while up there and played in the snow. Good deal.",
          "Accessible by a short walk from the town center, the cable cars were frequently available, we never waited for more than a few minutes. While it was 90 degrees in town, it was cool and refreshing on top of the mountain. Good dining choices as well.",
          "This is a amazing view of the area. Make sure to go all the way to the top to see both sides. Hotels sell an Innsbruck card that will save money versus a la carte booking of the ride. Either way, this was the highlight of our trip and a must-do!",
          "The trip from downtown Insbruck to the top of the mountain includes a funicular ride (with two stops) to an observation platform, followed by two rides in a gondola-like car, taking you almost to the summit. It is worthwhile taking, even in the summer but the very top is quite",
          "A must do when in Innsbruck for the panoramic views, well set up with easy to enter and exit cable cars.",
          "Fantastic snow experience. You can walk up to the tip for better view if you dare. Very cold and fun.",
          "My 10 ye old was excited from the word go and this funicular lived up to its talk. The scenery was good and the experience was unique.",
          "The ride from Congress is easy to get to from anywhere within Innsbruck. A team takes you to the first lift. From there board this one to the top top. Once there walk the rest of the way to see the most amazing views. Simply breathtaking. Hint: buy an Innsbruck card. It\u2019s",
          "We travelled the Hungerburg funicular whilst in Innsbruck on our way up to the Nordketter funicular and it was an interesting ride which also gives access to the Alpine Zoo.",
          "This was part of our Innsbruck Card. It\u2019s. Smooth ride and we enjoyed it. It takes you to a small cute town halfway up the mountain. Great views as you go!",
          "This was a part of our Innsbruck Card pass and was a lovely ride up the mountain. The ride up consists of a funicular train to a small, charming town and coffee shop, then a cable card ride from there. You can hike a bit further up or enjoy the views at a cafe by the cable car",
          "This activity is a must. Really. If you didn\u2019t do it you might as well say you didn\u2019t go to Innsbruck. The view is INCREDIBLE. I advise you get the ticket online already with access to the 3 cable cars. Otherwise it\u2019s quite expensive. All stations have restaurants and nice",
          "You can\u2019t really go wrong with a funicular railway! We all enjoyed the ride up the mountain (stopping off at the zoo) and on to the cable car. We had the Innsbruck card which made it very cost effective.",
          "Great, smooth ride up to Hungerberg from Innsbruck with some really great views and dining in the area",
          "The trip up imvolves a short train ride, then switch to a cable car to part way and then switch to a second cable car for the final ascent. The view from the top is amazing. You can see mountains surrounding you everywhere. There is a short walk up from the cable car exit to the",
          "This is a fun way to take in an elevated view of the valley and city. Take a stroll around Hungerburg or stop for coffee at the cafe, (The hand made popsicles are delicious). Enjoy the view over the river Inn and the town from the viewing platform or continue up the",
          "Poor weather and low cloud on our visit made the cable car up Nordkette a bit of a waste of money as we wouldn\u2019t have been able to see anything, so instead decided to take the funicular to Hungerberg for fantastic views over Innsbruck. A round trip to Hungerberg is \u20ac9.50 at",
          "Fun way to get to Hungerburg - and some terrific views of Innsbruck. Just make sure when you're buying tickets at the bottom that you specify the Funicular rather than the Cable Car, because our attendant didn't ask.",
          "An amazing experience to be able to ride to the top in such ease and comfort! Great photo opportunity and yes it can be cold! But well worth the trip. Use the Innsbruck Card!",
          "We took this on our way up the Nordkette and I can see that it is a great way to get to the animal park, or even just to Hungerburg for a low-elevation view of the valley.",
          "A must when visiting Innsbruck if weather is fine. Great views over the city. Travel early to avoid the worst crowds.",
          "The ride in the funicular up the Nordkette to the Hungerburg viewing platform is fast and even from within, the view is wonderful - but just wait until you see the view from the top!",
          "From Congress to Hungerburg is only a short jump (albeit across the river). The little cable railway is an assembly of 5 or so individual cabins that are allowed to roll within the suspension frame so that the ride remains very comfortable even when there is quite a steep climb.",
          "We spent Christmas day at the top and we have an unforgettable experience. You can take the gondola all the way up from town!",
          "This is a must do when in Innsbruck. The views going up are amazing. We stopped at the zoo on the way up and as it was December there was a Christmas market once we reached the top at Hungerburg. Amazing views over the valley and Innsbruck. From here we got the cable car up to",
          "As you start your journey up the Nordkette you get to ride the Hungerburg Funicular. It is an amazing piece of engineering, the cog-wheel train being hauled up the mountain. It can be busy and the cars crowded at times, but it's fun and the way to the zoo too.",
          "Going down from Hungerburg in the morning the cars were nearly empty. But the lines going up appeared to be gathering size quickly. The funicular is a quick and easy way to travel part-way up the mountain. Returning from the old town we boarded at Congress Station and packed in",
          "Located not far from the center of town and the golden roof, you can follow the signs to get here. Then you can take the funiclar up to the viewing area. During Christmas time, there is a small Christmas market where you can enjoy a nice view over the city. You can buy a return",
          "The ride up was nice and the views were great. We met a nice family from Canada during our ride up to Seegrube.",
          "We used the funicular to visit the small Christmas market at the top station. It is a touch pricey but is quirky and offers excellent views across Innsbruck, particularly as on the beautiful day such as when we visit. As a bonus at the Christmas market is a stall that serves",
          "This funicular is a great way to get up to the Alpine Zoo and the higher stop at Hungerberg. At peak times though and on weekends it can get very busy and the carriages are rammed with people. Not great for those that don't like being shoved in a small space with lots of",
          "We used this on our way up and down to the Alpen zoo very good and efficient way to get to the cable car",
          "Dont miss the opportunity for anything . Just amazing views on the top. You will be mesmerised . Buy the Innsbruck Card (24H/48H) whatever suits your itinerary and it turns out to be cheaper that way",
          "This is a very pleasurable trip, but the next two levels are spectacular. Do it you won't be disappointed.",
          "Beautiful view with mountain animals roaming all over. Exciting cable car ride straight up and very fast. Enjoyed lunch in a magnificent setting",
          "Although I'm not good with heights, I felt very comfortable on this trip - both the funicular and the cable car. The ride was smooth and the views spectacular. A cup of gluhwein at the restaurant made the 25 minute wait for the return funicular very pleasant.",
          "This trip came as quite a surprise. To be transported from Innsbruck city centre to the top of nearby mountains at 2,256m with spectacular views. Even in September, there was snow on the tops of some nearby mountains. Surprisingly good restaurant at the Seegrube level.Plenty of",
          "You haven\u2019t been to Innsbruck if you haven\u2019t been up the mountain. Great views from the mountain in the city",
          "An unusual way of travelling but great fun. As it goes up or down the steep parts it sort of changes shape. Great views on the way up or down",
          "Very scenic ride I hiked up and took the tram and funicular down. A must do. You can go two more stops and find yourself high up in your mountains,",
          "While I do not like heights, I would still recommend taking this ride especially if you only have one chance to visit Innsbruck. Overall, the ride was a very smooth and worth the beautiful view. If you normally take precautions for ear pain when flying on an airplane (like",
          "Hungerburg Funicular is the best place to get the view of the whole city. its best to visit late evening to get the right view",
          "It\u2019s a bit confusing but this lift part of the Innsbruck Nordketten Bahnen (that\u2019s the mountain)- We drove to this on the GPS and too the lift to the top. We hiked a bit and thoroughly enjoyed the views. Breathtaking! Go!",
          "The view was absolutely beautiful and the entire experience another example of Austrian attention to detail/efficiency. We loved it!",
          "Great ride up the mountain but you must connect to cable cars after the second stop. It is not quite clear when you purchase tickets to the top that you must transfer out of the fancy tram and change to cable cars. Also beware that at the second stop after the zoo you must",
          "Just do it and you will understand why!! 30 euro per person is money well spent.. views views and more views !!! Have a Radler overlooking the Innsbruck landscapes.. wow factor 100",
          "The funicular is the little train that takes you up two levels to the Alpenzoo level. Then you have to take two other cable cars to get you to the peak. The funicular is a fun ride and you get a few decent views (sit near the back window on the way up) but it\u2019s not as cool as",
          "A fun experience with a pleasant view going up to Hungerburg. A bit crowded and over priced. We also hiked up to Hungerburg which was very pleasant. The day we rode the funicular up, we also took the cable car up to the top. Very nice. Always the cars were jammed - we were",
          "The funicular is fun and efficient. If you don't want to hike up to, it's a great option. There are lots of nice walking trails once you arrive at mid-station.",
          "Get up early to get clear fabulous views over Innsbruck. The first tram starts at 7.15 and you need to change two further times the last one only starts at 9! It gets pretty crowded after that time we went all the way to the top first and walked around and stopped at each",
          "Great views. Fast and efficient service. We enjoyed our trip up the mountain and stopped off at the alpenzoo. A cable car is available to take you up to the top of the Hungerburg.",
          "We started at Hungerburg, not the Congress station of the Nordkettenbahn, which is easily reached on the J bus. it was a clear day which made the hike to the Pfeish\u00fctte mountain hut along the Goetheweg trail quite wonderful. Trail is well marked with good footing (supplemented",
          "It is one of the greatest funicular railways I have ever seen, with a long line uphill. There is even a station to the alpine zoo, allowing to visit it easier. The view uphill is stunning. You definitely should!",
          "The view from this restaurant was great, service ok, food not so good, but hey, at this height, I would not question it.",
          "It moves like a caterpillar and travel to Hungerburg is non jerky. Amazing engineering. Try to take the last cubicle for better views. The frequency is about every 15 mins. The train stops at 2 more places. Out of them one is Alpenzoo. You may even travel by bus to Hungerburg",
          "We went fits thing on a Saturday and there were lots of locals going hiking. Good to see them using it and out and about. Easily purchased the tickets necessary to go to the top. Ride the funicular, then get on a cable car, and then another cable car to get to the top. Up top it",
          "A superb way to see the surrounding areas, quiet operation. easy access. Got a great view of the mountain below Highly recommend",
          "It's must, riding on a funicular. At least once. Nice views from funicle, when u go up and u go down (although, its a restricted view) but it's still worth.",
          "We paid 28 \u20ac to go to the top. With 4 persons quite expensive. You have the view what's amazing. I missed a planned walk with the children. Conclusion good, although I had bigger expectations.",
          "We travelled with this funicular to it's last stop and saw the beautiful stations and the view of the city. It is nice, just a short visit (in order to go up the mountain- one must change to cable cars).",
          "On a nice sunny day we took the ride from the Innsbruck Congress Centre to the Haflekar peak which is a combination of rides by funicular and then cable car . One has to change at Hungersberg which is a midway village with good views of the valley below . There one has to",
          "A cable railway with five pods which individually adjust for the gradient. Very smooth and I didn't struggle with it from a fear of heights perspective. You can get to the alpine zoo from the railway. Toilets and refreshments available at top and bottom.",
          "Oh wow! What an amazing trip to take. The cable car was smooth, providing stunning views of both Innsbruck and those who decided that hiking up the mountain was a better thing to do!111",
          "What a great view and good comfortable way to travel the mountain. But beware of the nudists sunbathing on the rocks below, she really was a big lady.",
          "Super efficient and modern transport takes you half way up the mountain where you change to a cable car two minutes away. This takes you up to near the top of the mountain where the is a restaurant with facilities etc. You could head off for a while from here, but highly",
          "We had purchased an \"Innsbruck Card' and used it to ride up to the Hafelekarhaus. You have a spectacular view of Innsbruck and the surrounding area from there. Well worth the ride!",
          "This was a great way to spend a couple of hours. We weren\u2019t sure what to expect as it was hard to get information locally but was spectacular. You jump onto a train like vehicle to do the first leg and then onto a funicular for the final run to the top. It\u2019s a glorious view",
          "We use this funicular from Hungerburg down to Congress. The train run every 15 minutes. Take the first wagon (the lowest one) to get better view of Innsbruck when the train runs :)",
          "This is a fun 5ing to do when in the area. The funicular is a great way to go up. I\u2019d recommend just for the views. Quite a lovely way to see so much.",
          "GO right upto the top. It is worth it. There are nice cafes at each junction. IF you are fond of hiking, return by road",
          "This is the best way to start your journey up the Nordkette. It offers some nice views on the way up, but it's not cheap. I'd say it's probably only worth doing if you're planning on going all the way up (taking the cable car afterwards), or if you have the Innsbruck Card. We",
          "A must trip for anyone visiting. After spending time up the mountain it\u2019s well worth getting a Funicular ticket for the final leg of the journey back down to Innsbruck. The station is really modern and minimal. Waiting times are short and the views are fabulous. Look out",
          "You've seen Zaha Hadid architecture, but have you ever ridden a cable car designed by her? Here's an opportunity.",
          "amazing experience, amazing design which is so special as are the places to start by the river and then the views from above on the other side---city and mountains, not to be missed at any age",
          "You could be taking this funicular to go to the top of mountain! Is very fast and the price is good too!",
          "This amazing feat of engineering is a joy to experience, and Zaha Hadid\u2019s beautiful architecture is the main event. Her stations blend with the surroundings, yet are still modern and quintessentially her style. An unmissable Innsbruck attraction.",
          "What an interesting trip this is never having been on a funicular before! Fascinated with how it worked. Lovely view from the top exit point. Definitely recommend to get an \u201cInnsbruck card\u201d if you plan to do this as it works out a lot cheaper and they are many other sights",
          "Whether you like engineering, scenery, or architecture - this will satisfy all three. Not to mention the convenience of being a 5 minute walk from the old town.",
          "This is an easy trip - even if the cable car going higher is closed due to weather, you can still likely take this and get a feel for life in the mountains around Innsbruck. Moderately priced and nice cafe once you arrive.",
          "Incredible view over Innsbruck and the Alps. One of the best views. Make sure you stop at the little bar between the Cable Car and the Gondola.",
          "The funicular alone is worth doing, but the views are incredible. We only went as far as Hungerburg, not to the top ski slopes, but well worth it",
          "We used our Innsbruck card to go up and did a short walk around Hungerburg. Not much there but wonderful views of the mountains and city below. There is a tiny cable car museum to see.",
          "The Hungerburg Funicular was a great experience to get up the mountain fast but when we came back down the tram was down with technical issues. But they had a bus to take you back to the Innsbruck Station. We used the Innsbruck card and the Funicular was included. There was a",
          "great day out from Innsbruck to top of Hungerburg, not a cheap day out but worth it. have been up twice in sun and another day in snow and cloud.this is free if you buy Innsbruck card . theres a shop and restaurants at both cable car stops. and a outside bar if the suns out.",
          "It was quite easy to buy the tickets and take the ride up the mountain. We basically followed the crowd to wait on the cars and load into each car. The ride was smooth and the views were excellent across Innsbrook.",
          "The Hungerburg Funicular is a great way to start your alpine scenery visit. You can have lunch in the town at the end of the line, stop off at the Alpenzoo or continue to the cable cars to reach the top.",
          "We usually go on a funicular when skiing, so this was a different experience but well worth while. First of all the architecture was interesting, and the views good. Unfortunately visibility at the top was poor but we used our time to go for a walk in the woods outside the",
          "It was very efficient and enabled us to make a few stops on the way to the cable car. If you want to experience great Austrian engineering whilst getting from the city to the cable car then this is the way to do it!",
          "Winter, with snow covering the trees, is a wonderful time to step aboard this smooth and very clever form of transport up the mountain to Hungerburg.",
          "Always an adventure,and a different perspective of Innsbruck. We really enjoyed the trip and getting off to walk around.Unfortunately there was,an avalanche so we couldn't go up further . A reason to return.",
          "There are few seats, but then again, it's not so bad, because they are so cold that you can develop a bladder infection during the trip. There is no heating whatsoever inside, and the doors are kept open for so long that you will be freezing, unless you are in full skiing",
          "Good trip on clear day. Magical with recent snow and small Xmas market.Better to go up to higher stops to see ski areas.",
          "Stunning views. Worth the trip. In awe of the architect, Zaha Hadid, who designed this. She also designed the Innsbruck Ski Jump. We were there and it was -7% and clear views back to Innsbruck and a panoramic view of the Alps. Would go Summer, Winter, Spring or Autumn as",
          "A must see attraction! Worth every penny. Suggest getting the innsbruck card which admission is included. You can take a second funicular to the summit of the mountain for more views.",
          "It is the station from which cable car to nardekottom starts. Beautifully buitl can be reqched by furnicular from congress station or by bus from city. Both cable car and furnicular is part of innsbruck pass",
          "4 Stations on yhis Funicular, all designed by Zaha Hadid. One way trip is approx. 5min, so definitely worth going for a ride just to experience the architecture of each station.",
          "I was looking forward to using this system as it is one of the most modern of it's type in the world, however on arrival at Congress station, we were told by a rather officious female that it had broken down and was out of use, if we were wanting to catch the cable car, ( very",
          "Worth the time and money, spectacular views of he alps, even more if you come prepared to hike. Nice cafe on top.",
          "It was really nice riding on this very modern funicular, you really get to see the nice city landscape out of it. The bad thing is that it was broken on our way down and were forced to get a taxi (the only alternative was the bus, but it was coming only rarely and it was OF",
          "We enjoyed several hours wandering around the peak, making use of the network of paths. Then we took the cable car down to the next station and explored some more. What a great day to spend a glorious summer's day.",
          "Great way to see all of Innsbruck from 300 meters above the city and a cool way to get there. This is just the funicular - not the gondola to the top.",
          "Lovely up the mountain with fabulous views. The Christmas Market here is tiny though. The markets in Innsbruck are great though.",
          "This is only a short trip but it is worth every cent. The stations were designed by architect Zaha Hadid and they are dramatic and inspiring. Teamed with the mechanical wonder of the funicular and the incredible views for the top, this is a spectacular short visit.",
          "Everything about Innsbruck is incredibly beautiful but to really appreciate the grandeur of the natural scenery it's essential to visit the Hafelekarspitze, which is the highest point accessible by the two tram lines that begin the ascent in Hungerburg. As one might expect the",
          "Gorgeous views, fresh air, well worth the trip! Had lunch at the little restaurant at the top, soup and hot wine were excellent. Several small trails to take for great panoramic views. We had a small child (10 months old) with us and she did great in a carrier, a stroller will",
          "The funicular is a great experience. It's only a short ride (4 stops?) but is great fun. The cars themselves are nice and clean and the Zaha Hadid-designed stations are spectacular. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",
          "The whole experience is beautiful, but it is worth the extra money to go to the last stop on the cable car.",
          "Went up to the highest but one stop. Fantastic view! Ride was brilliant although on the way up the cars were full to the brim! I was in the first car so the view was amazing of the funicular winding its way up! Cable cars were brilliant too! I met two visitors from Zurich and we",
          "You can take the Hungerburg funicular from the centre of Innsbruck and then connect with the Seegruber tram to the top of the Hafelekarspitz. If you're fit you can walked to the top of the mountain and take the lift all the way back to the City. The hike is about 5.5 hours up",
          "Easy to find and get tickets for the ride up to the alpine zoo. Views of the city great. Very efficient service. Combine this with the cable car trip to Nordkettenbahnen. Can buy a return ticket to the top or buy a combo ticket just to go to Hungerburg and the zoo",
          "We arrived in time for one of the last trips of the day. You may want to give yourself more time to explore the trails at the top of the mountain. We did not venture too far, but found the views were incredible. It is definitely worth going to the top!",
          "Amazing futuristic stations looking like they're from outer space! Quick and efficient with great views.",
          "The funicular is in the heart of Innsbruck and at a walk able distance from the golden dahl. It goes upto the Nordkette mountain with couple of stops in between. The views are amazing and one of the best thing to do in Innsbruck.",
          "The ride up is so beautiful. The view is unforgettable. A camera is a must to capture the scenes.Good walking shoes were our best companion.",
          "The Nordkettebahn is split into two parts, the Hungerburg funicular/cable car, and the Seerube gondola lift. The view is good from Hungerburg, but spectacular from Seegrube. There are restrooms and dining facilities at both. We stopped at Hungerburg, briefly on the way down,",
          "Using the Innsbruck Card to go to Alpenzoo then Hungerburg. Super views, smooth travel. Busy on way up at noon. Not bad on way back down about 3pm",
          "A must, lovely view, great occasion for enjoying the alps. We did all the way up to the top, and making a unique ticket it was quite a good price.",
          "Very interesting mode of transport up the mountain. The funicular offers great views across Innsbruck on the way up the mountain. In December a small Christmas market greets you at the top of the Funicular where you can enjoy a Gluhwein with a great view. All costs are covered",
          "This is not to be mixed up with the nordketten cable car which takes you up to 2269m overlooking Innsbruck. This funicular runs from City center (Congress) to the base station of the Nordketten cable car via Zoo. It is fully possible to skip the funicular and takes other",
          "We booked through Trip advisor in advance. The views were amazing. We had coffee at the coffee shop at 2100 feet",
          "Riding the funicular takes you to the top of the hill with such an amazing view of Innsbruck, Austria. You can also see the ski jump from the Innsbruck Olympics. Relax and enjoy the fresh air.",
          "Just a very nice trip up a mountain! Always impressive, this funicular, whether going just to the Zoo stop, the top station or on with the cable car to the VERY top (Hafelekar).",
          "Is you don't like heights, take the first section to the small town and have a beer. The view is Great! You can walk around town for a few minutes or take a hike or bike into the mountains. This could be a full day for hiking or biking. You can also drive; plenty of parking",
          "Yiu may start the journey is tunnel but you come out over a bridge across the river Inn and then it climbs steeply affording fabulous views. Worth doing in it's own right but having got as far as the Hungerburg it is worth doing the whole way up the Nordkette!",
          "Every fifteen minutes and is good fun, takes you to a place from here there is a cable car. View is picturesque.",
          "This is a really fun ride to take and it has three convenient stations. Be sure to sit in a location with a nice view (usually the last car)",
          "It is amazing being able to go up this beautiful mountain so easily! You experience modern technology that makes possible to be high in the mountain in such a short time. The view is espectacular! It is safe and an experience I highly recommend.",
          "This was an amazing trip. We originally experienced the funicular railway 30 years ago so to return and see the updated version was amazing. Well worth the time and money.",
          "so we rode this in July, we bought the tickets to go all the way up, paid 114 euro for a family of 5 , the weather up was foggy and extremely cold in the first stop (you will need winter clothes and shoes) , on our way up (few minutes) we saw nice views but because of the fog we",
          "The funicular starts near the old town and is a very convenient way to get to Hungerburg and also is the gateway to the cable cars that take you to the top of the mountain. A very clever engineering feat, smooth ride all the way up. You can buy an all inclusive ticket which",
          "We paid 28\u20ac for 4 seniors return tickets for the trip. The train goes from the centre of Innsbruck across the river and up the hill to Hungerberg. Each station is a work of art with scripted glass canopies. The train stops at the Alpine zoo. At Hungerberg there is a viewpoint",
          "The Hungerburg funicular takes a steep climb for a spectacular view of the city of Innsbruck. You can get down at the Alpenzoo to have an added view of the surroundings",
          "Great experience if you are visiting Innsbruck. The view is beautiful. We did not go to the peak as the ticket cost is very high. Moreover it was a cloudy day so we felt it was good enough to stop at hungerburg. It was early so there was no crowd and we enjoyed the view. There",
          "This was was a great attraction! We went 1st thing in the morning and it was a little overcast, but when it cleared up - WOW, what a view! We were the 1st at the top and it had snowed the night before. It was cold and slippery, but totally worth going up! Beautiful!",
          "One of the stops on the way up to the top of the mountain at Innsbruck. Nice stop for a lunch and view.",
          "We rode on the Hungerburg train enjoying the panorama and the spectacular views along the way. Its the same train to the Innsbruck Zoo. The architecture is absolutely amazing \ud83d\ude09. You must go there. Lovely relaxing atmosphere up there with breathtaking views of innsbruck. A must",
          "We went up the old funicular many years ago and had a bite at the restaurant at the top. This time we enjoyed the \"new\" funicular and could afford the two cable cars all the way to the top. Lots of people were hiking off on the trails. Dining options at the top of the cable",
          "We stayed for around 3 hours at hungerburg. Small restaurant serving good wines and awesome tap beer . Beautiful scenic everywhere. Take a walk upside towards the forest it's breath taking .",
          "This is the first ride through a small train to reach the first cable car... the stations are elegant and the ride itself is enjpyable...",
          "If you want breathtaking views and are not worried by heights this is for you.It was cold and very windy at the top with plenty of ice and snow there.May 21 we were there .",
          "There are 3-4 stations where one can get down and look around.The top provides wonderful panoramic view of hills and the city.the journey to the top is very enjoyable .It is a must do while in Innsbruck.",
          "If you go to Innsbruck, you must see the panorama from the top of the mountains. It is astonishing! We bought the ticket up to the Seegrube and enjoyed the amazing view from the city and the mountains. First, you take the funicular up to the Hungerburg station, with the",
          "To have tram stations adorned by Zaha Hadid's work is phenomenal. Her sculptures elevate the entire experience of being there. Yes, a bit of competition for the Alps. The tram to the top of Nordkette is perfect. I will do it again and again: Innsbruck and the views are worth it.",
          "We arrived mid afternoon and had time to go up 2 stops to the top of the funicular where you change for the cable car. This cost just 8 euros and gave a great view of city.",
          "Somehow we didn't realize this possibility because we were visiting for professional reasons. But the locals advised to do it, and we were really thrilled by the experience, particularly by the thought that it is in fact possible to ski from the top (deadly, if you ask me). I",
          "Fast, efficient and comfortable. Fascinating to watch the carriages 'split' to keep each car level. The funicular runs every 15 minutes, so if one is missed, it's no hardship to wait for the next.",
          "I got it wrong, this is the attraction we went and not the Nordtherbarken. Sorry about that. But tis Funicular was spectacular, we got to see the snow with my wife. It has 3 stops, one where you can step down and get a nice view of the city. The next stop we got to see some",
          "We boarded the funicular as a means of getting up the mountain and it was ridiculously busy and comparable to a London Tube train at rush hour. BUT once it got moving it was so much fun zooming along and then flying up the track at a super steep angle with views all around.",
          "Some say it is quite expensive but all those concerns suddenly disappear when you reach the top. Don't be cheap. It is absolutely worth the trip! High seasons may and will be crowded. Expect long lines and check if some kind of \"fast track pass\" is available. Otherwise, enjoy!",
          "I reviewed the cable car and this was actually part of the ride we took. If you see my review for the ride up take this in consideration as well. All good! You cannot get to the top by one ride only. The Innsbrook card works for this also.",
          "The Hungerburg Funicular is a modern hybrid Cable Car in Innsbruck, opened on 1 December 2007 connected the city old town area \"Congress Station\" take you up to the mountain Hungerburg district, then you get fantastic views, high recommend when visit Innsbruck City.",
          "The funicular runs from the Congress Station at the edge of the old town up to the village of Hungerburg in the mountains. An architectural feat and sight in itself (especially the stations at either end), it takes you in minutes to a point when you can mountain bike or hike;",
          "If you do not have time, or the weather is windy, you will not be disappointed if you do not go all the way to the top of the mountain.The view from the top of the funicular is spectacular. Sunny, bright with a few clouds for contrast is nicest. mid-week is quieter. The front on",
          "We took a trip to Innsbruck on the last day of our holidays and as the sun was shining decided to head up the mountain. We made the mistake back in the summer of buying tickets for the individual stages, which turned out to be so expensive we only went as far as the Seegrube, so",
          "Simply brilliant. We just went for the views and still managed to get good photos through gaps in the snow. I would suggest a vlear day would have made it even better.",
          "The stations on the funicular route are notable for their modern, design led aesthetic. Start your journey at the Congress Station; wait for the funicular to arrive and the metal barriers to drop. The journey is quick and quiet, stopping off at the Alpen Zoo en route. The",
          "Most amazingly beautiful architecture at each station. Quick and easy system to get up to the cable car system and the zoo.",
          "I had read some reviews here about the Humgerburg Funicular that weren't very complimentary. Some people felt let down that it wasn't a real cable car, others that it didn't go very far. Both points underline the need for proper research, which I have done for you, dear reader.",
          "You will certainly regret not going up the cable car, and not just to Hungerburg, but the ENTIRE way up. The views are absolutely incredible. The peak at the very top is worth walking up to as well. I hiked from the Hungerburg down to Innsbruck for an easy ~1 hr hike. DONT MISS",
          "This is a funicular train ride to the top,hold onto something as the train climbs as it gets quite steep,once on top there are spectacular views of innsbruk,a must visit",
          "My daughter and I rode to top. It rained when we left but this snow at the top! Cloud 9 (the bar) wasn't open, but took some pics in the igloo! Very cool!",
          "You can visit the castle and do a guided tour inside it, included in your ticket price (there are tickets for 12 and 15 euros). Up there you will have a great view from the city and the mountains, especially good for pictures. The funicular is very modern and reaches fast to",
          "What a treat to gain such easy access from the old city to the base of the cable car encased in the talent of Zaha Hadid. Both the design of the funicular stations and the engineering of the track are feats to marvel at.",
          "Great views easy to get to and go up to the highest point for amazing views using Innsbruck card. Loved the igloo bar",
          "Excellent to ride. Superbly maintained but if you have travelled around Europe, this is not exactly novel. So, don't expect to be surprised.",
          "Regular furnicular trains departing from various points up the mountain. Excellent views from the top. You can go further up the Nordkettebahn which we didn't as it was kinda late by the time we went up, but the views were spectacular enough from Hungerberg. At the top theres a",
          "We didn't go in the cable train since we were staying outside of Innsbruck, instead we drove to the base of the cable car, it was a prefect clear day and all the review are right on: on a clear day you can see the Alps and then some!! on the top there was snow and lots of places",
          "You would be silly to miss this. Amazing views...providing you get a clear day which luckily we had a clear week. You can see for miles. Don't be daft and miss this.",
          "As well as visiting Old Town, a visit to one of the the Alp tops is a must. Just getting there is worth it, not to mention the view you will get over Innsbruck!",
          "Even the station is worth seeing, for it's architecture. You don't have to wait long for the funicular , and the carriages are large. Scenery is great. Would definitely visit again. It is easy to get to and within walking distance of the ,many other sights in Innsbruck",
          "This is a must if visiting Innsbruck, a cable train then 2 cable cars to the top. There is an excellent restaurant at Seegrube at the top of the 1st cable lift.",
          "The funicular is a really cool ride up the mountain. It starts the journey up the Nordkettenbahnen. My whole family loved it!",
          "You can walk to the top of the mountain if you are feeling energetic. Lots of trails to follow and a place for kids to play with a picnic bench.",
          "The trip from Hungerburg up to Hafelkar is a must for us on our visits to Innsbruck. As it is included in the Innsbruck Card it is also a reasonable cost.",
          "Fast, clean, efficient. No frills to Hungerburg. Very efficient. The frequency is just about right (winter).",
          "This is well worth your time while in Innsbruck. A very modern funicular that is totally automated and gives a very smoothe ride. The views from Hungerburg are great and you can see the entire valley plus the mountains all around. For additional euros you can ride the cable",
          "Well worth the half day it took us to travel to the top of the mountain and enjoy the views. it was really easy especially with the two day tourist card we bought at the hotel. Gluehwein and Apple Strudel at the top - hard to beat!",
          "This funicular is the easiest way to get to the cable cars that take you up to the mountain top. Good views one the way up and down.",
          "Great ride - and a great view from the top!! Whether you just want to see the view over Innsbruck, or go walking in the mountains, I would definitely recommend this.",
          "Visited Dec 2016 - the Funicular is a piece of kit to behold and the engineering impressive, the mountain and views are spectacular when you get off however, the operators are rude and they cram so many people in the carriages you cannot see a thing - What should be a memorable",
          "Use this stunning feat of architecture to commence your ascent up above the City itself. If you aren't impressed then what are you doing in Innsbruck?",
          "Interesting funicular - I loved the stations - work of world known architect Zaha Hadid. She is the autor of Bergisel ski jump as well. Nice ride, partly underground.",
          "Fantastic to see the train climbing up the side of the mountain. It's very modern and pulled up by cable so very safe - some time is spent in tunnels but great views when you emerge.",
          "The Funicular takes you to the base of the cable car and also gives you a great view along the way. It can get a little crowded so you may have to wait a while for the next one to come along but this just gives you even more time to appreciate the great views. Entry to the",
          "On the top the view to both sides is stunning. Worth to go. You also can climb a bit here easily. We had a good time here.",

          "went on the Hungerburg Funicular,spectacular engineering but the experience wasn't pleasant we were jammed in like sardines and stood up pressed against each other, the operator was rude too when asked which station we were at .Opted to go to Hungerburg by bus the second time a",
          "Fabulous experience, went up to 7500 feet, we stopped at 3000 feet at the village for gluwein and to take photographs.",
          "Amazing bit of engineering, the train is made up of carriages that move independently of each other, so as you go up the hill each carriage gets an outward view without blocking the view of the other carriages.",
          "A brilliant piece of engineering and fabulous architecture, taking you up to a lovely view. MUST DO!",
          "The views and the hiking options are amazing. It is something you absolutely can not miss! Just take your time and enjoy ...no need to be in a hurry.",
          "Things across the world are changing. This funicular is just a mode of transport from a level to another. Nothing exciting about it.",
          "On a good day this is an amazing location to take in the local mountains and even those off in the distance. I love that there isn't an abundance of safety barriers ruining the scenery, parents keep an eye on your kids. We had a little snow (October) but the temperature was",
          "This was a nice small excursion for us, having just a couple of hours before next engagement. We took the funicular up to Hungerburg station and took a short walk into the forest an had a nice moment looking at the magnificent view,",
          "Take the J bus from out in front of the tourist info office. Then get the cable car to the top. Skip the funicular, it is hot, crowded, in a tunnel most of the way and doesn't do anything special.",
          "The funicular offers one a comfortable lift up the mountain which allows one a beautiful view looking down over Innsbruck. I saw mountain goats and tons of hikers and bikers as I was lifted up the mountain. There is a nice restaurant at the top where you can purchase a meal or",
          "This was the best thing by far we did in Innsbruck. Yes it\u2019s expensive, but SO worth every cent for the spectacular views from the top. It was overcast the day we\u2019d chosen to go, but it turned out to be a good thing, as once at the top, we were above the clouds and they made",
          "From Hungerburg you were already able to see some beautiful views across Innsbruck and the surrounding mountains, at 860 metres above sea level.",
          "Buy a ticket all the way to the topmost station,enjoy spectacular scenery . Walk around at the top, watch the locals climb Nearby peaks , learn a little about glacial landforms, contemplate the descent on skis. Stop off at the lower station for a coffee",
          "Just go. Don't think, just go. It's so beautiful, amazing, wonderful, breathtaking and feels free to be up there. Just don't forget your jacket.",
          "It was just stunning to look over the gorgeous view from the moving funicular towards the Hungerberg station. I am a visual person so this type of visual effect gave me fantastic impression of Innsbruck. You might need a good camera (smartphones are only for taking panorama",

          "beautiful place to visit specially when you take the cable car and go to the top you can do some climbing",
          "Modern, fast and easy (even for english speakers). Straight from the town to the mountain tops at a very reasonable price.",
          "This was great, purchased the combined ticket to include the zoo and return ride, but as found out that didnt include the cable car to the top.",
          "Although getting to the top of the peek requires 3 different cable cars, the view from the top is absolutely aesthetic. At an altitude of 7,400 feet, you can activate your photo or video and savor the moment. I highly recommend this activity, while in Innsbruck.",
          "This a real must, pay the extra and go to the very top. Views are fantastic well worth the price. Enjoy a bowl of goulash half way up for a very reasonable price.",
          "Would thoroughly recommend this. City to 2200 metres in 20 mins. Light rail from next to Congress station. Then change to cable car for steep ascent. Don't go too late in the afternoon to allow time to catch the second cable car to the peak.",
          "Took the funicular up to the top for the beautiful views of the mountains and the town below. The cars were all crowded and felt like sardine at times but was quick transportation up. Had many stops to get off and see attractions along the way.",
          "We used our Innsbruck cards and were able to check right in here, avoiding a huge queue. The childrens' faces as we climbed the hillside but stayed flat were just brilliant, they couldn't get their heads around it at all. The view at the top was impressive too, although not as",
          "An absolute must if visiting Innsbruck. Just be aware if taking the trip from the second station along the River Inn. The only access is by purchasing a ticket from one of two extremely temperamental machines which take cards only. Be warned!!!",
          "I really loved this. Although I am not that kean on heights, I found this trip up the mountains fantastic. There are two changes to get to the top, but do it and you won't be disappointed. Even though the day wasn't the best you still got great views. And it is included in",
          "Soon after crossing the Hofburg palace while heading towards the river you come across this very modern looking architecture which actually is a funicular station. The tiny funicular train crosses river Inn and goes through the alpine mountains and takes you up to Hungerburg",
          "Took the funicular and tram to the top of the Alps. Hiking was wonderful. The views were breathtaking. Would highly recommend this adventure.",
          "I think this just gets you from town to the halfway point up the mountains but from the viewing area up there you get a nice panoramic view of the Innsbruck area.",
          "Zagat Hadid's brilliant piece wrapping the funicular into the mountain hills gives Innsbruck an edge. Going to the top provides great views of the city and the surrounding Alps in all their magnificence. You can go on and take the cable car all the way to the top, but that's",
          "This funicular is quite an amazing bit of engineering, but for the most spectacular views, you need to keep going up the mountain. We did lunch and the alpine zoo on the way down from the summit Nordkette. The stations are modern and very cool if you like architecture. The",
          "The funicular takes you part way up the mountain, with a stop at the Alpine Zoo if you want. The carriages remain level even when proceeding up the steep slope, giving views over Innsbruck. At the point where the teain ends, a cable car can then be caught to go higher. Another",
          "A trip on this amazing train and then the gondola up the mountain is a must. Before continuing up the mountain on the gondola walk 5 minutes to the small church. It has wonderful modern paintings inside from Weiler, who is one of Tirol's greatest artists.",
          "Quick access from the city to the mountains. Has a stop at the Alpenzoo. Connects to the Nordkette tram with a short walk.",
          "This is the first part of the trip up the mountain. If you only have a little time and want to see Innsbruck from above, just take the funicular. There is a restaurant and viewing areas.",
          "Nice little journey, funicular crosses the Inn river and rises to a station for the Alpine Zoo and then on to the cablecar station.",
          "The station at the top of the views gives great views across the city. If you go to Innsbruck at Christmas there's a little Christmas market at the top which often gets overlooked.",
          "Second cable car from the Nordkett. It's a nice quick ride up and the view was amazing. Unfortunately the food outlets were not open when we went up so we only went up and then took a few photos and went down again. Worth noting we had a pushchair and it was a bit tricky to get",
          "It was a good experience but nothing great from top you get a good view of the city but its something different from other cable cars which are in large numbers in Europe",
          "Well you have been on Funicular in many cities this is no different. It takes you up the summit from where you have good view of Innsbruck. There is nice restaurant for light snacks.",
          "This is a must visit place. It is the second stop of the Norkedette. Though one can go up to Seegrube (the last stop) but we thought it was too expensive and decided to just go uptill Hungerberg. From Hungerberg stop we hiked around the mountains and the views were simply",
          "We parked at the Congress underground parking garage and got on the funicular at its starting point. It was definitely worth it as you see a bit more of Innsbruck before you reach the cable car station. Our kids loved it!",
          "A great way for people who may not have much energy to get to the top of mountains and share the views the walkers and climbers see. Easy to use and good access from the valley.",
          "Even though the cable cars wern't running it was worth it to take the funicular as far as it would go - the views were amazing even from there. We decided to walk down to the next stop on the way back as it said it was only 20 mins. After 20 mins it still said Alpenzoo was 20",
          "We decided to go up the mountain with the Hungerburgbahn spontaneously and really liked it. The train ride is interesting and fast and the panorama is beautiful. There are also some small restaurants up there where we had a beer while enjoying weather and panorama. Really liked",
          "We made a beautiful walk from Absam (bei Hall) over the Adolf Pirlich path to Innsbr\u00fcck Hungerburg (11 km) and took the funicular back to the city to take the bus 151 from the station back to Absam. The funicular at Hungerburg goes down with a train, but you can also up to the",
          "We are not fans of the cable cars, this is much nicer / seems safer, and the little town on top is quite nice, with a nice cafe right there by the funicular.",
          "You can pick up the Hungerburg lift right next to the Congress Haus, just down from the Hofburg and Altstadt, in central Innsbruck and from there go right to the top of the Nordkette chain which rises above Innsbruck. The views are spectacular and there's a mountain restaurant",
          "The funicular ride was very comfortable and efficient. It is indeed breathe taking. This is a bit remote and you will not have a direct sight of Salzburg old city but it is still worth visiting.",
          "A lovely funicular, a very short journey for the price, but the views are fantastic. I loved the design of the stations themselves.",
          "Our first experience of a mountain funicular and it was fun. Enjoyed the transition from the horizontal to the vertical movement which was quite interesting!",
          "This gave us spectacular views of Innsbruck even when the weather was poor. It is a tad expensive but still worth doing. The service runs efficiently and frequently with restaurants at the stops",
          "Easy to use. A bit expensive. But the easy and enjoyable way to get to the top of the mountain. Fantastic panoramic views at all 3 stations on top of the mountains. Travel early in the morning as it is less crowded. Not to be missed.",
          "Took a day trip to Innsbruck from our hotel in Seefeld...did the city walk and came across this as a surprise. The architecture of the four stations is based on the fluid shapes of local turquoise glaciers and is worth the price of the ticket itself. Modern cableway tram system",
          "Nature at its best A must do in Innsbruck Spectacular views and walks at the top A great outing for all ages and very beautiful at the summit",
          "Didn't plan to go on this but glad we did. Due to cloud we didn't continue up on cable car but had a walk around village instead. Had a pleasant few hours up there.",
          "The station is very close to the heart of the city and it starts off more like an underground train then changes into a cable car as it goes up the hill. The stations are very modern and a nice design. Once at the top the views over the city are very good. As we looked out over",
          "You pretty much have to start here (in Congress) to get to the cable car up the mountain. It was quick and easy and not nearly as scary as the trip we did up the mountain last year in Chamonix, France. I'd say 8 minutes and you are up to the cable car where you get out and",
          "I've already reviewed the entire Nordkettenbahn - to the top of the mountains - but I want to elaborate on the fist segment, The Hungerburg Funicular. On the day I arrived in Innsbruck I searched the area of the Congress for the tracks up the mountain, so I could see where the",
          "We were on the funicular last week when it broke down. After a while (about 15 minutes), with no communication apart from a standard message thanking us for our understanding, a man phoned the police when his pregnant wife passed out. We were rescued after about 45 minutes and",
          "Every now and again I undertake an experience which reminds me I'm alive and how wonderful life can be. This is one of those. We went to the Alpine then all the way up to Hafelekar and then returned to Hungerburg for lunch. The schnitzel was freshly made and topped with a bottle",
          "Every time I would see any literature about the Alps, it would feature a classic pic of a funicular. The only transport to get up the mountains. Imagine my delight to see this new transport all nice and shiny and ready to whisk you up the hill. The whole system is well",
          "A chance to see the beauty of city's view from a distance using the cable car and make sure before you check the beautiful weather to enjoy the breathtaking and amazing view of Innsbruck and its entirety.",
          "I took a ride to the top of the Funicular and the views were breathless. I had a light lunch and beverage while admiring the views of the Austrian Alps and the city of Innsbruck below. Take the time to stop by Innsbruck if you are in Bavaria, Austria or Italy, you won't be",
          "Going up the mountains in a cable car you get a beautiful view of the city down below. However ensure it is a clear day. Otherwise, in summer there is nothing much on top of the Rocks.",
          "If you plan to visit innsbruck and even if you have just few hours to move around, this is one place you should not miss visiting. Amazing beauty. You can check the climate using the live webcams even before you go up.",
          "Went up to have a look around, it was 21 deg at the bottom and 9 deg at the top, we had snow on the ground and the clouds came in after about 15 minutes. It was fabulous, i would do it again. Keep an eye on the weather before you go, once the clouds come in you can't see a",
          "Cable car ride is good.views from the top are very nice. Check the climate before visiting.If its cloudy nothing is visble from top .You need to change 2 cable cars to reach top. Recommend time is 2hrs.",
          "We loved going on the Hungerburg Funicular - the trams are very efficient and they provide a fast efficient way up to the top of the mountain above Munich - we highly recommend doing this!",
          "Hungerburg Funicular is part of Norkette. You can reach Hungerburg from Congress station. We went to Hungerburg on clear and sunny day, enjoy a lot,. It was relaxing.",
          "Modern funicular which runs along the flat, through tunnels, over bridges as well as uphill. We stood with the driver and enjoyed the smooth ascent to Hungerburg via the zoo. Look out the the remains of the old funicular on your righthand side after crossing the River Inn. The",
          "This is an attraction that completely makes the Innsbruck Card a bargain. Funicular takes you partway up the Norkette, where you can switch to cable cars that take you up the mountain. Beautiful views, including gliders up against the mountain. Hikers, bikers, people with their",
          "Brought the city pass at the tourist office and this was included in the deal. What an amazing way to travel across the city and up the mountain.",
          "It was a stunning journey on the cable car up to Hungerburg. At the very top - there is a traditional restaurant cafe. The view is stunning and there is a lot of snow. Great for pictures and selfies!! A must go destination if you are in Innsbruck!",
          "Hubby and I stopped for a day trip to Innsbruck on our way from Munich to Salzburg (yes, quite out of the way, I know). He had been as a young boy visiting his family in Munich, so it was time we both went. We found the funicular quite easily (Innsbruck is a bit of an odd little",
          "Hungerburg is a ropeway gondola for reaching Nordkette which is a ski slope. Its a masterpiece of work and technology. It starts with a small train and after a break at the terrace you have to take the gondola. Nice views from the ropeway.",
          "its a modern technology lift which helps to elevate on slopes. funicular means a liftting car or elevator but in olden days they were known as funiculars and now as elevators.",
          "Excellent views of the mountains and the city. Well worth doing even if like me you are not too keen on heights.",
          "This funicular takes the rider from m the center of Innsbruck directly to the Nordkette cable car, and it does it with such ease and beauty. It's hard to not be impressed with it. Every piece of moving machinery runs precisely and smoothly. And as you rise out of the city the",
          "I used the funicular to get to the ski area. It is really slick. Very popular with walkers, skiers and families.",
          "Nice overview spot of the city. We strolled down the path to the zoo station, very scenic and pleasant",
          "Got on in town from Congress using a 48 hour Innsbruck pass. So easy and clean way to start your journey up the mountains",
          "Excellent design and great service of transport up to the first base on Heflekar Mountain. Quick and smooth ride with great views over the city. Stations are modern and beautifully designed.",
          "Believe it or not, this is part of the Innsbruck metro. You can buy a pass, or a round-trip ticket, and ride this from the city all the way to the top of the mountain. There are multiple stops, each one costing a bit more, but the views are worth it at any price. The second",
          "Its a trip you should not miss if staying in Innsbruck, the Funicular train is a great way to the cable car a unique way on the steep sections the carriages change level so every one has a view. from almost the town centre, stop at the zoo is an option.",
          "We used the Hungerburg Funicular to start our ascent of the Nordkette mountain. The station is very close to the centre of Innsbruck and is a pleasant walk alongside the River Inn. We used the Innsbruck Card which gave us inclusive access to the Hungerburg Funicular and also",
          "Incredible experience. From Innsbruck you take a train to go up the mountain at one certain higher to take after the Funicular in 2 stops. First stop already in mountains with heavy snow, lot of children enjoy the snow, one restaurant and souvenir shop. Second stop was more",
          "The funicular is high-tech and impressive. We rode it up to Hungerburg, an attractive village, from where we continued upwards on the Nordkettenbahnen. The excellent-value Innsbruck Card covers travel on both the funicular and the cable car service. This is a must-do when in",
          "We loved the ride. It was so convenient to go up and down. The funicular takes 2-3 interchanges to get to the top. On the way, it offers magnificent views of the Innsbruck town below. There is a nice zoo in one of the interchange stops. Worth a visit, definitely.",
          "It's a short and convenient ride to the mountain from the city. After which we changed to cable car to ride up the mountain. The view was nice from the funicular.",
          "What a great way to get to the ski fields above Innsbruck. The trip was fast, comfortable and a spectacular view of Innsbruck on the way up and down.",
          "We bought an Innsbruck card that let's you ride the buses , you get a trip on the Funicular and the gondola to the top of the ski area included, a great deal. You need to take this to get to the bottom of the gondola, it also stops at the zoo. If you like railroads this is a",
          "Really cool way to get to the cable car, and included in the Innsbruck Card. The service runs regularly and is quite popular.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful way to Hungerburg. As you ascend you can take breathe fresh cold air and watch this gorgeous town and the Alpes from the top. We stopped at the first stop which was the Alpenzoo and then the proceed to Hungerberg. A must visit when you are in",
          "Accessing the mountain was so easy with this funicular railway. It was wonderful being able to have access to the snow & the wonderful views so easily.",
          "This is definitely worth the money. The stop at Hungerburg offers outstanding views of stunning Innsbruck & the Alps. Consider going there just before sunset and staying for a drink so that you can see day & night",
          "We had a great time riding the funicular up and down from Innsbruck to explore the Hungerburg region. Spent some time meandering and taking in the views of the region and spectacular chalets.",
          "I was in Innsbruck with a coach tour who were going to look around the town centre I asked is there anything else to do instead and was told about the trip to the top of the mountain by train and cable car. I thought that's for me! The station for the train was only about a",
          "If you're in Innsbruck you need to visit the hungerberg funicular to the top to see the city in its full glory. It's inexpensive and the views are worth it. If you're feeling energetic you can trek up but it's not for the casual hiker",
          "A Christkindlemarkt halfway up the the Nordkettenbahn. A delightful experience and breathtaking views of Innsbruck, especially in the evening. The design of the Funicular stations was intended by the architect to imitate the movement of a glacier and to my mind he succeeded in",
          "The funicular takes you from the centre of the city straight up to the mountain. It crosses the Inn river on a bridge then starts its steep climb. It has a stop by the alpine zoo and its highest station offers amazing view of the city. Be carefull though, if you would like to",
          "If your going up the cable way, then you can take the funicular to the first station. Once through the tunnel, the views as you travel up are lovely. It runs regularly every fifteen minutes and had two stops in town. It also includes a stop at the Alpine Zoo.",
          "A great way to reach the zoo, or just for a ride to the Hungerburg for great views, the furnicular train feels almost like a theme-park attraction with it's futuristic stations and glass cars.",
          "The funicular starts more as a regular train in Innsbruck; not far from the entrance to the old town, crosses the Inn river before starting it's mountain climb and each car suddenly appear to detach as they move into a vertical position. At Hungerburg there is a small village",
          "dont miss this in Innsbruck- views and atmosphere were incredible. gluwine, deckchairs and -1 degree. magic",
          "What a beautiful day, wondering around the Christmas market on the mountain! The views are spectacular and the ride up very nice",
          "We went on a sunny day in December and it was really beautiful. The ground was covered with snow and it was chilly but a cup of hot chocolate at the near by coffee shop can fix you with a smile ! You get an amazing view of the entire city of Innsbruck! Totally loved it !",
          "I have not been to Europe before, and after a conference we took a week traveling through Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria and Austria was by far the best part of the trip. And the trip up the mountain in the funicular and then the cable car was the best euros spent.",
          "rode the funicular up the mountain...it didn't take very long...the scenery was beautiful...the day was gorgeous.",
          "This place is so beautiful words cannot describe it. This is definitely a must see!! Amazing views all around.",
          "Perhaps a better and cheaper bet than going all the way to the Nordkettleburg peak. Again weather dependent, but even on a cloudy day up higher, visibility can be clear from here. Also, Innsbruck itself is better in focus while you still get the chance to see the tyrolean snows.",
          "What a view! If you love the mountains, this is a fun trip up a cable tram for amazing views of Innsbruck. You should buy the ticket all the way to the top, where you can walk around and check out the other side of the mountain for more amazing views! We stood for a quick",
          "The Alps experience in such convenient way a pleasant surprise with eth funicular taking us to extreme top from where panoramic innsbruck was an awsome sight. Best part was wifi being available at such heights",
          "the view was great especially if you have lunch at the restaurant . The menu is not that great but you can forget everything with that view . there also a pass which you can walk around for about 30 min.",
          "Funi car takes you up the side of the mountain Stopping at two seperate platform great views from both Got some great pictures",
          "Although too cloudy to see anything at the top of the mountain, the Hungerburg Funicular ride to the almost-top was by far the best view and the most fun. The Hungerburg Funicular is really the \"subway\" car to get to the cable car to go to the Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen. The",
          "We were a bunch of 14 people and trust me it was so easy to get here, Also the view form the top was to die for. My family loved it....",
          "Classic sight to see in Innsbruck, and just a short stroll from the Altstadt. Plan to go up around lunch and enjoy a drink and snack with the fine views.",
          "This is probably my favorite part of Innsbruck. The view is breath-taking. I highly recommend getting the Innsbruck visitor day pass (41 Euro each for 48 hours - 20 for children), which includes all public transportation, the funicular and cable car going up the mountain and",
          "The train is a fun ride to get to the zoo or the gondola ride to the top of the mountain. We enjoyed watching the guardrail so rise and fall at each stop. We thought it looked like something a villain would have used in a Bond movie. The train is interesting because it has a",
          "A unique way to travel in Innsbruck and not very expensive. You can take the funicular right from the city centre up to the Zoo and further to the Nordkette cable car.",
          "We took the funicular only up to the zoo level as the weather was very cloudy. Maybe the next time we visit, the skies will be sunny! It seems that anyone over the age of 53 pays the same amount. The fee depends on how far you are going up the mountain. The Congress Station",
          "I took this ride halfway up the mountain. You need a cable car to go the rest of the way. Payment is easy and with a ticket machine, which also had English language. The view from the the end of the line was excellent. I saw a lot of rainbows from there.",
          "We had a lovely trip to the top on the cable car and gondolas. I would say this is the main highlight of our trip in Innsbrook and a must do! We went to the highest point by gondola (and then a short 10 minute walk at the top to the summit). The view was stunning and we had a",
          "Train and cable car to top of mountain - go on cable car to half way point and then change cars for a higher point. Personally I think the first stop on cable car is the better - you can actually see things better and there is an area to relax, have a drink and take in the view.",
          "Ideal for the outdoor person who enjoys the spectacular scenery, and especially for the hiking enthusiasts, the pleasure of the hiking trails and the mountain rrestruants. Being equipped with waterproofs if required is a must and don't let the rain deter you, you can still enjoy",
          "The only ticket offices are at the Congress and at the top station.To get on the train at Loewenhaus or Alpenzoo, you need to use a ticket machine. Took us half an hour to get a ticket at Loewenhaus, as one machine was broken, leaving one machine only for a Sunday crowd and bus",
          "Was a lot of fun with of course great views. Would have been great to hike from but we did not have enough time.",
          "The funicular was great. it had access for strollers as well which was a positive. the funicular really goes up very steeply. enjoyed the ride and it connects with the cable car to top of the mountain as well.",
          "This was a great fun & a definite must to do. Very clean & efficient & really great scenery. A must do.",
          "An amazing engineering project to bring up from the city center, through the mountain to a spectacular view. Keep going up on the connecting Gondola!",
          "This is a really easy convenient way to the top of the mountain. It connects with the city centre trams and runs frequently. We used an Innsbruck card 33 euros for the day and it covered the funicular. I would highly recommend this card. We got great value from it. A short",
          "If you like nature, this is one thing you must not miss. It's absolutely amazing. If you go to Hafelekar, make sure you wear proper shoes and clothes as the temperatures are close to freezing and the snow is still there in August.",
          "The funicular then tram to the top of the mountain was delightful. Even though it became foggy at the top of the lift we were still able to take a descent hike and saw many sights like a heard of mountain tended goats.",
          "This is a must ride to the top of the mountain and is in 3 stages. The price is quite expensive for a family but a once in a lifetime experience. The first stage takes you across the river to a station where you change to the first cable car. From this car you take a second",
          "Taking the funicular and then the gondolas up to the top was great. The views were spectacular and free to go with the Innsbruck Card. Lots of old people hiking up there- way to go!!",
          "You take the train and get on the funicular. A local riding a bike might separate the two but they are not looking at trip advisor. Both can be done in an hour depending on the crowd and both are included on the Innsbrook card.",
          "It\u2019s a little difficult to separate a review of this from the Nordkettenbahnen since for me, they are both inter-linked. But it\u2019s a beautifully designed funicular and probably a \u2018wow\u2019 factor for kids.",
          "Don't miss doing this, even if the weather isn't great. The views are spectacular and the ride up itself is pretty amazing. Have the hot chocolate at the top. It comes out of a machine, but is yummy!",
          "The view from the top of thenHingerburg is amazing. The restaurant is OK but you're there for the view not the food! If you're lucky, you'll catch a hang glider taking off",
          "It was a thrilling ride on the funicular rising against the mountain at a steep gradient. In my opinion, this was one of the best activities in Innsbruck especially in summer.",
          "If you have kids, definitely start from Congress Centre, even if the next stop might be closer to you. It definitely has a huge fun-factor and children just love riding the cable car. There is also a combi ticket with the Zoo available . Don\u00b4t go if you have claustrophobia",
          "Easy ride up in the summer. Its cooler at the top so bring a sweatshirt. We watched a storm roll in from the valley in it was beautiful. You can do a little hiking once you're up there. Stay for lunch and relax on the patio. Its a lovely spot.",
          "It's definitely worth both the time and the money. Great perspective of the city and the countryside. The cars may be crowded but when you get out it's like being on top of the world. Treat yourself.",
          "this is a great experience on the way up to the ski lifts . very clean and modern and provides a good reliable service",
          "A real attraction. Try to get inside the first vehicle, the view is stunning. It is such a futuristic means of transport, fantastic!",
          "It isn't the train itself that is so quiet, but the world around you when you emerge from the top. Clear air, fresh breeze and virtually no sound but the air itself, the pleasant clicking of cameras and the chirping of cups from the cafe ... and that Mountain Goat we could",
          "The funicular and the cable car were a bit crowded but then it was August. But the view from the top is spectacular",
          "Well worth a visit up here. It seemed busy at times but is only a short ride between stations. Innsbruck card includes free ride all the way up and down but this can be broken up with stops e.g. At the Alpen Zoo. Technology of the funicular us amazing in the way that some",
          "We found this purely by accident during a walk along the river - we could see it snaking up the mountainside opposite and were delighted when we realised it would take us up to the Alpenzoo. The starting point is just a stone's throw from the centre of Innsbruck - you cannot",
          "The architecture of the stations is remarkable, and the speed and efficiency of the funicular is commendable. The view from the top is worth seeing - and is almost as worth seeing as from the much higher Nordketten cable-car station, with which this connects. The astute will",
          "This took us to the Alpen Zoo and also connects with the cable car to go up to the top of the mountain.",
          "An option to pass the time in Innsbruck. The funicular is a very modern affair and is very efficiently run. Good views from Hungerburg of the city.",
          "Take a fun ride on the Hungerburg Funicular while in Innsbruck. Be sure to take a camera. Lots of good opportunities for photos.",
          "We parked in City Garage which was across the street they have the same entrance so choose Congress and you will be closer. Also, to get free parking validate your parking ticket at the funicular ticket office at the congress station from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m The funicular ride is",
          "We used the Hungerburg funicular to get to the Alpenzoo. It was convenient and reasonable and afforded a view of the town and mountains as we travelled.",
          "The tram stations are very uniquely designed. With the fluid like surfaces and lack of hard edges, the stations are definitely an interesting sight. The view from Hungerburg is fantastic, however, i would suggest to have something else planned in addition to simply admiring the",
          "I was walking around the old city and just happened upon the station, and decided to buy a ticket and see where it took me. So glad I did. the ride up the mountain was spectacular and the view at the top was gorgeous. Try to go on a clear day if you can because then you can see",
          "This was an amazing experience and I recommend it to everyone! The views from the very top are absolutely INCREDIBLE! You have to see it to believe it. Simple as that!",
          "Took the cable car to top of Nordketten Bahnen (Hafflekar 7,401ft). It was a beautiful day and a lovely trip to the top. Lots of hikers and bikers braver than my husband and I at those heights with tricky rocky slops but a pleasure to watch! A wonderful way to spend a nice",
          "Wonderful views. Nice seating arrangements on this deck. Also smooth and comfortable funicular ride. This is free with the Innsbruck Card.",
          "Conveniently located by the old city. Offers a nice break from walking. Included in the price of the Innsbruck Card.",
          "I actually visited this in May 2014 - but it wouldn't let me pick that month for some reason! It was a lot of fun and you could see a lot. I definitely recommend it.",
          "The views! The views!! The views!!! We went to the top of the mountains and the views are absolutely amazing! Well worth the price of admission! The tram is very clean and well maintained and operates every 10 or 15 minutes. Really amazing! TIP: Bring a jacket or sweater, as",
          "The Hungerburg Funicular is a really quick and efficient way to get from Innsbruck centre to the bottom station of the Nordkettenbahn. You can also use the bus (line J) from the city centre, but the funicular is a more interesting way to travel. The funicular stops off at",
          "Breathtaking views over the city regardless of the time of year. We went in February/March and enjoyed the snowy peaks.",
          "To reach Seebruge we took the funicular. There was a big group of schoolkids who got in and travelled upto the zoo. They were so lively and sang for most of the way.. The funicular is well maintained and provides fabulous service. The station buildings are beautifully designed .",
          "A nice place to stay. all the places worth visiting can be reached by foot from here . Golden dachal or the river inn.",
          "Fantastic experience not to be misses.worth the price. The ride is fun for itself but the view from each level is spectacular.",
          "We took the Tram up to Hungerburg up to Hafelekar on a crystal clear morning. The Innsbruck pass covers the entire trip up and back down. We chose to go early (first train), to beat the crowds and we were glad we did. We watched a Shepard bringing his sheep down to the grass",
          "This is an integrates system that takes people from the Congress Centre to the top of a mountain via tram and two cable cars in about 20 minutes. The view from the top is magnificent with Innsbruck laid out below and surrounding mountains picked out and named through the free",
          "smooth ride and right into the alps. Beauty and crisp air , wonderful view. The rain was only spoiler, rest is worth every minute of your holiday time.",
          "Great little train going up to the Alpenzoo and onto Hungerburg with panoramic views, cafe, supermarket, historic church with frescoes and the start of the cable car up to Seegube. Worth taking the ride. Get on it by congress under a big futuristic canopy.",
          "Took the funicular rail and the cable cars up to the top. Dining at Seegrub is an experience in itself. The view from the top is just amazing! A must do if you are in town. Most well spend 32 euros!!",
          "We enjoyed this trip to the alpine zoo and then on to the cable car. It is a very clever design, nothing like it in our country.",
          "This is one ride you must take. The views are unbelievable. We were there in winter when I suggest you go but I imagine that it is also fantastic in the summer",
          "Take for convenience or park at the next level. This funicular is in a tunnel and when not there are walls blocking any view so take this part of the wonderful ascent only for transportation. If you found this review helpful, please not so below. I appreciate it when others",
          "The FUnicular is a very convenient way to go up to the Nordkette mountain, and the mountain is a must visit. We did a comfortable lazy trip, stopping by on the way at the Alpen Zoo, then the base camp, before going up to the Top.",
          "After taking the cable from base, we had to transfer in another cable to take us to the top. It was chillingly cold with a spectacular view of the city. Food was so good and there was dancing.",
          "I'd last made this journey over 50 years ago and it didn't disappoint. The funicular takes you over the River Inn to the first stage from which you take a cable car to Hungerburg and, if desired, another to the highest point, Hafelekar. At Hungerburg there are several eateries",
          "The Funicular is well run and is an efficient way of getting up the mountain. It's also lots of fun. It's a bit expensive but the view at the top is exceptional. We were blessed with a stunningly clear day so the views were uninterrupted. Not sure if I would bother using the",
          "Great view of Innsbruck and Alps but ensure you can see the peaks from the city before you go to ensure the view. You can get on the funicular near the centre of town. Pricey on its own (\u20ac29) so buy an Innsbruck card (1 day \u20ac33 as at 2015) and you get entry to all the cities",
          "The stations, the detailing, the design, the breathtaking views and the restaurant at the top...just wow. Kids loved playing in the snow and the whole experience is brilliant.",
          "Starting at Congress the funicular speeds along down and through a tunnel before starting to climb. It is an impressive journey up. But even better is the way back when it really picks up speed. Stand at the front and you'll see the other one come hurtling towards you in the",

          "A must thing to do in Innsbruck! We were lucky to have an amazing clear day to see the views, which are amazing and worth the money to get up the mountain. They did push lots of people into one part but you are so busy looking out at the views it didnt really bother us being a",
          "Recommend getting an Innsbruck card. We didn't . Even though it was cloudy the views were still great of Innsbruck and the valley. It's just that once we went through the clouds we emerged into mostly more clouds. Still we could see some of the peaks around us and because we",

          "Kids loved travelling up to the alpine zoo on this unique mode of travel. It came often and people always squeezed everyone in!",
          "its basically a railway to go up to hungerburg , where you have to change to cable car to reach seegrub and another cable car to go up to the peak",
          "A new funicular from my last visit many years ago, it is more like a train now. Makes another stop alongside the river before going up to the zoo then onto Hungerburg. Very pleasant ride.",
          "Used the Innsbruck card for a free trip up the funicular, to the top. Unfortunately it was a rainy day but it had a certain atmosphere as we shared the lift with a couple of guys, a child, and a big cross! Had a little wander but not too close to the edge. On the plus side there",
          "This was such a brilliant experience for us! The views were incredible over Innsbruck, and you really do go high, especially if you go right to the top! The total cost is 30 euro's, which seems a lot, but I do think it's worth it. We spent all day up there, and had lunch and",
          "It was great, except the day we choose to go was very snowy and the cloud came down...So we only went to second stage.",
          "This train takes to the cable car that takes you up to a restaurant bar near the top of the northern range of the alps and the views are spectacular. If you have a couple of hours you can walk down to the train. Expensive but worth it.",
          "Recommendations: Take climbing poles if you are hiking and wish to walk in the unfenced areas. Give at least an hour to make it up the mountain, it took us an hour and a half up, 50 minutes down.",
          "Apparently this was built by a local business man who was annoyed with the lack of public transport between Hungerburg and central Innsbruck. It's a great little train which takes you up the mountain to a Hungerburg, which is a suburb just on the outskirts of Innsbruck.",
          "Went up the cable car to the snow and made a snowman, it was blizzard like and was the best fun. we had a meal in the restuarant and that was delicious.",

          "We went up the Funicular during our second day skiing and it was nice. The views from the funicular are good if you have no clouds in the bottom part of the mountain otherwise you cannot really see anything. it takes about 7-10 minutes after which you need to get off and",
          "Good way to get up the mountain. It was freezing up the top so wear warm clothes especially thick socks. Using the Innsbruck card entitles a trip all the way to the top. Very good value.",
          "This gave us a full morning out of the City. Located just behind the Golden roof, you take 3 (or 4) lifts right to the top of the mountain. The views there are amazing. We went in December where there was no snow in the city but loads at the top of the mountain. Make sure you go",

          "Used The Innsbruck Card for this trip (I cannot stress enough how good value this card is!). Got funicular upto the village, which is very cute and there was a Christmas market there. Then cable car upto the next plateau, which had restaurant (good value), deck chairs, Xmas",

          "My partner and I took the Funicular and cable cars to the very top, Hafelekar. We took the trip on a fairly cloudy day but this added to the wonder of the trip for me. We progressed up the mountain, in three stages. First on the Funicular, which is a technical work of art. We",

          "A brilliant trip. Worth it just to see the stunning architecture of each of the stations. We bought an Innsbruck card so entry to this attraction is free. Stop at the first stop for great views and a sun terrace, then at the top stop do the walk up to the Hafelekar peak. Amazing",
          "We hoped to visit the Christmas market at Hungerburg but discovered that it only opened at the weekends. The views however made it worth the visit. We did not take the cable car further up the mountain as it was a bit pricey but I could imagine that the trip would be worth it",
          "We were fortunate to take the funicular to Hungerburg on a clear sunny day. What a treat as the last time we tried to take the funicular the weather did not cooperate. If you are in Innsbruck you really need to experience this view of the city.",
          "Hungerburg is an amazing picturesque village with an amazing scenery and panoramic view to Innsbruck as well as some traditional chalets, hotels and buildings... We were lucky enough to visit it through December when the xmas market were also open... Quite few and small market",
          "Took the funicular up the mountain side for a breathtaking view of the city and a weissbier at the top. Great activity on the cheap in Innsbruck.",
          "If in Innsbruck this is a must do experience ! The views across the City are simply breathtaking and if you go from stage 2 to 3 you will notice the drop in temperature . At the top its something very special and something you will always treasure :-) PS there are toilets and",
          "What a great view. 7 euro to ride. Go later in the day if you don't want the sun in your photos. The tram ride offers great views of Innsbruck and the mountains.",
          "We used this to get up to the Hunderburg market. Tickets weren't cheap - but you go for the experience.... The ticket machines only take credit cards and can't cope with complicated family parties so queues can build up behind quite easily. The stations are superbly",
          "My son & I have been up this many times and in many weathers. The Views on a clear day from the top of the mountain the \"Hafelekar\" across Innsbruck are superb, you can clearly see the sky jumps on the opposite side of the valley and also the route of the Brenner pass leaving",
          "If the day is clear, spend the few hours it takes and reach the top. Worth every penny. We went on 11/23 and did not even need our coats. Have a beer/wine at the first gondola stop and enjoy the view.",
          "My wife and I were incredibly excited to take the Funicular to the mountain top. The hotel helped us find it, but unfortunately it was closed. I cannot stress enough how much research I did to ensure it was open--checking their website, checking the city's notification of closed",
          "I took the furnicular to Hungerberg but sadly didn't haven't had the opportunity to take the cable cars to the top, I suspect it's well worth it. The furnicular itself is not especially comfy or spacious but it is good fun and offer some nice views. The furnicular terminates at",

          "The funicular leads from the heart of the city up into tha mountains and is the first part of the Nordkettebahn. The way leads partly underground, then climbs between the trees, stopping some time before reaching Hungerburg, where you can change to Cable car or go hiking. The",
          "Nice trip up to the top by funicular and cable car. Had great views across the town and mountains. The funicular felt like very retro sci fi and was nice to travel on. Could go on hikes in the surrounding area.",

          "The cable-car-like funicular is a great way to go up to the alpine village of Hungerburg, which would be quite an uphill hike if you chose to walk. It's quick and easy and not expensive. We did the roundtrip and stopped off at the zoo on the way down (it's about half-way),",
          "It takes a few minutes to see the tiny little Innsbruck in all its beauty! In a fair weather you should definitely spare one hour and a half at least to see the view!",
          "We only went as far as the top of the funicular as it was cloudy so didn't seem worth the price to take the cable car to see clouds! We had tried to go the (clear) evening before, but the funicular stops running at 7pm.",
          "It was a very easy and nice trip to the top with a wonderful view of Innsbruck. We really enjoyed the trip.",
          "The most helpful information I can give is... go early... this will help you to avoid the crowd. After that, prepare yourself to be amazed by the stunning views. Don't be shy, spend 30Euros and go to the top and I assure you that the batteries of yours cameras and smartphones",
          "Avoid crowds by being up early. Fantastic light and views!Hiked to very top...short and not too tough from cable car terminus!",
          "we bought a top level ticket which you can take a 2nd cable car to the top of mountain to see a fantastic view which is very impressive even there's no snow yet. From golden roof in old town, turn right and left and walk straight to \"Congress station\" where the funicular start",
          "The views are spectacular at the top. We loved spending time up there in the cold wind. Mountains and cold have always fascinated me, having lived in a tropical country and this place was perfect to spend a few hrs and just gaze into the surroundings, take pictures and drink",
          "We did not have too much time in Innsbruck but we just had to do this. A fun and fast way to see the area around Innsbruck",
          "What everyone else said it true I can only add that we had a large group and all types of physical ability. Everyone enjoyed \"the day a top the mountain\" that's what we called it! Those that were able climbed up further to the tippy top, others took lots of pictures, and still",
          "Worth the visit where half/full day can easily be spent chilling and hanging around. The Alpenlounge restaurant offers enjoyable view and serves affordable food which was much appreciated as the funicular ticket costs about 30\u20ac when not included in the Innsbruck card.",
          "You can take the bikes for free up to Hungerburg station. some hotels are close by the station and you have got a great view from the top to the city.",
          "We took the train, then the gondola which brought us to the top of the mountain. What a view and what a place for pictures. There was snow !!! We spent the morning sitting outside , admiring the landscape. It was quiet, there were few people. A word of advice, check the fog",
          "The cost is pretty high unless you have an Innsbruck card and then it is free. This is a spectacular ride to the lower cable station and should not be missed during your stay in Innsbruck.",
          "Beautiful vistas of Innsbruck await you at the top. We got on at the River Station and took the short ride down to the main station where huge crowds waited in line and crowded in. By doing this we got to stand at the front of the first car and didn't wait in any lines. You can",

          "Several stops as you ascend to mid-mountain. Photo op at the landing ...R/T ticket will save a little but anyone with an Innsbruck Card or bus pass can return easily to Innsbruck center on the J bus. The funcular ends at the start of one of the many hiking trails up this",

          "It is beautiful and you must go but two warnings. One , my wife and I are over sixty and there was no mention of a senior discount. Ok my fault. But there were fifty kids waiting so I had no chance to read the fine print. I signed that I was offered Euros and asked for dollars.",
          "Didn't realise the station was right in town ... It was complete impulse to go up. Fabulous views! Busy so unlikely to get good viewing position in the car up or down.",

          "We were very excited by our planned trip to Innsbruck, in particular to go up to the Hungerburg and walk in the mountains above Innsbruck - a dream of ours for years. Sadly when we got there on Sunday 17 Aug we found that there was nobody to assist with the purchase of tickets.",
          "I love it! It worth every cent spent on it - i used 24h Innsbruck card. It was little bit crowded in Sunday morning :) but who cares",
          "This is a fantastic experience in Innsbruck. In the summer you can travel on the Innsbruck card, which is well worth the money. Beautiful, modern and efficient.",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck, an Austrian city, was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. It was bombed 22 times by the Allies in World War II, suffering heavy damage.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe widespread area bombing of Innsbruck began in December 1943 and went on until April 1945. Innsbruck is a main transport hub where four rail lines (Arlbergbahn from the west, Mittenwaldbahn from the north, Westbahn from the east and Brennerbahn from the south), converge. A key function as a railroad supply center for Italy made Innsbruck an important strategic target for the Allies.\nUntil autumn 1943, Innsbruck was too far away for the Allied air forces. With the establishment of the Fifteenth Air Force (15th AF) in November 1943, the success of \"Operation Husky\", (the name for the Allied invasion of Sicily) and the subsequent construction of several bases near Foggia in Italy, the city was then in range.\n\n\n=== Table \u2013 the 22 attacks ===\nThe first two raids, on December 15 and 19, 1943, happened unexpectedly: the residents of Innsbruck did not use the air-raid shelters therefore there was a high death toll (259 + 65 people killed).  During the next six months attacks were suspended by the Allies because of preparations for Operation Overlord in Normandy, in France. In this break the military and urban administration of Innsbruck rearranged the anti-aircraft defenses and expanded the air raid shelters. These shelters were mainly constructed by forced labor from the Arbeitslager Reichenau in Innsbruck. 25 underground shelters with a total length of 11,2 km and space for 28,755 civilians were built in 1944.The third attack on June 13, 1944, concentrated on the marshalling yards in Innsbruck. 37 aircraft of the 484th Bomber Group/5th Wing of the 15th Air Force were originally destined for targets in Bavaria, (Oberpfaffenhofen near Starnberg, Allach near Munich, Milbershofen near Dachau and Neuaubing near Munich). Due to bad weather conditions and strong air defenses over Munich, Innsbruck was the alternate target. The narrative report of Mission 31 states:\n\nMaybe men had been wounded, but remained heroically at the assigned posts. Approaching the target, for the second time on this mission the formation encountered heavy, intense and accurate anti-aircraft fire. In the face [of] repeated bursts of murderous enemy gun-fire, the group leader kept his remaining force intact and led the formation on a perfect bombing run for a brilliant piece of precision bombing.\nThe bomber group, with about 350 crew members, suffered heavy losses: four killed, four wounded and 54 missing. 56 tons of bombs killed two civilians, and destroyed the marshalling yards and the Wilten monastery. The bomber crews received a \"Presidential Unit Citation\".The 13th attack on Innsbruck on December 16, 1944, indicated a change in the strategic approach: a higher percentage of delayed-action and incendiary bombs (600 high explosive and 45 delayed-action bombs and 12,000 incendiaries). Innsbruck was no longer treated as a strategic target. The high number of civil buildings destroyed and the high death toll (40 persons killed) indicates \"morale bombing\".The 21st attack on April 10, 1945, was the only night operation. This raid was carried out not by the USAAF but by No. 205 Group RAF. 31 people were killed.The war ended in Innsbruck on May 3, 1945, when units of the US 103rd Infantry Division entered the city. Before, Gauleiter Franz Hofer had delivered a radio speech and forbidden any resistance. \nFrom December 1943 to April 1945, 60 percent of the buildings in Innsbruck were damaged and 461 people were killed.\nBesides the marshalling yards, many historic monuments were destroyed, including: the Servitenkloster monastery (1614\u20131616) and the Bartholom\u00e4uskapelle, one of the oldest buildings in Innsbruck (13th century). The Landhaus or old federal state parliament of 1724, city hall, St. James's Cathedral (1717\u20131724), Stift Wilten monastery (1651\u20131667), the Jesuit Church (1627\u20131637) and several buildings in the historic center were badly damaged.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAlbrich Thomas; Gisinger Arno: Im Bombenkrieg \u2013 Tirol und Vorarlberg 1943\u20131945.

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970. The 1976 Winter Olympics were the last games held in the German-speaking Alps (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland).\nAlong with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Lake Placid, New York in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games.

Nearly 35,000 people commute every day into Innsbruck from the surrounding communities in the area. The unemployment rate for the year 2012 was 4.2%.The national statistics office, Statistik Austria, does not produce economic data for the City of Innsbruck alone, but on aggregate level with the Innsbruck-Land District summarized as NUTS 3-region Innsbruck. In 2013, GDP per capita in the NUTS 3-region Innsbruck was \u20ac41,400 which is around 60% above the EU average.The headquarters of Tiroler Wasserkraft (Tiwag, energy production), Bank f\u00fcr Tirol und Vorarlberg (financial services), Tiroler Versicherung (insurance) and MED-EL (medical devices) are located in Innsbruck.

The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates.\nInnsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations. During the winter, activity increases significantly, due to the high number of skiers travelling to the region. The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck.\n\nLocal public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes.  The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and V\u00f6ls in the west . Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.\nIn December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension across the Inn River and into central Innsbruck.  The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.  The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour. It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.\n\n\n== Education ==\nInnsbruck is a university city, with several locally based colleges and universities.\nInnsbruck is home to the oldest grammar school (Gymnasium) of Western Austria, the \"Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck\".

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

          "The original plan was to go snowboarding over Christmas but the lack of snow made that not feasible. We caught a bus from the Markthalle area which went directly to the resort. We had the Innsbruck pass so the bus and the single ride up came with it. The views off the bus were",
          "Personally I don\u2019t ski, but hubby does, so I spend my time in the restaurant/cafe bar where the food is good and people friendly. Lovely place just to look at the beautiful scenery.",
          "Perfect views. Perfect baileys & gin and tonic. Perfect service. Perfect atmosphere. Perfect day in Austria. Thank you all.",
          "We ventured up the Cable cars to the ski centre at the top with its 2 restaurants. Incredible views from the South and a nice warm Latte in the old restaurant to the left.",
          "Well worth a trip for the walk along to the other station - a couple of hours or more. There are restaurants along the way and you can walk to the summit of the Patscherkofel. If you rely on the bus to bring you back, allow time for the chair lift at the end of the walk. The",
          "This scenic hike can be completed by taking a bus to one end where there is a chair lift, and taking another chair lift down at the other end.",
          "Simply unbelievable, what an amazing attraction within 1/2 bus ride from Innsbruck. Bus J run frequent and drops you at the cable car. One on top the views were outstanding. Walking tracks surround the mountain. It was an amazing experience.",
          "The new cable car is very well designed. The panorama of the Patscherkofel is awesome. However, the opening hours are to narrow. In summer they should have the latest cable car not after 5 p.m.! So all the restaurants close at about 4:30 p.m. already. Schutzhaus was good to eat!",
          "Very easy access and smooth climb of a thousand metres to within 300 metres gentle climb of Innsbruck's local mountain. Very reasonable priced with minimal fuss and waiting (we were here at 10.30 am on a summer Monday). Plenty of good walking around the top of the mountain",
          "This is one of the best experience as tourist in Austria. Facilities are excellent. One can watch breathtaking scenic beauty with ease. It can be enjoyed with friends and family",
          "We went there on 13rd June, following the recommendation of Innsbruck tourist office (going uphill on Thursday evening for enjoying the sunset and the awesome views at early night). However, once there -with our Inssbruck card already purchased and the ticket for parking our",
          "We had the Innsbruck Card, which makes that we could make the ride for free. We only decided at 15H30 to do it, arrived at ground station at 16H00 and arrived at the top around 16H15. We wanted to drink a coffee with a piece of cake on the top, but that was a wrong assumption :",

          "Spacious cable car with clear windows. It went up to a middle station where you can decide to get off or to continue going up to the top. The cable car station was very well maintained and everything looked new. At the top, we could not do the Zirbenweg trail due to snow so we",
          "Very convenient - only 20 minutes scenic drive from Central Train station with bus line J. The view up there was fantastic, with the surrounding Alps and the city below. The surrounding area was filled with ice but some people were hiking around.",
          "Patscherkofel chairlift is fantastic. We had no waiting time to board and the views the way up ( on a clear day), are nothing short of spectacular. If the walking tracks at the summit are open, take a wander. If it's jaw dropping mountain views you want, this area won't",
          "I took the cable car to the top of the Patscherkofel mountain and even though I am not a skier I went there to enjoy the view! Lastly, I visited the place on a sunny snow day which made the views even more beautiful",

The restaurants at the bottom and at the top were great for lunch breaks. Great facilities with ski school and ski rentals",

          "Its a new installation with restaurants and playing areas for the children. The hiking options are good, especially the views of the valley and mountains across. Parking was paid. You can also park at the older installation at Heiligwasserweg 5 for free that is about 1km from",
          "Enjoy great views from this smooth, fast and new cable car. You can get off halfway up the mountain where you change cars, or else just change cars - which takes 20 seconds - and keep going up to the top where you will find the Alpine Garden and a number of restaurants. The cars",
          "It\u2019s nice that you can take the \u201cJ\u201d line bus from downtown Innsbruck right to the cable car station. It meanders thru a couple cute little towns (Vill and Igls) in the way up. Then you need to take a cable car up two levels to get to the top. I like that the cable cars run",
          "You can reach this by car or by the very frequent bus service. A fair bit of investment has gone into this area and is obviously the place to go for winter sports",

          "We went on the chair lift on two occasions during our visit. The J bus took us out on both occasions and a ride on this bus along is a treat. The bus passes through some lovely countryside and some little towns, including the small town of Ingls which is close to a lovely lake",
          "The cable car is new and there is a lot of constructing going on. It was a very quiet day. It all felt a bit \"unwelcome\". Tickets are quite expensive (21 euros per person). The trip to the top was beautiful. We started with a meal at Stutzhaus Patscherkofel and walked part of",

          "Easy access from Innsbruck so busy at weekends. Much quieter on weekdays. This is not a ski in/ski out resort. I visited for a couple of days last year. As an experienced skier I liked the top to bottom blue/red which is great for a couple of days of skiing. It is challenging",
          "The new Ski lift makes this Ski Centre excellent for a days skiing and the lift is fast and efficient and gains over 900m in altitude. The number of slopes are limited but include the 1976 mens olympic downhill piste, a piste thats used for the world cup and a number of blue",
          "a renovated bergbahn with new cabins . Very nice located and at the topstation at 1915 meter you can walk to the top of 2210 meter where there is a small cafe . The restaurant at the topstation was better equipped and better quality .",

          "First of all, the owner of the cable car just built a new one, so the stop down the mountain was also moved. The new one is not that far from the old one, but people visiting there for the first time may need to ensure the plan of public transport or driving. I went there to",
          "Great slopes and found it really good for beginners. Plenty of space for children to bobsled and a bar/restaurant that serves good food at reasonable prices. Food is tasty and portions are big. Easy to access via buses, which are free with a Welcome Card. Stayed here for lessons",
          "We were slightly confused with where patscherkofel was as the old slope has just closed (although google maps for example still shows the old ski lift (as at 8/1/17)) there is now a newer one further up the mountain (I think it opened around the 22/12/17) some of the taxi",
          "So we arrived by train at Innsbruk and we read there that was a tram to the resort but the info people in the train station told us to get the J bus...which we did...leaving the train station, you turn right and keep going until you round a bend and come to a big intersection.",
          "Natural beauty displayed in all its glory ... this area could (should?) feature in Austria's publicity. A wonderful place to relax and explore.",
          "The view of the mountains surrounding the city is incredible , we took the train and 2 cable car to the top , the ride itself is a good experience .",
          "A trip up to the top on a clear day is a must. A chance to see the bobsleigh run from the Olympics and an immaculate, if pricey golf course. If you don't fancy the 2.5km walk each way to the top from the cable car you will still get amazing views from here",
          "it was a treat to take one of the last trips up the mountain on the original tram. we were told by a local that it will cease rides in a month and a new modern tram will open later. we went up in the morning for a hike and as we ascended into the clouds the views were amazing.",
          "Gosh what a view. Went up in the cable car and spent a thoroughly enjoyable day. Hiked various routes and up to the summit. The cost for return on cable car was 43 euros for the two of us, which was excellent value.",
          "As we were staying in Igls this was our local mountain. We got the cable car up (you have to change cable cars at the mid station) we then walked the Zirbenweg path(a very scenic walk which was well signposted and pretty easy and yet gave us stunning views for all 7kms!) We",
          "very nice ride up to the mountain , close to the last bus stop J line, and a bit steep in price but the views are worth every penny.",
          "Me and my girlfriend walked this last week and fully recommend the 7k hike to this peak. Halfway up we took the wrong route and ended up at a bar at the top... Cute bar with 2 lovely local.dogs to greet you. Not much English though. The walk itself was brilliant and had great",
          "Because of high temperature the snow was good till 2pm. The restaurant from up there was pretty cozy with good food and hot chocolate.",
          "It was pretty decent but not at all challenging if you can ski. No one queues so a bit irritating. The bus driver told us to get on when we asked about going back to Innsbruck but then proceeded to drive to every nook and cranny then delivered us back to where we started, after",
          "We got one free access to all mountain lifts on the Innsbruck card and after going up the Nordkettenbahen and having an amazing time decided that we would go up to do some walking and take some photos. We were quite disappointed as if you are not a skier there is not too much to",
          "After not having skied for 20 years, the opportunity to ski the Alps was too good to pass up. We took advantage of the Ski Skule and the Intersport ski rental shop at the mountain. We enjoyed a wonderful day of skiing even with no recent snow, as well as enjoying the gluhwein",
          "We travelled to the top on our first day in Innsbruck and loved it. Had a beer at the restaurant/cafe there while enjoying the views and the sun. Worth a trip even if not skiing as you can go back down in the cable car.",
          "Great day skiing on what is a relatively small ski field. The views are absolutely amazing and the slopes are near empty which makes for an amazing experience topped off by getting to complete the olympic track Be sure to do the bobsled track that is located next door!",
          "We went to ski to Patscherkogel during our stay in Igls. Even though all slopes were not open, the ski day was memorable due to: 1. Empty, well prepared and long slopes, 2. Excellent view of Innsbruck and surrounding area, 3. The feeling of history (past Olympic games).",
          "The view from above is breathtaking! The hike up the hill is worth it and is beautiful too. I would not recommend this hike with small children, but I would for a good walk with dogs.",
          "Went here for the first time this year, the ski bus took a while but it was definitely worth the trip from Innsbruck.",
          "A great alpine world experience and excursion. Don't miss - this is a Must when in Innsbruck. Wonderful all round mountain view from the top. great Alpine Flora and Fauna ... Don't forget ... and don't miss also a visit the Swarowsky museum / factory when in Innsbruck.",
          "We came without any expectations... day before it we visited a Innsbruck's bang and enjoyed very much... we came early (must come early) to be able to see the valley view due to sun's direction... up there was pretty cold but the view we got was amazing... there is also",
          "We took the J bus to Patscherkofelbahnen, as we read it was better than Nordkette. It did have it's benefits, but I'd say do both. We got a 2.5 km hike in to the top, where it was snowing however we warmed up at the rifugio there - best goulaschsuppe I've ever had! We then",
          "Take a Bus J and ride up the meandering route to Patscherkofelbahn, get down the bus, take a walk around Igls and Vill. You shall be promised a great view of life time, better than the Nordkettbahn ( though I would view Nordkettebahn as not to miss, I would say the",
          "There are two easily accessible cable cars in Innsbruck. The Patscherkofel is a bit lesser known one, but offering better views over the city. Logistics: with the car (over Igler strasse) or with the bus J. From the mountain station you can really do two things in summer. Hike",
          "The Patscherkofel is a fantastic area on the south Alps but easily accessed from Innsbruck CBD. We stayed at h Hotel Innsbruck (fantastic) and caught the No 1 tram (fare included in Innsbruck card) to Bergisel. ( 10 min) If you have time go up to the Olympic ski jump, you won't",
          "We were excited to have a hotel next to the Patscherkofelbahnen, and were keen to check it out. But keep in mind that the lift only works when there is enough snow, and our arrival in Innsbruck mid-December meant we missed out.",
          "I was there just yesterday and it was really amazing. You will definitely have a panoramic view of Innsbruck, the beautiful alps and probably the whole of Tirol. I bought the \u20ac25 combo ticket, for both the Bergisel and the Patscherkofelbahnen. You can choose whether you want to",
          "We walked the Zirbenweg from Tulfes (Glungezer mountain) to Igls (Patscherkofel), you can also walk the other way. The route is 7km but seems longer. Be sure to pack enough water and some snacks if you walk from Tulfes because the only cabin you'll find if the Boscheben H\u00fctte",
          "Fabulous views over Innsbruck and down the valley from the Patscherkofel summit. If you get off at the last but one station you can take the Zirbenweg - a nature walk with interpretation panels and learn more about the flora and fauna of the Alps around Innsbruck.",
          "The Olympic Mountain is beautiful. We reached in the morning around 10 and there wasnt much queue for the cable car.A bit cloudy itself made it more splendid with cows grazing and scenic hiking routes. Worth visiting for the views from the top and the trekking route.Cable car",
          "To experience the majestic beauty of Tyrol, this the place to be. The Patscherkofelbahnen is what we commonly call rope-wayin India.",
          "My Austrian friend took us all up here, all i can say is wow.Once out of the car there were cow on the mountainside and we walked to a little cafe for lunch.The walks are fairly easy but you have to be careful in places. FANTASTIC is all I can say.",
          "I must admit being a beginner in skiing is all hard work but seeing its nice view and a few slopes made for novice skiers are alright but if you already can ski this area is such fun to ski with.. I may be a novice but i was able to ski at their blue area( beginners slope)..",
          "A regular service taking you to a wonderful viewpoint where there is also a very good restaurant. A little pricey.",
          "We paid 13.50 euros each to go to the summit. It takes around 15 minutes and the view from the top is amazing. Thick snow loads of skiers a restaurant and absolutely freezing. Make sure you are well wrapped up and well equipped",
          "My wife, daugther (7) and I were there with an instructor. The beginner lift are perfect, they also have a magic carpet. They have put up a slalom course. Which is very good for training.",
          "On our first time at Patscherkofel we were positively surprised about this nice ski area. The area is famous because of the two Olympic winter games in Innsbruck and is located close to Igls. There are two valley stations: Patscherkofelbahn (big gondola) and Olympiaexpress. The",

          "Cant say it is a major tourist attraction. It is an average place, but it was fine to see when I had to stroll from the train station to sight see the city. This is the nice thing about Innsbruck. If you have time between connecting trains you can use it in some strolling.",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F).

There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck.\n\nLocal public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes.  The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and V\u00f6ls in the west . Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.\nIn December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension across the Inn River and into central Innsbruck.  The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.  The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour. It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.\n\n\n== Education ==\nInnsbruck is a university city, with several locally based colleges and universities.\nInnsbruck is home to the oldest grammar school (Gymnasium) of Western Austria, the \"Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck\".

        "brit": "Innsbruck,  city, capital of Bundesland (federal state) Tirol, western Austria, on the Inn at the mouth of the Sill River in the Eastern Alps. First mentioned in 1180 as a small market town belonging to the Bavarian counts of Andech, it developed rapidly because of its strategic position at the junction of the great trade routes from Italy to Germany via the Brenner Pass and from Switzerland and western Europe. The bridge (Br\u00fccke) over the Inn originally carried this traffic and gave the city its name and its insignia. Innsbruck was chartered in 1239, passed to the Habsburgs in 1363, and in 1420 became the capital of Tirol and the ducal residence under Frederick, the duke \u201cof the empty pockets.\u201d Napoleon gave the city to the kingdom of Bavaria in 1806, and during the War of Liberation (1809) four battles were fought around Berg Isel, a hill (2,461 feet [750 metres]) immediately to the south, by Tirolian patriots led by Andreas Hofer against the Bavarians and the French.Innsbruck, Austria.\u00a9 Digital Vision/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nWorld Cities\nWhat is the citadel of Moscow called?\n\n\n\nThe old town has narrow streets lined with medieval houses and arcades. One of the most famous buildings is the F\u00fcrstenburg, with a balcony with a gilded copper roof, supposedly built by Duke Frederick and refashioned by the emperor Maximilian in about 1500. Other notable landmarks include the Hofburg (1754\u201370, on the site of a 15th-century ducal residence) and the Franciscan, or Court, church (1553\u201363), containing the mausoleum dedicated to Maximilian I and the tombs of Hofer and other Tirolian heroes. The university was founded by Emperor Leopold I in 1677, and its great library was a gift of the empress Maria Theresa in 1745. There are four major museums: the Ferdinandeum, with prehistoric, industrial-art, and natural-history collections and a picture gallery; the Tirolean Folk Art Museum; the Museum of the Imperial Rifles; and parts of the collections of the archduke Ferdinand II, in the Castle Ambras.F\u00fcrstenburg building with gilded copper roof (left background), Innsbruck, Austria.Louis Goldman\u2014Rapho/Photo ResearchersInnsbruck is one of the most popular tourist and health resorts and winter-sports centres in central Europe.

          "We were on our way from Oberammergau (Germany) to Bolzano (Italy). The drive was short, about 2-3 hours. Innsbruck was never on our radar because of the location. You can pair Prague and Salzburg, but Innsbruck is always left outside. So this time we decided to stop there for",

He was born in the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso in Segovia Province, and was consequently granted the non-substantive title of \"Duke of Segovia\", courtesy he held along with \"Duke of Anjou\" as the Legitimist pretender to the French throne. Jaime was a great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Succession ==\nBecause he was deaf, as the result of a childhood operation, he renounced his rights to the Spanish throne for himself and his descendants on 21 June/23 June 1933. He was then granted the title \"Duke of Segovia\" by King Alfonso XIII. After his father's death in 1941, he proclaimed himself the senior legitimate male heir of the House of Capet, heir to the French throne, and head of the House of Bourbon. He then took the title of \"Duke of Anjou\" and became, in the opinion of French legitimists, the de jure king of France as \"Henri VI\", though to a minority as \"Jacques II\" (after 1957, he signed all documents as Jacques Henri).In 1921, he became the 1,153rd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and Knight with Collar of the Order of Charles III and Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic both in 1925 (Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1931). Later in 1941, following the death of his father and his ascendance to the title of King of France, Jaime adopted the Order of the Holy Spirit as his own by his right to the French Throne. \n\n\n== Marriage and issue ==\nOn 4 March 1935, in Rome, Jaime married Victoire Jeanne Emmanuelle (Emanuela) Jos\u00e9phine Pierre Marie de Dampierre (8 November 1913 in Rome \u2013 3 May 2012 in Rome), daughter of Roger de Dampierre, 2nd Duque de San Lorenzo Nuovo, Vicomte de Dampierre (1892\u20131975) and of Donna Vittoria Ruspoli (1892\u20131982), daughter of Emanuele Ruspoli, 1st Principe di Poggio Suasa, and his third wife, English American Josephine Mary Curtis. Don Jaime and Donna Emanuela had two sons, named after Jaime's hemophiliac brothers, Alfonso and Gonzalo:\n\nAlfonso, Duke of Anjou and C\u00e1diz (20 April 1936 \u2013 20 January 1989); he married Mar\u00eda del Carmen Mart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa y Franco on 8 March 1972 and they were divorced in 1986. They had two sons and four grandchildren.\nGonzalo, Duke of Aquitaine (5 June 1937 \u2013 5 March 2000); he married, Mar\u00eda Carmen Harto Montealegre on 18 April 1983. He remarried Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes Licer Garc\u00eda on 25 June 1984 and they were divorced on 31 January 1989. He remarried again Emanuela Maria Pratolongo on 30 June 1984 and they were separated on 7 March 1986. Gonzalo and Emanuela were also married in a religious ceremony on 17 September 1992. He has an illegitimate daughter and five grandsons.Don Jaime and Emmanuelle de Dampierre divorced on 6 May 1947 in Bucharest (recognized by the Italian courts on 3 June 1949 in Turin but never recognized in Spain) and, on 3 August 1949 in Innsbruck, Don Jaime remarried civilly to divorced singer Charlotte Luise Auguste Tiedemann (2 January 1919 in K\u00f6nigsberg \u2013 3 July 1979 in Berlin), daughter of Otto Eugen Tiedemann and wife Luise Amalia Klein. In the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church and of the French legitimists, Emmanuelle de Dampierre remained always his wife. The second marriage produced no children. His first wife remarried in Vienna, on 21 November 1949, to Antonio Sozzani (12 July 1918 in Milan \u2013 6 January 2007 in Milan), son of Cesare Sozzani and wife Cristina Alemani, without issue.\n\n\n== Renunciation ==\n\nOn 6 December 1949, Don Jaime retracted his renunciation of the throne of Spain. On 3 May 1964, he took the title \"Duke of Madrid\" as head of a Carlist branch of the Spanish succession (recognized as King Jaime IV of Spain by the legitimist group of Carlists who did not support the Bourbon-Parma claim after Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime died in 1936). On 19 July 1969, Don Jaime definitively renounced the Spanish succession in favour of his nephew, the future King Juan Carlos I of Spain, at the request of his elder son, Alfonso de Borb\u00f3n.\nDon Jaime died in St. Gall Cantonal Hospital in Switzerland on 20 March 1975. He is buried at the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nHeraldry of Infante Jaime of Spain, Duke of Segovia\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nZavala, Jos\u00e9 M.

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war.

          "Everything about visiting here was wonderful! The museums are interesting ( you can spend as much or as little time as you like). The castle was really beautiful and interesting - lovely views. By the 3rd floor, we had gotten tired but there is a lot to see here. The grounds",
          "The castle is situated on a rock above the valley of river Inn and this itself is a great attraction for the exterior and has a great big garden while the amazing paints decorated the interior",
          "This is a picture perfect renaissance castle and palace built in a hill above the valley. The place has a well manicured picturesque vast garden with flowering plants even.",
          "Since we forgot to press the stop bus (take bus 4134) we saw a bit more of the area than intended haha but it was worth it. The castle has a real nice park to walk around in with a pond, small bridges, Black swan, peacocks and so The castle it self was nice as well, it's an",
          "This is a location that is well worth a visit. Easily reached by bus from Innsbruck town - a 10 - 15 minute journey. Buses run every 30 minutes. The castle itself is an imposing builkding sat upon a hill, with stunning aprklands and woodlans to walk in. The viewsof Innsbruck",
          "Reachable via the hop on hop off tourist bus. We spent a couple of hours here in total, including a coffee stop. Is worth a visit.",
          "It looks picture perfact - and it actually is! It looks really well maintained from the outside and so pretty. As you walk through the nicely laid out garden you may spot both and ordinary peacock and an albino peacock - they certainly made enough noise! Inside the castle, which",
          "We visited because the weather was bad and it was raining so we needed an indoor activity. This would also be good to do when the weather is nice as there is good views over Innsbruck from the garden. We used the sight seer bus which is good because it\u2019s free with the Innsbruck",
          "We had the Innsbruck Card, so we could go to Ambras castle for free using also the Sightseer bus in both directions. The castle has some very interesting parts to see, first of all the Armoury and the Chamber of Wonders. Also the Spanish Hall is very impressive. Unfortunately,",
          "Yes, there is no shortage of Castles and Museums to see, owing to the long monarchy system that prevailed Austrian-Hungarian empire. Its open from 10 am \u2013 5 pm & the ticket prices change from \u20ac10 starting Apr and remaining as low as \u20ac7 till Mar end). I liked the Armory",
          "We took the postbus from the train station to the gates of the Schloss. A few minutes walk through lovely grounds led to the castle entrance. First stop the Cabinet Of Curiosities collected by the Arch Duke. Wonderful and strange things in glass cases. Into the castle itself",

          "We were expecting a bit more based on reviews we'd read. They were having a festival when we went, but aside from the opening presentation, it seemed more for kids than adults. We went through the castle/museum and found it somewhat disorganized. The armor collection was",
          "The museum was fascinating but the grounds were a little disappointing. We went there on our Innsbruck Card but wished we had gone to the Imperial Palace instead.",
          "Schloss Ambras is worth the extra effort to get there compared to a number of the attractions that are in the centre of the city. If you have the Innsbruck Card entry to the museum is free and you can use the Sightseer Innsbruck bus to get there. Although it was raining when",
          "Located within 15 minute bus ride is this wonderful castle. Dating back centuries and must have one of the most extensive collection of armour in Europe. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",
          "It seemed a good idea to take advantage of the transport offered by the Innsbruck hop on and off bus, to venture into Schloss Ambras, and we were not disappointed. Down a driveway into a wooded area, we found an impressive Castle where Ferdinand 11 stored a number of of his",
          "This has to be one of the most underrated attraction in Innsbruck. It is claimed to be the oldest museum in the world with the fortress at Ambras was turned into a Renaissance castle by Ferdinand 2, housing his collection. It was a gift to his wife. I absolutely loved this one,",
          "It's not every day you can visit a castle in park just outside a city! This one is complete with a major exhibition of armour and paintings - descriptions all in English. The grounds are impressive - our favourite area had to be the waterfall and forest glades just to the back",
          "I have been there 3 times and I will go again. The castle is simply fantastic, perfectly preserved. Dozens of rooms to visit, all in perfect status The armour room is fantastic (see pictures) Parking available outside",
          "really nice place where you can spend hours in the museum and outside in the beautiful parks. Highly recommending it with kids",
          "Enjoyed strolling in the pretty gardens more than looking at the rather gruesome contents of the interior. Rather abrupt staff checking tickets, despite already having the Innsbruck card, and shouting at me for carrying a rucksack. The food in the cafe is nothing special but",
          "We took the Sightseer bus here, mainly to see the Spanish Hall, but the whole building was interesting and the gardens were very attractive too. It was intriguing to see how the older fortress had been added to and altered over the years to become a luxurious palace. That said,",
          "We hopped off the bus to take a look at the Castle. An absolutely lovely building and grounds to walk round. The main hall is something to behold with all the past emperors and royalty painted on the walls a truly magnificent room. Walking round the castle there were some",

          "Very busy & limited parking on a Sunday afternoon. We were fortunate to get a spot, and delighted that departing driver gave us their parking ticket. Saved the 70 cents per half hour /\u20ac7 per day charge. Once inside, it was worth taking a wander around the gardens. We didn\u2019t go",
          "This is a well maintained palace that is now a museum / gallery. If you are looking for rooms still set up the way they were, then you won\u2019t get that here. Although the displays and art were amazing and relevant to the history of the palace, as you walk from room to room there\u2019s",
          "We were on the Innsbruck Hop-on-hop-off bus tour and we got off at the Schloss to walk through the gardens. They are really lovely. It was a beautiful day so we decided not to go inside (although we did have a lovely coffee in the Ferdinand Cafe/Bistro).",
          "Really nice castle and worth visiting. I have seen 4-5 peacocks just walking next to us in the castle garden. My kids enjoyed a lot.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the castle - it is well laid out, the descriptions are in German and English. Guides are throughout the property and are helpful. We had an Innsbruck Card so entry was included in the card. We had a hard time getting to the Castle on the bus",
          "We took the C3 bus to Luigenstrasse and walked up to the Schloss through the park - very pleasant. The visit to the exhibitions was well worth the effort and we found the Spanish Hall especially impressive. The armouries and the Hapsburg portrait gallery were also worth spending",
          "Really above expectations also for the kids. A guided tour is strongly recommended. Kids liked the nice guide and what he told about the history of the castle through many interesting stories",
          "So lovely to wander the gardens and grounds at your leisure. The Innsbruck card will get you free entry into the Castle and tour the wonderful artefacts and read the history!",
          "The buildings are in great shape, and the armament display was quite impressive. I also liked the area of curiosities. We used the audio guide and it did help considerably in understanding what we were looking at, but I will say that the displays have really good descriptions on",
          "It\u2019s an interesting enough castle in nice grounds. There\u2019s a museum of curious things and lots of armour. The main building has a cafe which was struggling to serve everybody. The art collection here is a homage to the Hapsburg dynasty. There are more Hapsburg portraits here",
          "Long walk through park to Castle, with poor signage - don\"t get lost - just keep walking up!!. Excellent venue. Great museum of armour and artefacts collected by royal family. Superb art gallery in castle. Well worth visiting. Excellent cafe in castle grounds.",
          "Museums are not a favorite in my family, but this display of curious collections made for ver interesting day. The collections showed a lighter, fun atmosphere that the monarchs enjoyed. Beautiful location, audio tours available.",
          "The Ambras Castle was one of the highlights of our trip to Austria and Italy. Interesting, entertaining, colourful and easy to find your way around. We had a nice coffee in the lovely little restaurant and the shop was well stocked. The staff were friendly and helpful and",
          "A must while in Innsbruck. Not overprized and there is plenty to see. And the location is absolutely beautiful and peaceful.",
          "We had the Innsbruck card so we visited Schloss Ambras using the card for entrance and we also used the hop on/hop off bus to get here and back (included in the card) which made it very easy. The castle itself has lots of interesting art and artefacts and it is good to wander",
          "there is limited parking from what I could see and you do need to pay, once inside the gardens and grounds are nice to wander around, the exhibits are in 2 sections, there are toilets and a cafe in the main building.. The exhibits give you a small sense of this castles vast",
          "The website let\u2019s you choose the month of November like if there is availability, but when we got there, the place was closed, there was even a sign that said it\u2019s closed for the month of November, so we could not see the castle inside. Trip Advisor please update. The",
          "The castle grounds offer nice walking paths all year around -- beautiful winter scenery with half-frozen waterfalls",
          "Schloss Ambras is a beautiful castle surrounded by stunning paths through the woods and wonderful gardens.",
          "Very nice displays and stills, but this is not my kind of museum. No lift for elder people (I'm over 60 and have Artritis). Security guard could tell a lot about the museum. For that and their willing to help, they receive an above average.",
          "The Ambras castle is within easy reach from central Innsbruck thanks to the bus and tram stops right next to the castle grounds. As a walk, it is a bit of an uphill experience, so not recommended for everyone. Tram 6 is a good bet, but during the winter it only runs on the",
          "It is nice place to visit to have a glimpse into the regional history. The exhibits are pretty diverse ranging from war related items to beautiful paintings/art work. The garden and architecture style itself are very nice. Most of the items are in a really good condition. The",
          "Great history, artefacts, and terrific collection of art and armour. Close to the city, easy to reach by #6 tram or bus, or even a short walk. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited Schloss Ambras during a short stay in Innsbruck which proved an excellent decision. The castle is on the outskirts of Innsbruck but using the IVB app the journey is fairly easy to negotiate, the bus stopping outside the park entrance. The castle is 7 euro's to enter",
          "We got of the tram 6 and went to see the castle. As we did not want to go inside the castle we walked in the park sorrounding the castle. It was fantastic, the autumn collors, the castle in the background. The pictures were perfect.",
          "The museum is not only place showing the piece of Tyrolean history, or Austrian bur it is imporatnt place of European past times. Great place for relaxing and information.",
          "If you expect the usual ordinary old castle - you will not find it here. It is more of a residence which shows the different dynasties who were owners of it, lots of art in different forms. One of the most impressive things for me was the hall with the glasses - really fine and",
          "Schloss Ambras Innsbruck is a nice clean palace, great place to spend the afternoon. and closes early",
          "The museum features the armouries and art showing collections of Tyrolean history. The most notable architecture is the Spanish hall which contains intricate wood- inlay ceiling with walls which were adorned by portraits of Tyrol rulers. The garden surrounding the castle was",
          "If you are interested in European history, this is s great museum. One half of the museum is centered on the collections of Archduke Ferdinand. The other half shows how the relationships involving members of the Hapsburg dynasty influenced European history for 300 years. The",
          "We used our GPS and made an easy entrance and exit to & from Schloss Ambras off the motorway. What a place filled with fascinating things! The armor collection of Ferdinand II is extraordinary, and there are several floors in the castle filled with interesting furniture,",
          "Beautiful castle on the outskirts of Innsbruck away from the congestion of center Innsbruck. Parking is available right outside the entrance. Allow sufficient time to get an audio set to tour the castle. Beautiful portrait galleries and display of armor.",
          "This castle is one of the most beautiful we have seen on our tour in Austria. From Innsbruck you can get there after about twenty minutes by bus (we took a Hop on / Hop off, very comfortable and included in the Innsbruck Card). The Castle is surrounded by greenery and has a very",
          "Lots to see in this deceptively old castle. Lots of interesting artefacts and great armour from the 1500's. The price was reasonable and the park surrounding the castle is free to enter.",
          "Did it as a part of the HOHO bus tour. After a small walk from the stop, you're greeted with few peacocks, one of them is white in color. I didn't do the inside but from outside and the gardens, it looks beautiful.",
          "It's a short walk from the bus stop. There are lots of rooms and stairs, the armoury exibit is very very good. Pick a lovely sunny day as there is a beautiful garden to walk through.",
          "Superb displays in the Upper and Lower sections. The Spanish room is not to be missed, as is the upper decorated courtyard. Very good, with attractive gardens.",
          "Well worth a visit. Loads of history and an amazing building.Lovely walks in the surrounding woodland.",
          "45 minutes walk from central Innsbruck up on the hillside. I walked through the gardens and visited the museum and palace. Lots of suits of armour and weapons on display, plus portrait paintings and belongings of the Habsburg rulers of the castle. Also some nicely decorated",
          "The Ambras Castle is no longer a castle, its more a museum. Seems a bit hyped. Same stuff like the Imperial Palace. However the gardens and the views from the top are superlative. It is covered with the Innsbruck Card so can be done if you have time.",
          "This castle is a must see if you are in the area. It has a great armory, and also a collection of curiosa. We wonder if Ridley Scot got his idea for his collection at this castle. It has some magnificent rooms and don't forget to take a look at the ceilings. Some are really old",
          "We were very impressed with the collections at Schloss Ambras. The cabinet of curiosities (in fact several rooms of objects) is a treasure trove of the Renaissance. The collection of armour is world class as is the glass collection and the Habsburg portrait gallery has paintings",
          "The Ambras is not huge but very nice indeed, full of curiosity objects and amazing gardens around it. Very close to the center and worth a visit",
          "This castle with its extensive park , is located on the outskirts and is one of Innsbruck attractions . Inside many armours are exposed , made with great skill either for soldiers or for knights. A large gallery , laid out on three floors, with many paintings and potraits",
          "We arrived pretty late and had to go around looking at the paintings and artefacts quite quickly. What we saw was nice but the highlight was the fabulous gardens all around it. It is a lovely place for walks, sitting out and picnicing. We saw lots of families with children",
          "This is a great way to escape a rainy day in Innsbruck, (although I will go back to see the gardens on a sunny day.) There are macabre exhibits.....portraits and strange memorabilia of Vlad the Impaler, stuffed sharks, ancient shoes, armour, an eclectic mix of objects collected",
          "Spectacular castle is a gem in Innsbruck! The Sightseer bus takes you right to the front of the gardens of the castle. Walking through the gardens is a real treat and reminded us of walking through the most grandest of parks in the world coupled with a grand tour of a",
          "Ambras castle is gorgeous and so well-preserved! The collections of armor, glass, portraits, and novelties were very impressive. There were a few modern, confusing exhibits; I agree with other reviews that these could be removed. The grounds are impeccable and there are",
          "Once to go through the museum and a second to spend the afternoon for lunch and soak it all up. Lots of history here! We saw the chapel the armour room and lots of floors to view. It was worth the time. Just the beauty of the building and gardens are enough reason to go there!",
          "Amazing castle, great woodland walks, excellent value for money. The views are incredible , right over Innsbruck. Visited while using the sightseer bus.",
          "The forecast was for rain and thunder, so didn't want to risk a trip up the mountains. Instead, we opted for the indoor environment of this castle. Splendid armour section with many intact suits, including some original gear worn by historical figures. Amazing collection of",
          "We visited here on the hop on hop off bus using the Innsbruck card. It hosts a range of armory, art works and artifacts. The grounds are impressive with views over the town. A great place to spend a few hours.",
          "This schloss or castle is located on top of a hill surrounded by aa beautiful garden where white peacocks were roaming freely. When I went there, very few tourists were around, giving me time to go through the art collections in the castle. I really liked the serene",
          "Fantastic castle, with some amazing art and artifacts - including armour, and the collection of curiosities!",
          "The entry fees are low and allows you to visit two museums and the castle. The museums have interesting armor and artifact displays. The castle is tremendous and allows you to wonder about to view its offerings. There are a few peculiar displays in the castle, but it keeps",
          "It's a nice place to visit on a rainy day. Getting there - by car can be done down the street which is right next to the buss station (left side if you come from Innsbruck and VERY sharp right if you come from Aldrans) and parking is on the side of the road mostly. Service -",
          "Once the symbol of the area's power, later the museum Arch Duke Ferdinand 11. Today enjoy the arsenal,( Rustkammer, the Kunst -und Wunderkammer, the chambers of arts and marvels , and the portrait gallery which features pretreats go the Habsburgs by Ruebens, Cranach, and",

          "We found that many other Innsbruck sights are closed on Tuesday, and this is particularly a shame when low cloud means the great mountain trips aren't worth doing. We resorted to Schloss Ambras, and were impressed. The Spanish Hall is stunning, in its scale and perfect",
          "We drove to this Castle and found a free area to park. It took us one hour to visit. We enjoyed the armors, the peacocks in the park, the collection of skeleton sculpture and other antiques. It was worth the visit and the bookshop was interesting.",

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970. The 1976 Winter Olympics were the last games held in the German-speaking Alps (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland).\nAlong with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Lake Placid, New York in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games. It also hosted the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics.\nInnsbruck hosted the 1st Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012.Innsbruck also hosts one of the 4 ski-jumping competitions of the 4 Hills Tournament every year.\nOther notable events held in Innsbruck include the Air & Style Snowboard Contest from 1994 to 1999 and 2008 and the Ice Hockey World Championship in 2005. Together with the city of Seefeld, Innsbruck organized the Winter Universiade in 2005. Innsbruck's Bergiselschanze is one of the hills of the famous Four Hills Tournament.\nInnsbruck is home to the football club FC Wacker Innsbruck, which plays in the Austrian Football Bundesliga (first tier) as of the 2018\u201319 season. Former teams include the FC Swarovski Tirol and FC Tirol Innsbruck. FC Wacker Innsbruck's stadium, Tivoli Neu, is one of eight stadiums which hosted Euro 2008 which took place in Switzerland and Austria in June 2008.\nThe city also hosted an American Football final, Eurobowl XXII between the Swarco Raiders Tirol and the Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna.\nThe city hosted opening round games in the 2011 IFAF World Championship, the official international American Football championship.\nIn 2018 Innsbruck hosted the IFSC Climbing World Championships 2018 from September 6 to September 16 and the 2018 UCI Road World Championships from September 22 to September 30.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nInnsbruck is a substantial tourist centre, with more than a million overnight stays.\nIn Innsbruck, there are 86,186 employees and about 12,038 employers. 7,598 people are self-employed. Nearly 35,000 people commute every day into Innsbruck from the surrounding communities in the area. The unemployment rate for the year 2012 was 4.2%.The national statistics office, Statistik Austria, does not produce economic data for the City of Innsbruck alone, but on aggregate level with the Innsbruck-Land District summarized as NUTS 3-region Innsbruck.

          "The Imperial Palace is a must for anyone interested in European history, and especially those into the Habsburg family. This palace is especially meaningful to the reign of Maria Theresa, the last of the House of Habsburg, and the only female ruler of their dominions. The",
          "Great to see all the portraits. No photography allowed saw a great modern art exhibition on the first floor had to pay extra but well worth it. Was the really interesting light hypnotherapy. You listen to music closing your eyes with a bight flushing light facing you. Your brain",
          "The building is pretty nice from outside as well as from inside. The main entrance opens right into the bazar with shops selling souvenirs and restaurants. Main exhibits are on the upper part of the building but there is a nice and charming collection of items on the ground",
          "We stayed in Innsbruck for 3 days and saw the Innsbrucker Promemenden Konzerte there. Each night, a different musical emsemble played. The concerts were all free and there was great wine and beer as well.",
          "In the heart of Olt Town the Hofbug was the summer home of Habsburg Emperors, most notably Maria Theresa. Much information and well appointed. Very informative.",
          "a nice palace located in rennweg, and best to visit during the afternoon it closes early. very nice deco of interior",
          "Lovely, gothic style palace. It was considered to be one of the most significant cultural structure in Austria. The banquet hall was beautiful, though taking picture is not allowed. It would be better if you ask for audioguide, unfortunately, it wasn't offered to us. The",
          "Beautiful palace with an interesting history. Audio set is free with admission and a must if you want to get the most out of your visit,",
          "Perfectly situated in the middle of the city. Beautifully maintained palace from a bygone area. Very well worthwhile visit",
          "This palace was initially built as a castle in the fifteenth century and then in the 1700s Maria Teresa rebuilt it in rococo style, as we see it today. You can visit the throne room, the imperial apartments, the chapel and the imperial gardens; but the hall that remains most",
          "We arrived on a Sunday, right at 4:30pm. The final admittance and were told to \u201churry\u201d! There was almost no one there which was delightful as everything we have done here has been packed! This was like a mini version of Schonnbrun Palace with really beautiful rooms that had been",
          "Amazing place with loads of history, well explained. Entry is free with the Innsbruck card and so we made two visits",
          "We only had 30 minutes walking tour. There is so much to see and do. Would like to just visit the city to explore on its own.",
          "This palace has several state rooms that are worth a visit. You can visit the state rooms with a guide, and afterwards you can walk around in the state rooms by yourself if you want to take another good look. We enjoyed our visit to this palace and the guide did a great job",
          "I enjoyed meandering around and had a pleasant time but am annoyed about the total lack of audio guides. We were there when there were few visitors. None available. You can read information in English but an audio guide adds to your understanding. It seems a problem they r well",
          "We paid \u20ac6.50 as seniors to go in....other adults were \u20ac9 and under 19s free. It was an interesting place with a couple of lovely rooms - quite opulent, but there were many many paintings which was quite boring for a teen! There was quite a bit or reading and there appeared to",
          "A bit repetitive, lots of portraits and not much else. Had a few rooms with original furniture. No photos allowed. Went because I had an Innsbruck card but didn't spend long there. Not a must see especially if you've seen the palaces in Vienna.",
          "Truly a delight to see and an honour to visit such an ancient treasure and masterpiece. Exquisite rooms and paintings that are a must see. My husband and I snuck in a 15 second waltz in the giant hall as we imagined what it would be like to be invited to a ball in historic",
          "Due to time restrictions, we were unable to explore this venue. Nonetheless, this is an imposing building and we understand comparable with places like Versailles and Buckingham Palace. If you can obtain an Innsbruck card, the entrance fee is free of charge. If you like",
          "If you liked Buckingham Palace amd Versailles you will like this. Gorgeous and Luxurious at every moment there. This is worth the money.",
          "The former palace is magnificent. Entry also allows you access to the temporary exhibition. The imperial rooms are on the top floor and are brilliantly decorated. There are also a lot of family portraits. What I found most interesting was the displays of furniture which showed",
          "The giant hall itself is enough to go inside, and see all of the attractions. There are so many restored room, which is available for the visitors. If you have got Innsbruck card, than the entrance is free of charge.",
          "The palace is open to visit as of May 2018, despite the entire exterior being shrouded and under scaffolding. It is E9 to visit and you can pay for an additional audio tour. No photography is permitted inside the palace. The lower levels house modern art exhibits and the",
          "This is located right in the old town and an easy visit. It is smaller than other palaces we\u2019ve visited but a good one to complete the set in Austria. We used our Innsbruck card to gain access which was great value.",
          "There doesn't seem to be much to see but if you get the auditorium you won't miss the small things you may just walk past, such as the hidden Chinese decoration. The giants hall tops it all",
          "Had high expectations from this one, but would not say it is top choice to visit. Of course a nice palace. but there are more beautiful palaces. The Riesensaal is impressive though!",
          "The hardest part is finding the entrance to this place . Nowhere on signs does it say Imperial Palace , it only shows signs to the Hofburg , confusing or what when you follow google maps it says Imperial Palace ??. Once I had worked put they were the same place I bought the",
          "Built in 1453 by Arch Duke Sigismund, remodeled in1755 by Maria Theresa who re made the Baroque south wing, the front , and the grand stair case. The interior is Rococco style. The state rooms on the second floor were completed in1773.The Giants Hall ( Riesenhalle ) is white",
          "If you need to complete the Habsburg baroque palaces, then this is another, equally ornate but built on a smaller scale.",
          "The weird thing is you start your tour here by acending bare stairs and through a couple of almost featureless corridors. Thinking this was a swizz we were about the depart when we opened a door and found an amazing giant gallery which had been the major events hall of the",
          "There was a temporary exhibit on Easter eggs. Pretty amazing to see so many different pieces from every country and forms. The palace is beautiful with very high ceilings. Pictures are not allowed. Collection is rich and furniture in very good shape. Definitely worth the visit",
          "This palace was the HQ of Empress Maria-Theresa and her husband. It has recently been thoroughly restored to its magnificent baroque appearance and is not to be missed. Photography is not allowed.",
          "Visited with my partner. The palace provides an interesting history of the Hapsburg family. It is somewhat odd that to use an audio guide they require you to hand over a form of ID. The tour itself is very interesting but some of the building seemed to be closed when we were",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the exquisite palace and grounds. A special treat was attending an evening concert in the courtyard of the palace.",
          "Beautiful palace which shows the royalty of the kingdom. Having lot of royal crowns, shields dresses shows how rich innsbruck empire was. It was summer xapital of austriA. A must go. Free with innsbruck card",
          "We had been the other 2 Hofbetg Palaces in Vienna, so this made the trifecta. It had some fabulous rooms that were set up and the Giant Hall was amazing. As the palace was not the full home if any royalty but a place to holiday in - much of the actual furniture is not there",
          "beautiful castle in heavenly surroundings - we got a cab up there and back it would be ideal to tie in with the Swarovski factory",
          "This Palace was lovely, very clean and well signposted way round and good clear information about the families that resided there. The great Hall ceiling was magnificent with strategically placed mirrors you could look through to see more detail on the ceiling. Well worth a",
          "Nice palace, you can find here memorabilia\u2019s of Maria Theresa and her family and also Sissi. The exhibition isn\u2019t too big so even younger kids will make it. You can rent an audio guide there but since there are written information in few languages everywhere, there is not",
          "The Hoffburg palace in the heart of the old city of Innsbruck is well worth a visit. Entry prices are cheap with children being free. There are quite a few large rooms in the imperial apartments to look around with impressive furniture and spectacular art work. Officially you",
          "I suspect I was very lucky as there were only 4 or 5 of us in the whole place! I can imagine it gets very crowded in peak times. This magnificent palace is a must for visitors. Incredible recreations of the rooms - detailed bedrooms; dining rooms; lounge rooms. I felt as tho",
          "Palace was favorite of Maria Theresa. There is decorated rooms. Historical memorbilia and the captions on the exhibits are easily understandable in English. I liked it alot.",
          "Must see,huge,splendid display of the royals,,,beautiful collection of royal art effects,magnificent chendeliars, beautiful Austrian glass.",
          "The Hofburg was right in the old town not far from the Golden Roof. Worth a visit as it is beautiful inside and outside. Halls were beautiful but won't take long to complete the tour",
          "We visited this palace today and it was jaw-droppingly beautiful! The great hall can be admired for 15 minutes or more (and we have a toddler who was happy to stay that long, so that's saying something). Beautiful.",
          "This is a beautiful small palace to visit filled with pieces of art, furniture and more of the history of the Austrian royal family. When in Insbruck don't miss it!",
          "Worth a visit. Loads to see and very educational. Staff were friendly and helpful. The main hall is a sight to behold, worth the visit all on its own.",
          "The palace is a spectacular place. Lots and lots of really nice Habsburg family portraits and the frescoes in the grand ballroom were beautiful. The furniture and clothing displays were very interesting. I'm a history buff and had read a couple of books about the",
          "There are some beautiful rooms to see at this palace but it is disappointing to not be permitted to take photos. Plenty of interesting facts about the royal family.",
          "...if you had visited similar palaces before, lets say just in Austria, like Hofburg in Vienna or Residenz in Salzburg, you'd fine this one nothing special. But it's still wort a visit, it will take you about an hour. It's mostly Habsburg history...",
          "We visited this palace to complete the trifecta that is the Hofburg in Vienna, Schonnbrunn and this palace. While not as richly furnished as the other two it was still a large and well adorned/frescoed palace. Tour comes with an audio guide but there are also plaques/plates in",
          "Very interesting audio tour in english. Fantastic decor and some furnishings. Lots of history. I was there in August which is a busy time, but because it is so large it did not feel that busy and a very short queue for tickets, 5 minutes. Allow a good 2 hrs to see everything.",
          "The building is beautiful from outside, although at the time we visited in July, there was some construction/ restoration going on around the vicinity. The entrance ticket is not expensive and there is discount available for teens ( or free, I don't recall). The lady at the",
          "I've seen a lot of palaces in Europe and this one is probably my least favorite. There is not a lot of furnishings, the audio guide was a bit long winded for some rooms and the history museum sections were rather boring with too much text. I would not recommend it for children",
          "Do your homework then tour or take a guided tour; otherwise it's just portraits of people. Follow with coffee and pastry at the Sacher Cafe!",
          "This palace gives you an idea of how the royalty lived in that era. It takes about an hour to visit the palace.",
          "This actually should be ranked as number one in Innsbruck. It is a fascinating palace. Plan for about 90 minutes in it.",
          "though we did not go inside the palace as we had gone past the closing timings , there is an open air philharmonic orchesttra going on everyday for free in its compound , till 31/7. do go early as all seats get filled up. It is really a treat to the ears and a feast for the",
          "Amazing rooms,curtains and drapes and furnishings all refurbished as near to the original as should be. Guides on every room to answer questions, just like in our own National Trust. We had to ask what the strange large urn like objects were in the corner of each room. They were",
          "There is a lot to see and some very interesting rooms/halls to look around. You will learn alot about the history of the city and royality.",
          "After visiting the imperial palaces in Vienna, we could hardly wait to visit the third most important royal residence in Austria. We were not disappointed. Well preserved and restored, this sumptuous building had several highlights we explored at our pace, especially the chapel,",
          "We paid nearly 7\u20ac for a senior ticket. There are lockers and coat pegs to leave your costs And belongings. You tour one floor of the palace. There are rooms that act as a museum with artefacts/ information. There are rooms that are displayed as they were used. Lots of",
          "The Hofburg ticked all the boxes. It was beautiful, informative and on the day of our visit \u2013 mostly empty. A big \u201cup\u201d to Austria for having senior discount kick-in at 60. At \u20ac6.50 for entrance and audio-guide, it was the attraction bargain of the trip. I normally decline",
          "I took this tour as part of a city tour, so I did not use the audio guide. My guide was very good and knowledgeable. The palace is quite impressive, but nearly as much so as Sh\u00f6nbrunn or the Hapsburg Palace in Vienna. Still, it's worth visiting, especially if you've never seen",
          "Hofburg is a gorgeous, grand palace which sits within the old town, making it easily accessible. The walls and ceilings are beautifully decorated with art pieces to wow you.",
          "Enjoyed visiting the Hofburg but beware. Take photo ID with you if you want audio tour. Our passports etc were in the hotel safe and we were refused audio sets. What were we going to do with them other than listen to the information? Hardly of use elsewhere.",
          "It is an imperial palace to walkthru. Nothing to see. Just a museum of art inside. Not sure how good it is because we did not visited it.",
          "This palace has been beautifully restored, and give an insight into the local history. The courtyard area was good for external shots of the palace.",
          "Our group visited on a very warm June day, so it was nice to escape the sun for a little while, although one gets a sense of non-climate controlled architecture this way. The palace was delightful, and moderately easy to photograph except in the largest of tour groups, the",
          "My first visit to the old Imperial Palace of Marie Theresa was over 20 years and I remember thinking at the time... why have they not spent a cent on this place - it is run down with flaking paint and empty rooms. Well not any more. Clearly the true potential of the long",
          "Place that can give you a rich history and culture existed some hundreds yrs ago. Enjoy the walk upto this place, beauty, ambience and fresh air",
          "This is an appealing place to visit though it has a very domestic 18th century feel about it - focussing very much on the Empress Maria Theresa and her huge family. The great Giants Hall is well worth seeing with portraits of the entire family, But otherwise it is pleasant",
          "The Giant's Hall is the high spot of this Palace. It's huge - big enough for 180 diners at an Imperial banquet. The decor is wonderful and thoughtfully placed mirrors let you view the ceiling paintings without cricking your neck. There are lots of rooms of historic costumes and",
          "Impressive... but I wish more of it had been open. There seemed to be some areas which would only be open for temporary exhibitions. Still, what was open was most interesting and I would highly recommend visiting it.",
          "Admission to the Hofburg is included in the price of the Innsbruck Card. Within easy walking distance of all the Old Town attractions, the Hofburg has a stunning ballroom and several beautifully laid out rooms to walk through and enjoy, along with multiple portrait paintings,",
          "I love visiting palaces, but this one is definitely worth going to. The audio guide is very informative, but the rooms really speak for themselves. They're exquisite. There are also many rooms to visit, which I feel more justifies the price of visiting ;)",
          "Sometimes while visiting these places you sort of end up not reading everything and walking through. However, there is so many beautiful items and intriguing things that make you want to read everything. There is always something that catches your attention and pulls you back.",
          "The Imperial Palace in Innsbruck really does stands out and it is definatly worth hoping by for a photo!",
          "We went to the Hofburg with our 4 children. They find palaces etc interesting when there is an audio guide but slow and difficult if you have to read every sign. However we could not get an audio guide as we did not have our passport or licence with us !!! We had a photo of our",
          "Very interesting building for anyone interested in pre WW1 Austria. The building is quite plain from the outside but don't let that put you of. The ballroom is absolutely stunning. When you are there you can only imagine what it must have been like to attend a candlelit ball in",
          "Interesting to see the various opulent palace rooms, an insight into palace life and some history of the area.",
          "I visited this castle in the middle of the city center as I didn't have enough time to visit the Ambras Schloss instead and I really liked it! The main imperial ball room was astonishing, in true Asburgic style, and there also were some beautiful pieces of art, mostly portraits,",
          "Included with Innsbruck card. A bit out of town but bus goes stright there form central station. Takes around an hour to see and is quite interesting.",
          "We visited on a quiet Sunday afternoon with the price of our ticket included in our Innsbruck card. We happily wondered around looking at the beautiful rooms and stunning architecture. We were so glad we made the visit.",
          "Hofburgs have influnced the city of Innsbruck. Just a few rooms but knowing the lifestyle of the rulers then is quite interesting. Elizabeth our tour guide made it more interesting.",
          "This is a truly substantial and obviously well maintained building near the park. I did not have time to go inside however was able to walk through the large internal quadrangle. Well worth a look!",
          "Worth a walk through to feel the imperial days. The hug ball room is beautiful as well as the connecting room.",
          "this attraction looks good from outside .. visited with family in april 2016 .. could not go inside the palace .. has a substantial amount of visitors ..",
          "Lack of time was my biggest complaint about Innsbruck. The imperial palace which we saw form outside looked impressive. It also houses the Golden Roof. I dont know if there is a fee to go inside but again due to lack of time, I was able to capture pictures of it from the",
          "It was about exhibitions that follow in the footsteps of big governors of Tirol, Maria Theresia and Maximillian I. From architecture point of view, it might be interesting place to be. Allow an ample time to visit there, I was rushed out by the curators when the Hofburg was",
          "The Imperial Palace is very impressive building, from the out side. Unfortunately due to lack of time, could not go inside,saw it only from the outside. Even if you do not go inside, it is well worth, just to see this impressive building from the outside.",
          "A residence of Maria Theresia and a tip for all museums, is to take a children's guided tour. These tend to me more interesting and special, plus you learn more fun details. After your visit it is nice to buy some picnic food in grocery store in the old town, on the left side of",
          "There is one grand space with interesting walls and ceilings, but the remainder of the palace is of limited interest in terms of furnishings and exhibits. There is an exhibit with the genealogy of the Bavarian kings that may make sense to Austrians, but made this visitor",
          "We have seen many palaces in Austria and the one in Insbruck is definitely not the best example. Yet again, one can not afford not to see it when in Insbruck. Is it worth the entrance fee? I doubt it.",
          "The Hofburg palace in Innsbruck is much smaller than the Vienna Hofburg palace and the Schoenbrunn palace. So if you have not already seen the two in Vienna it is certainly worth a visit. Concentrating on the Habsburg dynasty the items displayed here take you back to their lives",
          "Very nice building with furniture, paintings and an important story. Very useful explanations in Italian in every environment.",
          "We spent 2-3 hours wandering around the rooms in the palace looking at the exhibitions and reading the explanations about items we were looking at and the family that lived there. The explanations, which are quite detailed, are in German and English, so if you speak one of",
          "Some great artwork and a good audio guide around the palace apartment. Several sections are currently closed for refurbishments.",
          "a walk in the imperial austria. worth a visit. however there is not much furniture and the restoration did not impress me as most of the decorations and fabrics do not respect the original.",
          "On a rainy day in summer we visited the imperial palace in Innsbruck. Like the hofburg in Vienna, this palace was a residence for the Austrian royal family. After having visited the Vienna Hofburg, it was nice to see this palace as well as the exhibition here pays more attention",
          "The pallace shows a lot of rooms that have different functions and interiors. It also provides detailed explanations of the historical backgrounds. Definitely a great option for a rainy day!",
          "Whilst you can be assured about the Austrian service and honesty we were today surprised and shocked that whilst we booked our tickets at hofburg Innsbruck the booking clerk did not find it important to tell us that the audio devices weren't available? This inspite the fact that",
          "The pluses: Good explanations of what is on display; audio guide was helpful and easy to use too. Reasonable variety of things to look at. Lots of history. The downside: There was some recent history, but not much.Two further (smaller) exhibitions currently closed. Reception",
          "Of course this palace doesn't compare to those in Vienna, but it is still an interesting (and less crowded!) place to visit if you are in Innsbruck. The reason I give just 3 stars is that on my visit, 2 areas were closed and they did not have any audioguides available, so I felt",
          "As others have mentioned the Innsbruck Hofburg is not as impressive as the palaces in Vienna. That bring said, this is definitely a worthwhile place to visit during a trip to Innsbruck. The state rooms are nice, but I was especially impressed with the amount I learned about the",
          "I know visiting castles and palaces can become boring at times but I was not bored at all with this visit; in fact I was enriched. Not only are the rooms and furnishings fabulous but the descriptions of the history of the Hapsburgs and their successors and how the royalty were",
          "Hofburg Imperial Palace is a huge place with a magnificent giants' hall frescoes by Franz Anton. It like going back in time to witness the elegance and grandeur of the period. The furnitures, paintings and the enormous table setting are breathtaking. Look closely to see the huge",
          "This impressive palace has the most beautiful inner courtyard in Innsbruck. Walk through and around it to soak in the history of this beautiful city. The go next door to the beautiful Hofkirche.",
          "This building was very impressive. If you like to see the older buildings of Europe then this is one to see",
          "Using my Museummobilcard I took a stroll through the Hofburg. I must confess that I've been to Europe on many occasions and have toured palaces every time. After a while they all seem to blend together and one can become weary of them. Of the palaces, this one is absolutely",
          "History, good value for rest and wandering, spend your lovely and long hours here to be amazed by silk wall coverings in their big halls, different elegant rooms, especially the Pink and Blue rooms.",
          "Nicely done tour with electronic recordings that allow you to go at whatever pace you desire. Interesting history lesson.",
          "Good value when taken as part of the city Card charge. Some very opulent rooms now mostly restored, including silk wall coverings and furnishings. The Pink and Blue rooms are of particular note. the very large hall is also impressive.",
          "Take your time going from room to room. Especially in the beautiful big hall called the family room..gigantic with huge pictures from the children of empress Maria -Theresia..16 kids and other family members. The beautiful pink room. Pink silk wallpaper (?). Not paper .",
          "For a palace there was not much to see, you pay \u20ac9 to get in and it's pretty duff, there are a lot of paintings, and although they are amazing, there is very little else. Never worth the money.",
          "Innsbruck card allowed us to visit Hofburg Palace but we were not allowed to take photos inside. We only have a short time so the receptionist informed us what are the essentials we should see. We went to the Hofkirche Church where there is an empty Tomb of Emperor Maximilian",
          "Not as impressive as some other palaces we've visited. Okay to do as part of the Innsbruck card. There's a lot of rooms with not much in them.",
          "Follow the letters marked on the doorways around the palace\u2026or not as we managed to do! The must-see room is close to the beginning and is called the Giants Hall - you can\u2019t miss it The rest of the rooms of the palace were nowhere near as magnificent.",
          "I attended an Official Dinner here and all I can say is it was just superb. Highly recommended stunning and an absolute treat to be invited there.",
          "This castle is full of histories from Maria Theresien. You can visit her apartments and see how luxurious it was, especially considering that this was just the second residence of the Habsburg family.",
          "I enjoyed free admission with the Innsbruck Card. In retrospect, though, I wouldn't have bothered with a visit. Signs tell you which way to go, but the rooms are mostly empty. An impressive space was the Giants' Hall with its ceiling frescoes and oil paintings. I asked a",
          "Very nice museum. Must visit. Wouldn't take u very long 45 mins is the average Nice architecture and interiors and great commentary on the audio guide",
          "So beautiful. Its hard to imagine families living in this palace and living in such grandeur. Worth spending 1-2 hours - very easy to find.",
          "The Hofburg is one of the must-see palaces in Austria. The rooms on the tour are organized in a logical manner and the audioguide provides sufficient information about the rooms and the history of the Hapsburg family. The most breathtaking room is the Giants Hall, which is just",
          "If you are visiting Innsbruck for a few days get the Innsbruck Card. It offers free entrance to all museums and public transport, also one mountain lift return trip. After seeing almost all the museums in town, I have to say this is the best one. Get the free audio guide you",
          "This was a quick tour for us of the Grand Palace and it was so worth it, once you get to the Grand Hall you'll be so surprised!!!",
          "Having taught about Maria Theresa and Joseph II for years, I was blown away by the chance to visit their court. I had not realised that she had it in Innsbruck, in spite of researching her. As historical sights go, it is a little thin in places in terms of furnishing, but a",
          "If you are pressed for time in Innsbruck, this palace is not to be missed. I spent over two hours there and not only are the rooms impressive, but also the architecture in general, the items of furniture and glass on display and the audio visual which brings everything to life.",
          "My wife and I are enjoy visiting historic houses in the UK, so took the opportunity to visit the Imperial Palace whilst staying in Innsbruck. The palace provides a nice insight into the splendours of the empire and features some spectacular rooms and furniture. However,",
          "Many beautifully historically furnished rooms and exhibits which will not disappoint. Use your Innsbruck card here to get in \"free\". Only negative thing was an exhibit depicting the Anschluss with a warm greeting to Hitler.",
          "This place is good for architect lovers and nice to move around inside and it's a quite and calm place inside this palace.",
          "My group toured this as part of our Innsbruck pass. We were pleasantly surprised by the history and how well the palace was preserved!",
          "I wanted see inside Imperial Palace, unfortunately it was closed for some repair and would open in February. Very disappointed. Outside is not much to see",
          "There was a notice at the way in saying the place was closed to visitors for a fortnight \"whist they removed items from a previous exhibition\". It's pretty big, so did the whole place really have to be closed? Disappointed.",
          "This palace is AMAZING, as is all of Innsbruck. It's been a lot of years, but I'd go back in a heartbeat!",
          "Tidy and we'll refurbished.Beautlful mirrors hall and magnificent Princess Sissy's famous portrait. You will reach it on foot.it is just.at the boundaries of the small city old town and.in front of the Opera theatre .",
          "It was difficult finding where to enter. Once in, the palace is beautiful. There is room after room of history and beauty. There are no cameras allowed inside, and I did not like having to lock mine up in a locker. Plan on spending a lot of time inside.",
          "My husband and I visited while in town for the Christmas markets. My headphones didn't work correctly and they didn't believe me. I finished the tour without them. Still, glad we saw it.",
          "It was interesting to see the Palace, although there is not an awful lot inside, mainly rooms and pictures, not a lot of furniture. There was an exhibition running about 'death' which left us somewhat subdued.",
          "if it wasn't for Innsbruck card i would miss the beauty of that place seeing the princesses and queens used to live in that place ,, and what a great place be careful from the alarm while walking i did hit it few times you will know when u are there",
          "Until January, the palace museum is hosting a thought-provoking and insightful exhibition entitled \"The last things of life\" which explores the concept of death and dying. It uses the palace as an effective space in which to do this given that the Empress Maria-Theresa, after",
          "I visited this museum as I was interested in their latest exhibition about death. It was a brilliant exhibition for me but not for everybody. We used the audio aid offered at the information desk which helped you to understand each of the rooms in the palace. Alas it was not",
          "We visited this as it was included in the Innsbruck card and it was great to see the old Austrian empire at its best lovely old rooms and decor.",
          "The Hofburg is a city palace in the heart of Innsbruck. Easy to find and with the Innsbruck Card free of charge. The rooms are well decorated and in good condition. The explanation in the audio tour is very clear and interesting. At objects without audio explanation you will",
          "If you've been to schonbrunn palace in Vienna or Versailles in Paris, forget this one as there is not much grandeur to see. If you're new to palaces, then sure, you'll get something out of this one.",
          "This is a must do in Innsbruck. It's inexpensive, and beautiful. The tour comes with an audio guide that is prompted by numeric codes at each exhibit. This worked very well until the Hall Of Giants (aka The Family Hall) where there were no numbers at all. A passing guide gave",
          "admittedly, I arrived too late to enter the palace intereior and had to content myself with a cobbled courtyard stroll (and quite a courtyard it is), and a seat on a stone bench to enjoy my gelato and the many windowed view. However, I was a tad underwhelmed with the whited",
          "It is so soul touching to see these gorgeous building with so much history to them. This palace in particular though is beautiful. Don't miss it.",
          "The imperial apartments were wonderful. It was cool to see how they lived and the furniture and portraits. The exhibit regarding death and the afterlife was understandably morbid, but interesting. This museum also had english on the descriptions of items/paintings which was a",
          "Visiting Innsbruck, you cannot miss this beautiful palace. it will take you back to the old fashioned times of the Imperial feasts. The tour doesn't take too long, but it will give you a general idea of the court life at the time of the Austrian Emperors. After the visit you can",
          "The Hofburg is one of the must see locations in Innsbruck, but will not take as much time as some of the other grand palaces in Europe- most of what's open to the public is restricted to two floors, with exhibition space on the ground floor. The upper ballroom is amazing and",
          "Really a must if you visit Innsbruck and wish to appreciate the historical significance of the city. Plan an hour or two here and enjoy imagining life in Medieval and Renaissance times in Innsbruck",
          "We visited expecting typical tour of palace type rooms.however, I was pleasantly surprised by the temporary exhibition, the last things in life which explores death, it's traditions and how cultural attitudes towards death have changed how people respond to death and preserving",
          "Lots to see and learn here but you need a guide to get the people and timeline straight. Glad I went. Only need about 45 minutes and easy to find.",
          "We were here during a \"death\" exhibit. Very cool. Loved the palace ballroom with the paintings of all the royals.",
          "The first part of the palace is a temporary exhibit about death. There were nice pictures reminding you that nobody cheats or escapes from death. I quickly walked through since reflecting on my passing is not so interesting for me. But, one fun fact, it used to be that people",
          "Although not as opulent as some other palaces in Austria, this palace is worth visiting. There is an audio tour available, included in the admission price. We paid the senior rate of 6.50 euros per person. You are not allowed to take photos inside. The main hall is very",
          "From the outside, the Imperial Palace may not look overly spectacular, but the stunning interiors are really something to behold.",
          "This is probably the most spectacular site in the city. Use your Innsbrook card for entry. There is an audio tour which runs a bit long. The great hall is very impressive, as is a 36 meter centerpiece. The entire piece is not displayed. Furnishings are scarce. There is a lot",
          "Big building, centrally located. When we arrived, we think the building was closed. We were not sure if it was open to the public.",
          "If you love history, this is one of the best things to do in Innsbruck. And see their other palaces in Vienna. Interesting one!",
          "Overpriced. Managed badly and the staff was really off, on the point of overt rudeness almost as if they resented us even showing up there. There is an audio guide (free - but the staff wont tell you about it!) but the exhibition is such a mess it is hard to know which way to go",
          "We did without the audioguide as we had already locked our rucksacks in lockers and they needed ID to issue one (the only place in Innsbruck that asked us for this). There was plenty of information to read around the palace so the guide wasn't really necessary anyway. We enjoyed",
          "I only visited the outside as the museum was closed from 12 to 16 august because of an \"event\" taking place... a blow for tourism... The outside is impressive enough though.",
          "We'd see an greatness of the Habsburg Dynasty in each of halls. And we saw it! But unfortunately Palace wasn't whole restorated at moment, when we was there. But even all what we saw was amazing! Especially I liked a dinner table! It was awesome, because it's all more than 300",
          "This is an interesting place, partly through its association with Maria Therea and the later imperial family, and partly through its subsequent history from the war of Tyrolean Independence, through the Anschluss, up to the present day. As a palace, it is interesting, though not",
          "I haven't been inside this sight, but love the exterior design and architecture. Viewing it from both sides, and the dome too, which can be seen in a beautiful view down a smaller side street in the Old Town, offers a great architectural perspective!",
          "We've seen the Palaces in Vienna and this was very different. The Imperial Palace at Innsbruck - the Capital of the Alps - once was seat of the Tyrolean sovereigns. This palace contains five themed museum areas: Maria Theresa's Rooms from the eighteenth century, Empress",
          "I love castles so this was very interesting for me. The ornate architecture was gorgeous! My son was not so interested.",
          "We didnt go around the palace or musuem as we had out share of it during thsi trip to paris but what we loved was the concert we were able to attend in the palace compound. It was lovly and we would recommend everyone to attend it if they are traveling around the same time.",
          "I am a huge nerd when it comes to castles, palaces, etc. so I really enjoyed this stop. I love seeing all of the architecture and whatnot. I definitely recommend it!",
          "Visited as included in the Innsbruck card, but a little disappointing really. A large exhibition about 'death art' and not a lot else really.",
          "great place to escape from the rain and immerse yourself in the history of the Habsburgs, the recently restored hall is fantastic.",
          "Great interpretation and well presented. Close to the city and peaceful enough and surprisingly human. Your visit could be one hour or maybe three. Lots of fascinating information about the relationships between Austria and Lorraine (through marriage). You get the feeling that",
          "Our family had only just been to Versailles, in Paris in June. The interior rooms in this palace are comparable but here you won't be squashed for the crowds. We visited on a Sunday, that may have made a difference. We were just as inspired by the decoration and grandeur of the",
          "We found that all the palaces of europe are good, so is in India. we found that the entry tickets are costly.",
          "It is worth visiting . If you have not seen Hofburg palace . you have missed out the main attrcation point of the city and a part of Austrian History . a breathe taking monument",
          "Claiming to be the third Austrian Royal palace (after Wiener Hofburg and Schonnbrunn) in importance, it looks quite impressive in size and outdoor appearance. It is in the very center of Innsbruck. Although listed in the high value Innsbruck card, we couldn't get in due to some",
          "Beautiful old building. Most of it is empty. It houses a lot of old furniture but it is missing a true insight into its history. We enjoyed it but wouldn't make it a must if pressed for time. Sorry\ud83d\ude15",
          "The palace is now largely empty except for some dynastic portraits which are not very interesting. When I went there, it housed a temporary exhibition called The Last Thing in Life which comprised mostly skulls and skeletons! It was so gruesome and offputting, I am not surprised",
          "My sister and I got an Innsbruck Card and were on a mission to double its value within the 24 hours. We walked into the Hofburg and were in awe. The amount of original furnishings and artworks is amazing. The audioguide explains even the smallest details of each room and there",
          "If you like palaces you must see this. Not as impressive as the Hofburg in Vienna or Schonbrunn Palace but and interesting part of Innsbruck's history nonetheless. Make sure you pick up a free audio guide when you buy your ticket.",
          "The Hofburg Imperial Palace was a few metres from the Old town square and we reached in about 5 minutes. The entry is steep, but as included in the Innsbruck card which was 33Euro for one day. The state rooms are exquisitely decorated, and the Audio guide (free with entry)",
          "The appartments are worth the visit plus you get to know a bit more about the relevance of the city in Austrian history. It is quite small as well so reserve 1.30hr to visit it",
          "Nice elegant palace but did not enjoy it a lot due to restriction on photography and not really extensive exhibit. Am quite impressed though by the huge hallof thepalace with inricate paintings and frescoes.",
          "The Imperial Palace was easy to visit, and well worth a walk through. Ceilings and floor in the great room were magnificent. Interesting use of mirrors to highlight the ceiling.",
          "Great historic interiors and even better embedded unique dishes served at a local culinary culture. I would recommend very much !!!",
          "Definitely worth a visit! We were hesitating at first because the palace seemed too imposing. However it's well curated and the audio tour is informative and interesting. Do keep your overcoat on if you are there in winter as we were. There is not much heating so you would need",
          "My fianc\u00e9 & I went today after walking around through the beautiful old town & we were blown away by the beauty & history! A lovely experience & def worth the 9 euros \ud83d\ude0a",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit - a must see if you are staying in or near the old town in Innsbruck to see how the culture and city has developed over the last few centuries.",
          "though we did not go into the palace , we toured the outside and it was well taken care of . Gardens surrounding it were pretty.",
          "You visit the rooms as they would have been experienced by 18th century guests. Take time to imbibe the experience.",
          "The nicest part was going round by myself and taking my time but disappointing that parts were closed. Strange to hear rock music drifting from the theatre outside. The audio tour was OK if you flick through the boring bits",
          "I spent a wet afternoon in this very interesting Museum which documents the history of Marie Theresa and the Imperial family",
          "If you buy the INnsbruck Card from the Tourist information bureau then admission here is included- I would recommend buying the card as it gives you flexibility and means that if you aren't that keen on one of the attractions you choose, you've not wasted any money. I had not",
          "Disappointing as so very little is open. It must be a small fraction of one per cent of the building. A frescoed hall and a few private room of the Empress sissy. Cost is \u20ac6for OAPs. a free audio guide in English is provided with a lot of information but it doesn't say why so",
          "Happy to have spent the hour or so visiting the palace. It's central to the town and has a good audio tour. Admission was included in the \u00cfnnsbruck Card\" which I thoroughly recommend getting.",
          "I found my visit to the Imperial palace quite overwhelming. It gives an amazing insight in the lives of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth. Through the audioguide (tip: bring earplugs so you don't have to hold the Phone to your ear during the tour) you get a lot of information about the",
          "Why should tourist attractions be closed down during the period of the Xmas traditional markets ? Imperial Palace-Amblas Castle -Swaroski Museum - All off limits. At least we were able to visit the cathedral after 12.30 a.m., in the morning, also this was closed .",
          "We loved the silver exhibition! It was amazing seeing all the various silver and ceramic utensils used by the Viennese Hierarchy! The Sissi exhibition was very interesting, (although a little depressing) the rooms absolutely beautiful. Would recommend doing both tours",
          "The Hofburg Palace is a luxurious, lavish elegant and a must see place to visit. there are 25 ornate rooms to explore all wow's. The furnishings, paintings etc, amazing.",
          "Beware: in November it's closed and tourists are not welcome. The only thing one can do is walk around or pass through the courtyard which is more like a schoolyard than a castle one.",
          "We were surprised to learn how much Empress Maria Theresa liked Innsbruck and understood when we saw the Palace. It is a \"mini Schonbrunn.\" The one room with portraits of all her 16 children is quite amazing.",
          "This former Habsburg Palace, with over 450 years of rich history, offers the visitor much to explore. Five themed museums make up this Imperial Palaces collection and a free audio guide helps you better understand the political and cultural history of the Habsburg rulers here at",
          "we went to the Shonboun Palace and felt like we have been transferred back in time to the land of kings and queens. excellent interior filled with gold and silvers and lots n lots of old photography and potraits. a must for all visitors",
          "Not all the rooms are fitted out with period furniture but still well worthwhile a visit. The main hall is spectacular in the lavish decorations.",
          "One can pass leisurely hour's time at this place, simply admiring the paintings and artifacts... If you have a day card then worth a visit, otherwise shelling out money probably not recommended. Especially if you have seen Rome/Palace of Versailles etc.",
          "This former home of Empress Maria Teresa can be seen at a leisurely pace in about an hour, much longer if you appreciate original furniture or art of the period. Full descriptions in German and English accompany most exhibits. We visited at a senior rate of just 6\u20ac each and",
          "Our visit gave us a lot of information on the Hapsburgs, especially the grande dame, Maria Theresa. The audio-tours is available in various languages. The palace is spectacular although the directional signage is somewhat lacking. The docents are happy to assist in guiding",

          "Used our Innsbruck card to see this Palace. Easy to spend about and hour here and learn all about the history of the Hapsburgs. Queens apartments were very nice though almost understated when compared with the ornate decor of Versailles.",
          "- Good architecture - But was not that grand as were the other palaces we have een - Is very close to market and kind of almost runs into it - Ticket counter staff was warm",
          "I guess we expected a little more. It was nice, but I suppose we were spoiled by what we saw near Vienna.",
          "It is always interesting to see how the people of power lived in days gone by. They certainly spared no expense in their lavish accommodation! As this was one of their many homes, and not one that they spent a lot of time in, the number of rooms and things to view was limited.",
          "Our visit here was included in the Innsbruck card - we had audio-tours in English. The palace was very nice and the history was enjoyable. I liked learning about Maria Theresa and her style of leadership.",
          "Lookking for something to do in Innsbruck and having looked at the guide books, we decided to visit this \"palace\". What it really is, is one spectacular room and a few other exhibits. It only took about 15 minutes to go through the whole place and we were left feeling \"Is that",
          "First, it would help if the place had a sign to say what it is. A very large building, with signs saying \"Cafe\" and \"Congress Hall\" and a smaller one saying \"Hofburg\". On the third go I went in, yes it was the Imperial Palace. If you're used to the usual museum/stately home",
          "I love seeing the palaces of the Hofburgs. There were very few people there when we went which made it an even better trip. Beautiful palace!",
          "We went in here because we had the Innsbruck card and it gave us free entry. It was worthwhile seeing but we would probably not have gone in had we to pay. There was a separate Alpine exhibition which was worth seeing and rather interesting.",
          "Palaces beautiful only viewed from the outside , architecture very distinct. With the scenic beauty the palaces look awesome .",
          "Entrance was \u20ac6 and the tour including entry was \u20ac10 so I took the tour. The palace was beautiful and I found the tour excellent it helps you understand the context and throws in some bits you wouldn't necessarily find out. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and seemed to",
          "This was included in our Innsbruck pass. It was interesting but certainly doesn't have the splendor and furnishings of other more famous palaces. There are better palaces to visit and spend your time if you are planning to explore Austria and Germany further. Vienna and Munich",
          "If you have not visited the Hofburg in Vienna, this is a nice palace to visit, if you have visited the Hofburg in Vienna, it is still a nice place to see! My timing was perfect, a tour was starting and I was the only person on the tour. So it was a private tour with a very",
          "Having already done Vienna it was a continuation of learning more about the Hapsburg dynasty. There aren't many artefacts in this Hofburg (unlike in Vienna) but the audio guide is excellent - informative without being rambling.",
          "The palace just look like any big house from the outside, but improves when you enter the Court yard. There are some very stunning room and some nice ones so it is worth a visit if you are in the vicinity",
          "The Innsbruck card is a must, a no brainer, if you want to go up the mountain once. As an additional activity, with the card, this was interesting. Not normally our cup of tea, but we had time to visit, late in the day. The inside of the palace is beautiful, and you get a",
          "We enjoyed Hofburg so much - you will learn a lot about the Habsburg monarchy and their lives. Nice restored rooms with original furniture, paintings and decorations. We would love to visit Hofburg again.",
          "We liked this tour because you could go at your own pace and really get to understand the politics and economics of the country at the time of these rulers. Very good information for any history buff.",
          "Here you can see some of the most beautiful rooms, the ball room is truly impressive. When we were there there was a string band preparing for the night's performance which was lovely! It's a pity you can't take photos because it is one part of Innsbruck I'd love to see again",
          "Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos, even without flash, inside this palace. Pity but this is probably due to those who don't or won't turn the camera flash off. Even if you are going to visit, or have already, the likes of Schoenbrunn or Versailles, this smaller",
          "This Palace is something you should not miss at any cost.Superbly maintained old articrafts take you centuries back.",
          "The main ballroom was elegant. Since it just was redecorated, it was all shiny and beautiful. The paintings on the walls were of Maria Theresa's children. Their clothing was elegant and colorful.",
          "Some of the palace tours can be mobbed at times, maybe we hit this one just right. We took the audio tour and it was just the right length of time. As one reviewer said, dissappointing that they don't let you take 'flashless' photos. I didn't see the sign and got reprimanded",
          "Perfect palace for getting a feel of the Hapsburg reign of Tyrolean Austria. We got the audio tour but ended up skipping through a lot of the architectural renovations etc. as we had a time limit on our end. The Giants hall is really fabulous, as our the dressing rooms, which",
          "The Imperial Apartments consist of 25 state apartments dating from the 18th and 19th century. Originally of the late Gothic style (15th Century), it was rebuilt in the Baroque style in the 18th by Empress Maria Theresa. The Palace is also flanked by a set of impressive domed",
          "I have to be honest, I 'ran out' of things to do in Innsbruck and so thought I'd visit the palace. It's not huge in comparison to the other Austrian palaces (e.g., Schloss Schobrunn) but it was interesting nevertheless. I paid 6 Euros for a student ticket which included audio.",
          "This palace was much like many of the other palaces that we saw while in Germany and Austria, but smaller. If you have not seen many others, then I would definitely suggest that you go. However, if you are going to several cities with great castles and palaces you might skip",
          "This is not a long tour. However, the staterooms that are open are vey impressive and very well staged. The Giant's Hall is a work of art from ceiling to floor. Mirrors are placed throughout the room so one can view the beautiful artwork on the ceiling without having to look up",
          "Could have been great but the photo rules left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth considering that many palaces around the world and museums allow photography without flash. Only a book on sale at the entry kiosk is available to remember your stay. There are some postcards",
          "Good: -Cheap entrance ticket, I spent 2 hours inside! -Excellent audio guide! -Good location. Bad: -No taking of photos is allowed. -Because of the bad signage, there is a basement gallery which displays the portraits of the Imperial Family, but I saw many visitors missed it",
          "The Palace only has a few of the state rooms open to the public. I found the Giant's Hall to be most impressive. Also the story of the Hapsburgs and how the Palace was built. Included with the Innsbruck Card.",
          "A wonderful one hour tour to admire how powerful Empress Maria Theresa was , the audio guide was very helpful with lots of information about the Habsburgs , entrance fees covered by innsbruck card",
          "Obviously the palace is renovated but we really enjoyed our guided tour of the palace! The rooms and interior are visions to the eyes and you can easily imagine how the powerful of the Austrian-Hungarian empire lived before. Take an hour or a two-hour walk in the gardens to end",
          "Lots of rooms to walk through, and some temporary exhibitions also. Limited furniture with lots of alarms to keep visitors from touching and soiling the exhibits. The pink and yellow damask and brocade have very vibrant hues. I wonder if they are original or if they have been",
          "It was OK, in a stodgy gilt and marble kind of a way. Lots of portraits of bonkers-looking Austrian aristocrats and some fabulous state rooms.... guess you need to see it, but it left me rather underwhelmed.",
          "Dont miss it if you are in Innsbruck.You can join a tour in english.You can learn a lot about Austria from this visit.Let at least 2 hours for the visit",
          "wonderful visit to areas such as the family room, hugely impressive. And with the story of the family to bring it to life, signing up for the guide was a must. An empire comes to life.",
          "I liked the art but would have preferred to see more furnished rooms. The few that were furnished are impressed in my memory. The rich certainly were rich back then!",
          "Well worth the entry fee and the audio guide is excellent. Only downside is the lack of a continuous timeline.",
          "We were there on a very quiet day. At one stage we were the only ones in the Giant's Hall. A very pretty palace where Sisi stayed. Worth a visit when in Innsbruck.",
          "Be selective over the museums you visit if you're a young couple; as it's a lot to take in on a relaxing break. Make sure you visit this place though, the rooms are spectacular; and steeped in history.",
          "Very interesting, and the Giant's Hall is stunning. The Palace has thoughtfully provided adjustable mirrors, so that its easy to view the ceiling art (or admire your face upside down). There are audio guides available, and these provide an interesting overview of the Hofburg",
          "It was nice to visit the imperial palace's rooms (2nd floor of the palace) and the exhibition on alps' expeditions (1st floor). It is a good way to get to know the history of the family who lived there and the life on the mountains (when it comes to the exibition). It is an",
          "A must see on a visit to Innsbruck. But this is not an exhibition like some of the raters implied. We walked throught the room the Austrian emperors used for living when they stayed in Innsbruck. I find it like a little Sch\u00f6nbrunn, without the park of course. We got a quite good",
          "This church was AMAZING!! Baroque style church - so ornate. It was hard to know what to photograph. Right in the centre of the old Innsbruck and very easy to find. A nice quiet and cool place to rest and admire the architecture.",
          "when I visited the palace there were three things to see. (1) The state apartments which take about an hour and you get an audio guide with your Innsbruck card but you can't take pictures. The rooms are lovely and you get to see several of Empress Elizabeth's rooms. There is a",

          "If you've had a chance to see their palace in Vienna and the Schoenbrun, you would appreciate this smaller version. There were carriages to go around the town. Please don't miss Salzburg. The train ride also passes Zee lam see which is romantic with stream rising from the",

        "wiki": "The Nordkette, also variously called the North Chain, Northern Range, rarely the Inn Valley Range or Inn Valley Chain (Inntalkette), is a range of mountains just north of the city of Innsbruck in Austria. It is the southernmost of the four great mountain chains in the Karwendel. To the west it is linked by the Erl Saddle to the Erlspitze Group, to the east via the  Stempeljoch saddle (2,215 m (AA)) to the Gleirsch-Halltal Range. To the south it is bounded by the Inn valley. Its highest summit is the Kleiner Solstein (2,637 m (AA)) in the west of the range.\nThe Nordkette is served by the Nordkette Cable Car, which offers easy access to the ski area and the Innsbruck Klettersteig. The latter starts in the east, near Hafelekar station (2,269 m (AA)) on the Nordkette Cable Car, and runs via the Seegrubenspitze, the Kemacher and the Langen Sattel to Frau Hitt and the Frau Hitt Saddle in the west. In addition, the Goethe Way (Goetheweg) runs from Hafelekar Station along the ar\u00eate eastwards to the Pfeis Hut north of the Rumer Spitze. Below the Hungerburg - Seegrube section of the Nordkette Cableway runs the Nordkette Singletrail, one of the most challenging routes in Europe for freeride mountain bikers.\nThe following Alpine Club huts in the area of the Nordkette offer climbers bases for multi-day tours taking in numerous summits: the Solsteinhaus, the Neue Magdeburger Hut, the Pfeis Hut and the Bettelwurf Hut (in the Gleirsch-Halltal Range).\nIn the southwest, there is a small massif in front of the Nordkette, the Hechenberg, which reaches a height of 1,943 m (AA) at the Kirchbergk\u00f6pfl and which is separated from the Nordkette to the northeast and east by the Kranebitter Klamm.\n\n\n== Important summits ==\nThe most important summits of the Nordkette from west to east are the:\n\nGro\u00dfer Solstein (2,541 m (AA))\nKleiner Solstein (2,637 m (AA))\nHohe Warte (2,597 m (AA))\nHintere Brandjochspitze (2,599 m (AA))\nVordere Brandjochspitze (2,559 m (AA))\nHippenspitze (2,388 m (AA))\nBrandjochkreuz (2,268 m (AA))\nFrau Hitt (2,270 m (AA))\nWestliche Sattelspitze (2,339 m (AA))\nKemacher (2,480 m (AA))\nKumpfkarspitze (2,393 m (AA))\nSeegrubenspitze (2,350 m (AA))\nHafelekarspitze (2,334 m (AA))\nGleirschspitze (2,317 m (AA))\nMandlspitze (2,366 m (AA))\nGleirschtaler Brandjoch (2,372 m (AA))\nRumer Spitze (2,454 m (AA))\nThaurer Jochspitze (2,306 m (AA))\nPfeiser Spitze (2,347 m (AA))\nLattenspitze (2,330 m (AA))\nWildangerspitze (2,153 m (AA))\nThaurer Zunterkopf (1,918 m (AA))\nHaller Zunterkopf (1,966 m (AA))\nHochmahdkopf (1,738 m (AA))\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.nordkette-austria.net \u2013 Website about the North Chain",

          "Amazing views from the funicular and up the mountain. On a clear day you see Innsbruck and the Inntal in the Valley",
          "Always check the snow conditions before you go. Perfect for sight seeing but very few runs for skiing or snowboarding. When we went the snow conditions were icy and bad. But the view is worth it. Extremely expensive though",
          "The funicular is in different sections, so you dont have to go to the top if you dont want to. The low level part is not so interesting but once on the proper cable car the views are wonderful - it is just such a lovely ride. The cars are quite big and very stable so even my",
          "I don't think it was peak season whilst we were there, but this is a really popular funiculare! We only had a few hours to spare, so queued up, got the funiculare, had some lunch a drink or 2 to enjoy the view (as did a few others we met with short time). Wished we had more time",
          "The cable car station is easy to find in town. The ride up the mountain was spectacular. We stopped at hungerburg to see the christmas markets and the town. At the top of the mountain is a small restaurant and great views down to innsbruck. We couldn't walk to the peak as you",
          "There are not many funiculars in North America so when we have the opportunity to ride one we do. We rode this one in Innsbruck to then take the cable car to the top of Nordkette. Lots of fun and lots of people. We purchased funicular tickets in a space-ship like building",
          "One trip with a funicular and two cable cars..... A tad overpriced at \u20ac36 but the views are stunning and there are lots of trails to go on if you are so minded. The last car down from the top station is at 1700 so be car",
          "View is amazing from on top of Innsbruck. Did a little hike once we're at the top. Really nice. Nice place to view Innsbruck.",
          "Well worth the time, money and effort to go up the mountain. The views are beautiful and panoramic! Easy to do- buy your ticket online or at the ticket counter.",
          "The design is by Gigi Hadid and that was what is advertised but its like other funicular. Though we thoroughly enjoyed this ride as well as the ride of the cable car to the top but it is not something which is compulsory.",
          "We travelled on up the Nordkette Bahn to Seegrube where we were just in the snow line even in June. The cafe served good coffee and cakes but we were hoping for some easy walks around the cable-car station. Possibly because of the snow there was little signage so a brief stop",
          "Amazing view for whole Innsbruck. Breathtaking view up there! Not very easy to get to the peak in winter but worth every second!!",
          "We booked online ahead of trip. Very easy. Printed tickets at home. We bought round trip tickets right up to the summit of the mountain. The funicular is for the first 2 stages. The station is easy to find by the River Inn and the Hofgarten. Worth a visit in itself even if",
          "It was a superb ride to the top of the mountain. This is the start point to get to the top of Nordkette. The trains are on time and runs after every couple of minutes. The architecture is superb.",
          "Excellent trip, with the first leg being completed using the funicular to Hungerberg. We took a small stop at Hungerberg to take in the beautiful views of Innsbruck. Families with young children can also visit the Alpine zoo. Then on to the next 2 levels we used the cable car.",
          "You can take this Funiclar not far from the center of town. The station is quite interesting as it was designed by Zaha Hadid. You can go up to a nice viewing area and enjoy the views over Innsbruck. There is also a very small Christmas market during Christmas time.",
          "A mountain which is a must to go and see and won't even regret it as soon as you are there. With breath taking views. This for me was the perfect day to go see it due to the weather. Chilling outside and taking a beer \ud83d\ude0b",

          "If you are in Innsbruck then take time out to travel on the Funicular and the cable car to the top of the mountain. The funicular does not give the very best view but once on the cable car and at the top of the mountain the view over the valley is fantastic and worth the cost",
          "Wonderful piece of engineering, easy to use, clean, smooth and comfortable. Great experience crossing the river and then climbing the first part of the mountains. Great views looking back over the city",
          "This is a great way to get up the mountain overlooking Innsbruck and an attraction on its own - worth a trip for the experience.",
          "Located near town of Innsbruck. Ride to the peak was worth it. Very nice view of the entire town. There are cafes and restaurants at the various stations as one journey up. The ski resort is limited accessibility friendly, just need to approach staff.",

          "The funicular is part of the Norkettenbahn system that gets you up the Nordkette mountain. It originates at the Congress, near Old Town; stops at Loewenhaus, crosses the river to the Alpenzoo stop and ends at Hungerburg. From there you can take the cable cars to the summit.",
          "From the city you are taken up to Hungerburg where you can get your first views of the city below. What is great is the way the train changes shape as it goes up and down and all without you really noticing it.",

          "What a fabulous thing to do! From the hotel pickup to the simple but delicious dinner. Highlight was definitely the talented family that performed! Our whole family loves every minute of it! If you\u2019re in Innsbruck it\u2019s a definite must on your to do list.",
          "The kids figured out over the Internet the surprise that waited for them after dinner. They were grousing and moaning. But we all loved it. The most jaded kid (You must be joking) had running commentary going on her instagram. The surprise finale had us standing. And as an",
          "Great fun and a step back in folklore with this 90 min exploration into Tyrolean culture. Some great performances. You absolutely mustn\u2019t miss the cow call song ! Reasonable prices, great food and lovely staff (that also perform)!",
          "So my husband and I went to the show last night, Thanksgiving night for us Houstonian\u2019s and WOW WAS IT AMAZING! We accidentally booked the wrong night and they still accommodated us! We had a lovely dinner of pork schnitzel, potatoes, the most delicious creamy soup, salad, apple",
          "Innsbruck is a stop on our honeymoon. We have been through Italy, parts of France and Germany, and most of Switzerland leading up to this event. We had spent a lot of time on top of mountains and touring castles and were very much looking forward to delving more into the",
          "This show was a huge highlight of our travel experience. Family friendly...humorous ... and professional. Most quality travel companies include this event with their tour. Very highly recommended!",
          "The Tyrolean Folk Show in Innsbruck is a delightfully entertaining evening of music, dance, yodeling, and stage acrobatics. The show moves along quickly with a variety of acts from start to finish. You'll enjoy the energy and the skill of the performers. There is humor to go",
          "Excellent food, they accommodated my food preferences. Performance was great! Highly recommended for my friends for an enjoyable evening",
          "It was a great experience. The entire cast played different instruments, sang folk songs. We also witnessed some entertaining interludes amidst Austrian folk dance. It was 1.5 hours show but we did not want it to end! At the end of the show, the artists did a great gesture.",
          "It was an amazing experience. The amount of energy that was showcased was electrifying yet elegant. Towards the end of the show the respect towards all the nations was fantastic. Hope to be back soon.",
          "Fun and entertaining everyone was very nice. Food was great. Music was uplifting and beautiful. Would recommend",

          "The singers and entertainers were great. Funny and good. Worth the price. However the foid was cold and the pork was overdone and tough to eat. Pay for the entertainment. Skip the meal.",
          "This is a fun show with light hearted entertainment, much enjoyed by the crowd who attended. We took the dinner/show package and the food was fine, the show was worth seeing and the fact that they picked you up and dropped you back (for a small charge) made it very easy also!",
          "Great show.... lots of laughs singing and fun. Food was delicious. We especially enjoyed the singing tribute to all the countries of the world. Well Done.",
          "The room was clean, comfortable and staff was friendly and helpful. The parking charge at the hotel was a bit of a surprise but not unusual addition to the cost of the hotel for most European hotels. The plus is that there is parking available at the hotel.",
          "A great night out with our Trafalgar group (European whirl tour). Front row seats were the best. Exceptional entertainment. The most enjoyable night! Highly recommend to see this show.",

          "We attended this show toward the end of a two-week European tour with three young granddaughters, and it proved to be a highlight of our trip. We are happy we selected both the transfer and pre-show dinner options. Transportation between our hotel and the venue was flawless,",
          "This was one of the great shows I have seen showing real traditions by dancing and performing local yodeling while we have a great local dinner. I truly recommend this show and I am very grateful for the chance I had to meet such good people with amazing love for their local",
          "I'll be honest. We didn't know what to expect when we headed out with our Collette Travel tour group to see the show. I even asked our tour guide if it was a good show or kind of hokey, since she had seen it before. She raved about it...and she was right! The quality of the",
          "Brilliant evening x thoroughly recommend and highly entertaining.well worth it. Very funny and traditional",
          "We booked this upon recommendation by our hotel concierge. The show itself was good, predictably cheesy and will remind you at times of Clark W Griswold in Germany in National Lampoons European Vacation. The performers are all very talented so for the show we would recommend it.",
          "The food was good with huge portions. The show was outstanding. The performers were all very talented & the variety of instruments & dances was perfect.",
          "The show is fantastic, every song is different, amazing talent! They announce each number in multiple languages and at the end play songs from most of the countries represented in the audience. Only downside was the closeness of the seating-no personal space here! Bought the CD,",
          "This is a wonderful evening of music and laughter. Brought my 14 year old daughter and she loved the guys dancing. I loved the yodeling! Everyone was amazing. This evening was a highlight of our European trip. 5 stars!! One suggestion: put English words to the songs on",
          "We went to this dinner & show as part of a Trafalgar Tour. It was very authentic & wonderful fun!! The meal was good too - but we don't particularly remember what we ate as we were having so much fun watching the show!",
          "Pretty good show, funny and entertaining... A must see if you are near the place. Recommended for all ages",
          "This was an optional extra on our Trafalgar Tour. The 4 of us (our teenage kids came with us) haven't all enjoyed a night out so much in ages - we were all smiling, laughing and loving it! The food was good - we honestly don't remember it that much as the entertainment was so",
          "Had a blast watching the local folklore performance, it's a must see attractuons when you are in Innsbruck. Local talents are an absolute delight to watch as it is really unique to watch in this day and age that they still have the culture and traditional music and dance passed",
          "Just fantastic for everyone outside this locality. Consists of yodle, many local musical instruments, shoe slapping dances etc... Way more worth the cost. One thing, we just did not enjoy three course meal at all. I would avoid meal-included show. But a really good show!",
          "enjoyed the 2 hrs with food during the show! we were placed with table and chairs facing the show. They even sang a traditional Maltese song!",
          "The Gundolf family and friends have done research on typical Tyrolean music, and feature typical alps songs and dances. They play (and play very well) tuba, trumpet, trombone, double bass, harp, accordion, alpine horns, xylophone. The group was founded in 1967 over 50 years ago.",
          "great show!! a must while in Innsbruck. Great dancing. Rosie is great and so very nice!! You can tell how much fun they have while performing.",
          "The show, food and service was very good. It was a fun show. I wouldn't recommend it for all teens, but I'm sure some would appreciate it. It's definitely some thing fun to do /see on a night you just want to do some thing relaxing. I went with a tour group with people from all",
          "We enjoyed this show. If you are in the area for the first time, and haven't experienced a traditional folk show, I would encourage you to do it. The food was good considering the large amounts they were preparing and the dancers, musicians, and yodelers were fun to listen to.",
          "Very entertaining show! It was a fun mixture. Fun and appropriate for kids and families. Just wish I could have seen better - we were in the back.",
          "This is an inspired slap dancing/ tyrolian show. The music and dancing are just great. Humour abounds. The costumes terrific. A true snap shot of tyrolian culture. I thoroughly enjoyed the show.",
          "This family show has been featured on every TV show in the world in every country, and is fantastic!! The family is 4 generations already, and i suspect the show may not be around tooo much longer. Don't miss it!! And book a taxi home for after the show.",
          "My husband was skeptical about going to the show, but was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the entertaining evening. We decided to make a whole evening of it, and purchased the dinner along with the show, and were not disappointed in either. We made our reservation online,",
          "What a treat. It\u2019s a fantastic show full of tirolian delights. The singing and dancing is super. A must when in Innsbruck.",
          "Not knowing what to expect on our trip, Tyrolean Evening was a terrific experience. Yodeling, stringed instruments, Alphorns, they were all there. Very talented singers and musicians and instrumentalists. Several nations were represented in the audience and for the finale,",
          "We opted for the show, dinner and hotel pickup. The driver was one of the performers and the service was quite good. We hadn\u2019t seen a show in the Tirol fashion for many years so it was fun. We would definitely recommend using their shuttle and having the dinner package.",
          "We went to the show last night. Boy did we have fun. Every seat was full and we were squished in Abit. But we had a great night. We didn\u2019t get the food but got one drink with it. This is a must. I don\u2019t want to tell you much as you need to experience it!! Taxi costed us 12",
          "We attended this show as a last minute, spur of the moment activity, as it was included in the Innsbruck card. It was a fun show, with all the wait-staff very friendly, and the hall packed full. The performers doubled as wait-staff, announcers and ushers. While the caliber of",
          "A sympathic troup with such a good spirit : joy, friendship ans entertainment like in Broadway on the 40teen. Thanks a lot to all of you...",
          "It was an outstanding show Not to b missed It was the highlight of our vacation All the artists are immensely talented",
          "Had 11 of us from age 55 to 12. Everyone had a good time. Did not do dinner. Just drinks and the show. Talented cast. Very fun singing and dancing and great experience of the region. Must do!",
          "We have booked pre-show dinner and pick up service at 7:00 pm in front of our hotel. But no pick-up service did not arrive. We called the Gundolf Family to confirm. They told us that our booking is not confirmed in their registration. Finally they called a taxi for us with",
          "This was a fun night! The costumes were colorful, the dances authentic to Austria Culture and the singing and musical instruments were great!",
          "Excellent show.....we were planning to skip this showing initially since we were not aware what's it about but after attending the show we were so happy that we did not miss it.... otherwise it would have been the biggest regret of the trip....for me I ll remember innsrbuck with",
          "I was there with a group for dinner and show. We truly enjoyed the show part but unfortunately, the overall evening was tainted with a really bad dinner and even worst service. We arrived as planned at 7h00 and were rushed to our tables even if the place was empty. The salads",
          "It was a a great show but do not use their \"shuttle\" service as they just use taxis and charge more while trying fit as many people as possible into one taxi. So pay for your own taxi as it's basically the same price and don't have to wait in traffic squeezed in like a can of",
          "If you want to have a very traditional experience in all its forms, then this is definitely a must in your trip. The show is amazing, they do a lot of numbers with so much grace.... all of them are very talented and they do great with the audience. Very engaging and amazing.",
          "A variety of musicians with singing and dancing of Austrian music! A lady plays (shakes) cowbells to make melodies, a man plays a saw with a bow and its sound is very soothing. A fire scene with log chopping of the dancers is exciting! The pacing is impeccable. It's a must see",
          "Great show and atmosphere, a fab way to end a great few days in Innsbruck but be warned that there are two Sandwirts in Innsbruck - make sure that you go to the right one, hotel pickup recommended to avoid the same confusion as I had (which resulted in me missing half the show!).",
          "The Gundolf Family was definitely one of the best parts of our Innsbruck trip! They are all super talented and very fun to watch! We loved it!",
          "Wow what a great evening of music, dance and dining. From the pickup from our hotel to our return it was a fabulous night of entertainment. The 3 course meal was delicious and serving started from the moment we arrived with a drink and soup. To follow was a meal with snitzel,",
          "It was a fabulous show and Dinner ,very entertaining and funny .We also were transfered back to our Hotel after the show by Mr Gundolf.Thank you",
          "This show was enjoyable, talented group of performers adapt at playing different instruments and singing. DVD's are on sale at the intermission. I totally enjoyed the portion of the show where they sang the national anthem of the visitors that were present that night and the",
          "This event was included as part of our tour. The event was filled with tour groups from the US, South America and elsewhere. The show was a blend of activities and music based on Tyrolean folk arts. The staff works really hard but the show was a bit drab. It would",
          "What a taste of Austria and a great memory to to take home with you! We so enjoyed the talented group dressed in festive costume delighting us Tyrolean style. The pace went very well, and each act was interesting, unique and entertaining. I would recommend anyone visiting the",
          "This was such a warm, welcoming and fun night! Great food and company! Very interesting with added humour to see the different dances and musical instruments! The performers throughly enjoy themselves and your company! So glad we did this tour!",
          "Excellent show of traditional music with dinner. We arrived early and they gave us a good place and started serving dinner. A lot of fun and good music",
          "What a wonderful and entertaining show. We were so happy we decided to see this show during our recent visit. Recommend the transportation, as it was very convenient. Our driver was very friendly. To our surprise, the driver was also in the show!",
          "We had a fun evening! We especially liked the yodelling. We were touring Austria ad the costumes and musical instruments added to our Austria experience!",
          "We had a wonderful evening and greatly enjoyed the show of traditional Tyrolean music and folk dancing. The way the dancers intertwined during one of the dances made me think of an eggbeater or a couple of cog gears. They encouraged audience participation and recognized all the",
          "A good laugh will be had by all. A fun evening of song and dance and beer and wine. The show was fun and a bit cheesy but the 30 or so from our group that attended would go again. See the sights in the daytime and bring your family here after dinner to enjoy a multi-talented",
          "It was one of the best folk performances which i have ever attended, including authentic Tyrolean music, Folk dances and \u201cshoe-slapping\u201d as well as typical Tyrolean songs and \u201cyodelling\u201d at the Sandwirt Restaurant of Gundolf family, in Innsbruck. Everybody is an amazing",
          "We enjoyed the great entertainment, music and food. They took great care to make sure everyone was comfortable and was enjoying themselves. We weren't sure what to expect- and were thoroughly glad we attended!!",
          "We booked a dinner cum show ticket. In spite of the large crowd, both the service and the food were good. We enjoyed the performance - singing, dancing etc especially when common items like the saw, cowbells, wooden blocks etc were used to make music. The best was the ending",
          "According with our booking we are picked up by a taxi from our Hotel. We walked straight into the dinner floor. WE had a very restful full dinner. The dinner was very good and I can say plentiful.. The Show started on time and ..one after the other event was I can say",
          "This Austrian (Gundolf) family know how to put on a good show. It was a great night's entertainment well worth going to. Two free drinks were provided and then they were into dancing with thigh slapping, singing, ringing of the cow bell (fantastic), musical instruments, trumpets",
          "Visited this attraction on our stay in Innsbruck. The Gundolf family really know how to entertain . A lavish meal followed by copious amounts of beer and wine . Then the party began - a Tyrolean folk evening - yodelling , alpine horns , cowbells , dancing , singalongs. What a",
          "This was our second time to see the show. As always it was a fun evening of Alpine singing and dancing. Would highly recommend finding a way to see the show if you\u2019re in Innsbruck. They picked us up from our hotel and brought us back..",
          "The show was really fun and the family super talented It was a little bit more than 90 minuets and we didn\u2019t felt the time running Highly recommend and worth the money",
          "We enjoyed this show of talented performers. It gave us an opportunity to experience local Alpine tradition and culture.",
          "This show was definitely the highlight of my Europe trip! Enjoyed single minute of this show, the performers are so lively and wonderful! Don't miss this! <3",
          "This show is absolutely worth it. Bring the whole family because you don't want to miss this. If you think it is to far, just use your innsbruck card on the local buses and the brown 'o' bus will drop you off in front of the pub.",
          "Really good entertainment from a very talented family show It was hilarious in parts & the players are very versatile - each can play various instruments too Well worth the evening out",
          "We did not really know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised to a wonderful treat of traditional Tyrolean folk music and dance . There were good singers and dancers in their traditional attire and some of them played very old traditional musical instruments . Along with",
          "A really fun night, with very talented entertainment. This is put on by a family, and all the members get into the act. The only negative was the drink service. The waitress took orders down the table, but skipped us at the end seating. I assumed she would come back, but",
          "We attended the Tyrolean show on our last night in Innsbruck and we were not disappointed. We opted for the show+transportation package and were picked up my one of the performers at our hotel. The show itself was fantastic - a nice combination of traditional song and dance.",
          "Opted to do dinner before the show. Had soup, salad, schnitzel and strudel with a glass of wine. Considering they were cooking for a large number of people I thought the food was quite good.Then I moved into theatre for the show which had lots of singing, dancing and yodelling.",
          "I looked forward to tonight but it is a disaste! We paid for a meal and show...over 100 euro with 6 euro for shuttle from hotel thrown in. We arrived to an overy crowded and given seating at a table. Lots of trays of beer going around. My husband got a warm beer and I got a beer",
          "This place was so much fun, we had a great time. This was an optional tour for us, so glad we decided to attend this event. This was an awesome way to hear and see their traditional music and dance.",
          "What a fun way to be able to hear and see some traditional Austrian music and dance. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. We opted to have dinner before the show. When we arrived, we were promptly seated and served. There were two choices for the main entree which also included",
          "This show was amazing. The cast of twelve sang and danced. They played a myriad of instruments: trumpets, accordion, trombone, harp, bass, drums and several whose names I do not know. Two of the highlights; Rosie sang and yodeled a song about a cow....very funny and one of the",
          "This show was optional on our itinerary with our tour & I thought it would be a fun evening. I am so glad I went to this show. It was very entertaining. There was singing & dancing & different instruments & comedy. I just loved the whole evening. Definitely go to this show if",
          "Absolutely non stop entertainment. You get your money's worth. We had the dinner. I do not understand the ratings saying to skip the dinner. There is not much you can do to the schnitzel. It was like any schnitzel. The soup was good as well as salad and dessert. And if you have",
          "We were picked-up on time from our hotel and transported to the venue where we served our three course meal prior to the show. Schnitzel and strudel of course. Delicious. We were then taken into the main hall and were given seats near the stage. Well the show had everything.",
          "We pre-bought our tickets before leaving the states. The shuttle picked us up at the hotel but I don't think the driver spoke English. He dropped us off at the restaurant without saying a word. When we entered there wasn't anyone to greet us. We were finally shown to our table",
          "the highlight of my tour. this was excellent. we were picked up right on the dot and taken to the hotel. given a delicious 3 course dinner. then taken to the hall . the show was beyond my expectation. so entertaining. most of the dances were the authentic Austrian folk dances",
          "This was an awesome experience, one that I would highly recommend to others! We were picked up for the show and driven home afterward by Bernhard, who was incredibly lovely and professional, as well as being a very talented performer in the show. The show displayed a wide range",
          "We saw this show on Passport to Europe with Samantha Brown. Definitely a tourist draw, but a great family friendly show nonetheless. Everyone in the show did a great job. Singing, dancing and lots of different regional instruments. Whole family enjoyed the show. We opted to skip",
          "It was what you might expect wit singing and dancing in traditional dress but the meal was very poor, came from local supermarket I think, and the guest were moved to theatre and packed in like sardines. I had hope to sit at my table all evening with my son and watch from there,",
          "Our family of four attended the Tyrolean Evening. The restaurant picked us up at our hotel (for a fee), and we enjoyed dinner and the music all evening. The music was fantastic- everything from yodeling to authenic Austrian dancing and instrumentals! The performers were wildly",
          "The evening started out with dinner which was very good and then moved on to the entertainment, which was filled with traditional performances including dancing, singing, yodelling etc, all talented performers. It was a lot of fun, made even more fun by the enthusiasm of the",
          "For a party of 25 people, this restaurant took care of us without a problem. The service was fast and oh my goodness...the beer kept coming in. It was a lot of fun to enjoy the show after dinner. The famous, Rosy...Yodleyi Yodleyi Yo Ho! and also did it sounding like a cow.",
          "Absolutely Stunning Superior show,Wow wow,such talent,thank you very much,we Will be back,really a Must.",
          "This was a delightful show. It was quite a variety of musical happenings. Some singing. Some dancing. Some jokes and songs on folk instruments. The show came with 2 drinks and the server wasn't exactly cordial. It also got kind of warm in the theater by the end (don't know why",
          "This was the type of experience I was hoping for when I chose to go to Innsbruck. I absolutely loved this performance. The performers were very talented. I especially liked the zither player. I was amazed at how complicated that instrument is to play. And then there was the",
          "We started by having Dinner here and then moved over to the entertainment area. The yodeling and additional song and dance was certainly original and entertaining. Very enjoyable night.",
          "The Tyrolean evening is a must do .. we took \"the dinner while the show is on\" package and wud recommend it to families, the food was decent but the atmosphere was fun. We were picked promptly on time by a smartly dressed girl in traditional attire( later we found out that she",
          "This family can entertain you with dancing, singing, yodeling and comedy. It was a night of fun and laughter.",
          "We went with kids and they really enjoyed the show very much. The food was also good but not as good as the show. At the beginning of the show feels a little weird because it is very different to what we are used to, but after two songs we really started to enjoy the show,",
          "The family Gundolf does this every evening in summer, and on select days in winter when there are enough bookings. The family is talented - everyone has multiple tricks up their sleeve, and can sing, dance and play various instruments. The energy is captivating... and the kids",
          "Booked to see this show (Including the meal) before our arrival in Innsbruck because we wanted to see something traditional and typically Austrian whilst we were there - Here is my honest assessment of the whole experience: The Booking: We were asked to change the day and time",
          "We did the Tyrolean evening with a group. We opted for the meal and show. The beer was great but the meal quite bland. So get more beer! The show was unforgettable in every way. The time flew by as if seconds. We had a wonderful time and the show can be recommended. Thanks for",
          "Yodeling, dancing, singing and just plain fun. Although I did not have dinner the two beverages were a nice addition. I have been to many folklore shows. They are all a little hokey but this one had some very good musicians.",
          "Went for the combo of dinner followed by the show! The dinner table was cramped and crowded! The fare was very average served fried chicken and fries as the main course! the soup and the dessert was ok. Service is prompt but no second helpings or any additional items, have to",
          "The Gundolf Family show moves rapidly through instrumental numbers, songs, and folk dances with minimal narration. The ensemble has plenty of musical talent, but the show is not polished. Highlights were the yodeling, the men's \"slap\" dancing, and a singing saw. Seating for the",
          "This is a must. If booking through a tour this is a must do. Don't scrimp on anything. We had a wonderful evening and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. No cameras allowed but group happy to take photo at the end.",
          "I went there with my husbend and our tow daughters 4 and 7. We all love the show and will try to go there again if we have time.",
          "I went with my 10 year old son and we both loved it! We were picked up by one of the yodellers named Ingrid. She was super nice and drove us to the performance. After a traditional Austrian dinner we moved to the showroom. We absolutely loved the show, it was amazing. The",
          "The performance was good. They play up the tourists' mindset of the traditional Tyrolean character well. There are several different kinds of acts which served to be overall entertaining. We made the mistake of choosing the dinner and a show. The food was terrible and the",
          "Unless you like being confined to an extremely overcrowed room, don't go. The show is really nothing to brag about. You will feel like a herd being stuffed into a room that would be in violation by USA fire code. If you are lucky to sit in the front you have a good view, but",
          "After waiting for a taxi to pick us up for this show, we were surprised to be taken by one of the performers in her own car to the show and back to hotel again. The lady was Ingrid ,dressed in national costume and looked very pretty. Her English was great as we chatted en route.",
          "Over all this was a wonderful evening but it's important to remember that you are going here for the show, not the food. The food was at best average and the service was below average as they are understaffed for the number of big groups and tours that come here. Service was",
          "Hello, we did not have a good experience with the organization of this evening. The organizer did not contact us ahead with the details of taxi pick before the show, as stated in the conditions, and we had to call the organizer ourselves. At the end of the show, there were",
          "The show was great. Performers were very talented. We had 3 adults and 8 teens and everyone had a great time.",
          "So we booked the show package for here as we were staying in Innsbruck for 2 nights and we are so happy we did. We paid the 5 euro for hotel transfers to the sandwirt am inn (bit of a hike otherwise) and purchased our own dinner there (you can opt for the set menu also). After",
          "This show is a must see if you are visiting Innsbruck. It is entertainment from start to finish. The yodelling, and musical instruments played, and the dancing it was a great pleasure to watch it. Considering the lady yodelling is 76 years old, and does not look a day over",
          "You can book this popular evening show at your hotel's front desk. The show is at some off-the-beaten track location behind a gas station in Innsbruck, so the Gundolf's will charge 5 euros for round trip transportation by taxi to pick you up and bring you back. The show is",
          "If you love the region and its traditions or just adore hanging out with old people, you'll absolutely love it and if like me, you don't, it'll be so bad that you will find it hilarious. A five out of five coming from me and all of my friends (including the old people).",
          "I was a little worried this might be a boring show but my husband & I definitely enjoyed it! The performances were so entertaining & some funny. Luckily we got front row seats which made it so much better. It gets kind of stuffy & warm in there since it gets pretty packed, still",
          "My partner and I had a lovely time and enjoyed this show. The main girl is a fantastic singer with a beautiful voice. We just had dinner and a show. If you plan to see other things in Innsbruck best to get an Innsbruck card and it gives you a discount on this.",
          "This family, and the various other members of the band who are unrelated, are unbelievably talented. A true joy to listen to and watch. The variety of this show blew my mind. I did not know what to expect, but this was absolutely wonderful. Hands-down one of the best things I",
          "A little apprehensive when we first arrived-like a small working mens club behind a petrol station! Still unsure when the family first took to the stage-bit like Austria's Got Talent. However, stick with it and you'll have a great time! Worked their way through a wealth of",

          "Short time in Austria, this show is good enough to experience their cultural entertainment. Food is so so but it seems like it's free flow of drinks and we are talking about alcohol here. Good way to spend the evening",
          "This was an incredible experience that I would strongly recommend to anybody! A lively show that will have you laughing. A must do if in Innsbruck!",

          "The evening with the Gundolf family in Innsbruck was delightful. Tyrolean food was served at grouped tables. The authentic wiener schnitzel was the best I have tasted in the last five months in Austria. But the real treat came after dinner with the authentic folk dancing and",
          "This tour comprises of Hotel pick up , four course dinner and a 90 minute show which is really awesome . It provides knowledge about the folk culture of this area to the tourists. Although it might not be 100% authentic but still the hospitality and the vibrant atmosphere",
          "Do you want some Austria fun in Innsbruck? It's a must to come to the show. With everyone in the world on the move and families not together, it is such a pleasure to see and hear authentic music in the area. Soon all the traditions will be lost. Stop and enjoy the music,",
          "We really enjoyed our evening. We had a great meal (vegetarians catered for), with wonderful service and a lot of laughs. When we moved into the theatre, we weren't sure what to expect, and we were kept guessing all night. As one after another acts appeared, we clapped along",
          "This was a typical sort of show which I enjoyed the best part was the yodelling which I have always be a fan of we did not have a dinner included in our show.my biggest regret was I couldn't see the things they did on the floor and I would have liked the whole show to have been",
          "I just love Tirolean folk music, dancing and singing. And the Gundolf family does an outstanding job sharing the joy and love of life that underlies the music. This performance was the sole reason we spent an evening in Innsbruck during our recent vacation in Austria. Just go",
          "Yes, it's a little cheesy...and yes it's a crowded place. But honestly, we really enjoyed it. We sat with people from all over the world and enjoyed the Austrian culture. Both of us came away with a smile!",
          "We did the Tyrolean Evening Dinner and Show combo. We started off with a nice dinner - it was very delicious (schnitzel) and was better than I anticipated. After dinner, we were ushered to the show. My husband and I were laughing the whole time and could not believe some of",
          "Show that I went to 8 July 2015 was probably the best part of the dinner and show package . If u want the famous snitzel is not found here go to Vienna or even eat at your local pub. If you want great beer it's not found here, go to your local pub. Beer was not freshly poured",
          "I booked this through Viator, which i highly recommend! They picked us up/dropped us off at the hotel, and had our vouchers for the show and dinner. Whether it's family fun, or date night- this dinner/show makes for a festive evening. Yes, the show was corny and silly, but hey-",
          "If you're looking for an evening of family fun, you can't go wrong with the Gundolf Family. We ate dinner in the restaurant and then moved to the theatre area after. Dinner was typical (Wiener Schnitzel) but I'm not a big fan of veal so they prepared a separate chicken dish for",
          "We attended the show, which was really a lot of fun. We didn't eat, but did have beer and wine. The server was great. She made a big production when she gave my husband the biggest beer I have ever seen in my life! Everyone loved it. The show itself consisted of very talented",
          "This show was absolutely ridiculous, but not necessarily in a bad way. As someone having lived in a German speaking country for almost a year it came across rather unauthentic: this is purely a tourist trap. It is honestly the corniest thing I have ever seen and almost slightly",
          "Took my ma on a quick tour through Europe and surprisingly, she remembered Innsbruck well because of this show. This show is really for all ages. We went for the dinner option and it was good.",

          "Bought tickets with the innsbruck card so we got 20% off which was great. We bought show with drink ticket. Obviously all tourist things are trying to maximise their profits by getting as many people in. And it was a great show with a full house so good on them. But it was at",

          "Overall I did enjoy the evening, but felt that many of the performers, while very talented, didn't have their heart in it, that they were just going through the motions. I can imagine how they must feel doing the same performance night after night. Having seen it, and",

          "What a great way to be introduced to music and dance from the area. We went as a group and got to sit right up front so we didn't miss anything including a few wood chips thrown our way. We were given a couple of drinks, beer, wine or soft drink. We laughed and yodeled along",

          "A very varied show- competent musicians and singers. Two free drinks help to loosen everybody up and enter into the spirit of things. The men in their lederhosen are a sight to behold as is their dancing. And wait for the lady singer who sings about a cow! Loved the last bit",

          "One disadvantage of traveling on a motorcoach tour is the need to find your own transportation for individual pursuits. When researching Innsbruck, I learned about the Tyrolean Evenings with the Gundolf Family. The selling point for me was the 4 Euro roundtrip transportation",
          "The folk-dancing, singing and the playing of the instruments was truly amazing and had everyone clapping (or slapping) along. An enjoyable night except the number of people in the hall which was packed which during a heatwave was not comfortable and drinks were not easy to come",

          "Alright so yes this is a unique evening. We went with our two kids who are ten and eleven. If you can get through the odd location, meal and seating the night is well worth it. The folks putting on the show truly put their heart into the show. Yes the cultural center is located",
          "You need to have a few drinks before and during the show to find it funny. The show is sooo corny and the performers looked like they were dying of embarrassment... to begin with. Then the show warmed up and ended up really capturing the audience. It became one big party of",

          "We spent the evening here as part of an 'optional extra' on a European tour we took. DInner was included as part of the 'package'. Dinner was a good hearty traditional Tyrolean dinner - schnitzel and veges, beer and wine, dessert - no five star but it was great for what it",
          "We went to the show as part of a bus tour and couldn't have been more thrilled with the show.. An excellent night of entertainment by the Gundolf Familie..All the yodeling, musical instruments, dancing and singing made the evening extremely enjoyable. The talents of the family",
          "Did not go for the food and got what was expected. One needs to be reasonable as to dining expectations for any theater and it was no better or worse than other theater/dinner combinations experienced. Was delighted with the show as it is unique and not redundant from others",
          "We booked this evening through our hotel and were looking forward to an authentic evening of Austrian food, music and dancing. We had the dinner with show, and dinner was at 7.00PM. Contrary to their publicity we were told what we would be eating rather than choosing courses",
          "Enjoyed the Tyrolean entertainment - nice experience. And the dinner was very good. We arranged for hotel pick-up which arrived a little later than expected leading us to wonder if we would make the show in time. It probably would make more sense if they indicated a time range",
          "We went with cautious feelings about what the evening would bring but we thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The Famile Gundolf entertained us with so many different musical media coupled with some traditional Austrian Dance - what a delight. We had yodeling, oompah bands, piano",
          "i am an innsbruck native, but living outside of innsbruck for the past 20+ years. this family has been entertaining visitors to innsbruck for as long as i know, and are doing a real good job at it. if you go to innsbruck and you like the \"oktoberfest\" style music and dance"

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

          "Just lovely to wander around. Nice photo opportunities with mountains behind. Easily accessible from main station and a number of tram stops.",
          "Less interesting old town than Salzburg but still worth a visit with panorama of Tyrol mountain range, the Innsbruck old town is as picturesque as Salzburg. It is very crowded during summer but also very hot. Some interesting places such as Golden Roof, the Cathedral, Hofburg",

          "Was dissapointed with the old city in Innsbruck compared to other similar cities, thought it would be more like Salzburg but was not even close. There is a small altstadt here with some things to walk and see and the river running through town is pretty but overall not much to",

          "Many a time have we enjoyed visiting the Winter markets just on the edge of the old town and right through the centre of it. There are plenty of curiosity shops and lots of local delicacies to try. From street entertainers to a quick look at the Golden Roof. Pretty but not",

          "Once you are in Innsbruck, don't miss to walk in a downtown, or old town, just near the river of Inn. The combine of gothic arcs and painted facades of the houses are beautiful, and do not forget to see the famous Golden roof. Nearby is the Swarowsky shop, the original one, it",

          "We were only in Innsbruck for a couple of hours so we went to Old Town. The architecture is similar to other places in Europe, interesting and fun to explore. It is easy to go to Herzog Friedrich Strasse 15, locate the Gold Roof iconic structure and use that as your meet point.",
          "The Old Town of Innsbruck is really nice and like from a fairy tale of the middle ages. The houses are painted colourfully and have plenty of nice details to discover, so it is worth to lift your head and look up the buildings. Unfortunately the Old Town is really crowded by",

          "Visited when the Christmas markets were on, making everything even more special. The old city features all the Baroque architecture you would expect in an Austrian city, but turn a corner and there are the Nordkette mountains towering over the golden rooftops and cathedrals.",
          "We made a half-day stop in Innsbruck and one the places we wanted to see was definitely the historic centre. It is very charming with a lot of bars to have a coffee and to relax.",
          "This is a nice place to wander through although the shops are quite disappointing. Most of them sell cheap tat although there are some good Austrian cuckoo clocks. You can also buy a kitchen witch! There are a few coffee shops with sheepskins covered seats in the winter. The",

          "The Altstadt of Innsbruck is really charming. Worth the stroll and it was compact to be covered in a quick stroll before hopping to our connecting train. What is really charming is the mountain background that it has almost with each of each tiny streets.",
          "Most houses are from around 1500. They are individually designed and quite stylish. Given the Age of the buildings it is positively surprising that you never feel too \"squeezed\". The quarter is clean which is not always the case in old quarters. In the old buildings you find",

          "The focus is the Golden Roof above a C15th building at the end of a square, which has other ancient buildings. It attracts lots of visitors, and is featured on Austrian stamps at present. If it looks in shadow, just walk around a bit and return later, when the sun shines on it.",

        "wiki": "Seefeld in Tirol is an old farming village, now a major tourist resort, in Innsbruck-Land District in the Austrian state of Tyrol with a local population of 3,312 (as of 1 January 2013). The village is located about 17 km (11 mi) northwest of Innsbruck on a plateau between the Wetterstein mountains and the Karwendel on a historic road from Mittenwald to Innsbruck that has been important since the Middle Ages. It was first mentioned in 1022 and since the 14th century has been a pilgrimage site, benefiting not only from the visit of numerous pilgrims but also from its stacking rights as a trading station between Augsburg and the Venice. Also since the 14th century, Tyrolean shale oil has been extracted in the area. Seefeld was a popular holiday resort even before 1900 and, since the 1930s, has been a well known winter sports centres and amongst the most popular tourist resorts in Austria. The municipality, which has been the venue for several Winter Olympics Games, is the home village of Anton Seelos, the inventor of the parallel turn.\nWith more than one million overnight stays each year, it is one of the most popular Tyrolean tourist destinations especially for skiing in winter, but also for walking holidays in the summer.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nTo the northwest Seefeld borders on Leutasch (village of Weidach), to the northeast on Scharnitz (village of Gie\u00dfenbach). Its eastern municipal boundary with Zirl runs along the ar\u00eate from the Seefelder Joch and Seefelder Spitze. To the south lies Reith (village of Auland) and to the west Telfs (village of M\u00f6sern).\n\n\n=== Distances ===\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe village is situated on the south-facing Seefeld Plateau north of the River Inn on the watershed between the basins of the Inn and the Isar. The plateau (which also comprises the villages of Leutasch, Reith, Scharnitz and M\u00f6sern) is surrounded by the Wetterstein mountain range to the west, and the Karwendel mountain range to the east; it falls away in a steep drop off to the Inn valley to the south. To the north, the high valley leads through the village of Scharnitz towards the border with Germany at Mittenwald.\n\nSeefeld has two main mountain areas (for walking or skiing): one is the rounded hill, the Gschwandtkopf (1,495 m); the other is on the slopes of the mountains to the east and called the Rossh\u00fctte after the large mountain restaurant halfway up. These mountains dominate the Seefeld Plateau; from left/north to right/south, they are the Seefelder Joch, Seefelder Spitze (2,215 m), H\u00e4rmelekopf (2,224 m) and Reither Spitze (2,374 m). Notable other landmarks include the Seekirchl, a small, onion-domed church, and the Pfarrh\u00fcgel, a spur of the Gschwandtkopf running into the town centre and forming a small attractive hill. There is also a popular bathing lake called the Wildsee.\n\n\n=== Lakes and streams ===\n\nOn the east side of the Seefelder Joch rise the tributaries of the Haglbach, which flows west through the valley of Hermannstal, then swings south on reaching the plateau to run along the municipal boundary and feed the Wildsee. The Wildsee is threatened by sediment deposition from the Haglbach. In future it is planned to excavate a reservoir east of Innsbrucker Stra\u00dfe to collect these sediments. The tailstream of the Wildsee, now called the Seebach, runs through Seefeld in a northerly direction and collects the waters of the Raabach shortly after passing the village centre. This section was called the M\u00fchlbach by Peter Anich in 1762.\nThe Raabach has its source in the southeast near the M\u00f6sern M\u00e4hder and was once impounded to form a reservoir that gave the church of Seekirchl its name. Below the Schlossberg, near the Seebach, is a radon-containing spring, that, under the name of the Franz Josef Spring, was mentioned in 1900 for the first time in the Directory of Spas of the Imperial-Royal Province of Tyrol and Vorarlberg (Verzeichnis der Kurorte und B\u00e4der der K.K. Statthalterei f\u00fcr Tirol und Vorarlberg) and used until 1984 as a health spring. Its radon content of \n117 becquerels per litre is rather low (the limit for drinking water is 1,000 Bq/l).\nThe Klammbach originates at the Wildmoosalm below the lake of Wildmoossee and runs northwest of the village on the far side of the Geigenb\u00fchel, passes the Triendls\u00e4ge (where there is a reservoir with a capacity of 450 m\u00b3 which supplies a small hydropower station generating 45 kW) and merges with the Seebach by the Lehenwald woods in front of the Bodenalm to form the Drahnbach. The latter flows towards  Scharnitz and empties into the Isar tributary, the Gie\u00dfenbach.\n\nThe reservoir at 1,578 m above sea level (AA) near the Rossh\u00fctte (called the Kaltwassersee and named after the local area) has a capacity of 66,500 m\u00b3 and receives its water from the public mains. In 2015 it was additionally fed between April and August from the Blauer Schrofen spring below the Seefelder Spitze. The additional water from the Kaltwassersee for snowmaking was raised in 2009 from 100,000 m\u00b3 to 165,000 m\u00b3 per year.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n\nParish and pilgrimage church of St. Oswald\nFormer Augustine monastery west of the church, today a five-star hotel.

A cross potent has been inscribed later\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Rail services ===\n\nSeefeld is on the Karwendel Railway with links to Munich via Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Innsbruck. It is also served by S-Bahn line 5 from Innsbruck to Scharnitz (to Garmisch-P.). From the start of the winter timetable in 2010, Seefeld station became the highest Intercity-Express (ICE) stop in Europe. At weekends it is served by two ICE trains in each direction daily (2014 timetable).\n\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThree bus routes run by the Tyrol Transport Association stop in Seefeld, as does a long distance bus route (at the Rossh\u00fctte bus stop):\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nThe Bundesstra\u00dfe 177 federal highway (Seefelder Strasse) to the German border is part of the European route E 533. It runs from \nZirl over the Zirler Berg to Scharnitz and Mittenwald. Another road link from the Inn valley runs from Telfs via M\u00f6sern, along the road to Leutasch and enables Mittenwald to be reached over the Scharnitz Pass.\nInnsbruck Airport lies about 20 km from Seefeld. In winter there are direct flights from e. g. Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne and Frankfurt.\n\n\n=== Communication and telecommunication ===\nThe pilot project by Telesystem Tirol for cable TV was conducted in 1975 by a family firm based in Auland. Today about 900 participants in Seefeld and Reith are connected. DVB-T is transmitted by a  transmitter on the Gschwandtkopf.\nBroadband access and HSPA is available in the entire permanent settlement of Seefeld at a rate of 42.2 MBit/s. It is naked DSL with symmetric bandwidth of up to 20 Mbit/s, ADSL up to 30 Mbit/s. Broadband internet is also provided over the cable network. Since August 2012 there has been free WLAN access in the pedestrian zone, the spa park, the sport and congress centre, around the Seekirchl and at the Casino Arena, around the ski jumps on the Gschwandtkopf and at several stations in the Rossh\u00fctte ski area.\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\n\nIn recent years Seefeld has expanded and renovated its sports facilities and positioned itself as the Nordic Competence Centre (Nordisches Kompetenzzentrum) for the training of national teams and clubs as well as the Stams Skiing Grammar School (Skigymnasium Stams).\n\nToni Seelos Olympic Ski Jumps in the Casino Arena on the northwest slopes of the Gschwandtkopf (HS 109 und HS 75)\nBiathlon stand with 30 firing points\n279 km of runs for cross-country skiing, 125 km of which is for skating and 154 km for classic cross-country skiing\nAsphalt roller skiing route with a length of 3.6 km and width of 3 m with variations from 560 m to 4.7 km\nFIS-homologated courses for slalom and giant slalom on the Gschwandtkopf \nSki areas of Rossh\u00fctte, Gschwandtkopf and Geigenb\u00fchel-/Birkenlifte\nIce rinks for skating and Bavarian curling\nTwo grass areas for football, another is planned\nWM Halle with 8 indoor tennis courts and 4 outside courts\nSeefeld Tennis Club with 6 clay courts\nGolf courses: Seefeld-Reith Golf Club (9 hole, par 70) and Panorama golf course of am Geigenb\u00fchel, an 18-hole course in Wildmoos (Telfs)\n266 km waymarked running and Nordic walking routes\n570 km  of cycling and mountain bike routes\nBeach volleyball court\nTwo riding halls with outdoor riding paddocks\nFitness studio\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nSeefeld is an important centre for cross-country skiing. The Nordic events at both the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics were hosted at Seefeld. Competitions during the 1933, 1985 and 2019 FIS Nordic Skiing World Championships also took place here. In both the Winter Olympics and the 1985 World Championships only the normal hill in ski jumping took place in Seefeld, the large hill took place in Innsbruck) as well as some of the events at the 1st Winter Youth Olympic Games in January 2012. World Cup competitions have been located here a number of times. During the 2019 World Championships, ski jumping took place in Seefeld in Tirol.\nThe 1963 Biathlon World Championships also took place in Seefeld in Tirol.The alpine skiing area is small and appropriate for beginners. There are two separate small areas which are not connected except by a ski bus (free of charge) or taxis. The terrain itself is quite good and there is good access to other facilities (walks, shops and the Olympia swimming complex).\nSeefeld is popular with walkers because of its plateau location; there are many attractive walks which don't depend on climbing up and down mountains. However, the walks into the mountains are beautiful too, especially since the Karwendel is a huge nature reserve. Recommended walks include down through the Schlossbachklamm to Hochzirl (then the train back), and from the cable car stations down into the Eppzirlertal (if you're fairly fit). There are possibilities for multi-day walks through the Karwendel towards the Achensee.\nTogether with eleven other towns Seefeld is a member of the community Best of the Alps.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAnton Seelos (1911\u20132006) was an Austrian alpine skier and world champion. In the 1930s, Seelos invented the parallel turn. The Toni-Seelos-Olympiaschanze in Seefeld in Tirol is named after him.\nRegina Sch\u00f6pf (1935\u20132008) was an Austrian alpine skier who competed in the 1956 Winter Olympics. She was born in Seefeld\nJan-Carl Raspe (1944-1977) was a member of the German militant group the Red Army Faction. Raspe was born in Seefeld. He co-founded Kommune II in 1967 and joined the Red Army Faction, also known as the \"Baader-Meinhof Gang\" in 1970\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n1964 Winter Olympics official report. pp. 95\u2013103.

        "wiki": "Chal Mere Bhai(translated: Come on, my brother) is a 2000 Indian Hindi comedy film. The film was produced by Nitin Manmohan and directed by David Dhawan. It stars Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan and Karishma Kapoor in the lead roles. This was Karisma's fourth time in a row playing a character with the name Sapna.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThis is the story of two brothers, Vicky (Sanjay Dutt) and Prem Oberoi (Salman Khan) and how their lives are turned upside down by a girl named Sapna (Karishma Kapoor).\nVicky is a business tycoon who runs his family's huge business empire. Sapna applies for the position of his secretary. She is an orphan who has just moved to Bombay from Pune and is currently living with her uncle and aunt (Himani Shivpuri). Sapna doesn't have the required experience to be Vicky's secretary, but Vicky's father, Balraj Oberoi (Dalip Tahil) is impressed by Sapna's passion and hires her.\nPrem is an aspiring actor, much to the chagrin of Balraj, who would like Prem to also work for the family business.  However, Prem's grandmother (Sushma Seth) and Vicky support Prem's decision to be an actor. He works with a theater director (Shakti Kapoor) who happens to be Sapna's uncle.\nSapna is very inefficient at work and Vicky is completely sick of her. But when Vicky is attacked after work, it is Sapna's fast thinking that saves his life. Vicky's family invite her and her family to a short vacation on their farmhouse. Vicky's family become quite fond of Sapna. Prem and Sapna also fall in love during this time.However, before Prem can tell his family that he loves Sapna he finds out that his grandmother wants Vicky to marry Sapna and that Vicky has agreed to the proposal. Prem doesn't want to break his brother's heart. Vicky has been grieving for his late girlfriend (Sonali Bendre) for a very long time. Prem doesn't want to get in his way now that Vicky has finally decided to move on. Prem tells Sapna that he was just fooling around with her. A heartbroken Sapna gives in to the pressure of her aunt and uncle and agrees to marry Vicky. However, Vicky finds out the truth before the wedding and calls them out. Sapna and Prem are reunited at the end. The last scene implies that Vicky finds love again when a new girl (Twinkle Khanna) joins his office.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSanjay Dutt as Vikram \"Vicky\" Oberoi\nSalman Khan as Prem Oberoi\nKarishma Kapoor as Sapna Mehra\nDalip Tahil as Balraj Oberoi\nSushma Seth as Dadima, Vicky & Prem's Grandmother\nShakti Kapoor as Mamaji, Sapna's Uncle\nRavi Baswani as Waiter in Guest Appearance\nAnil Dhawan as Doctor in hospital\nBirbal as Astrologer\nHimani Shivpuri as Mamiji, Sapna's Aunt\nShahbaz Khan  as Rakesh\nGhanshyam Rohera as Nandu, the cook\nJaved Khan as Murari\nShashi Kiran as Suri\nAsrani as Family doctor\nNagma as Sonia in Guest Appearance\nSonali Bendre as Piya, Vicky's beloved in Guest Appearance\nTwinkle Khanna as Pooja, Guest Appearance\nShankar Mahadevan as Himself in Title sequence\nLesle Lewis as Himself in Title sequence\nSatish Kaushik\nDivya Palat\nZeeshan\nRaju Shrestha\nMangal Dhillon\nDinesh Anand\nShiva\nSuresh Bhagwat \n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nAccording to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 12,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fifteenth highest-selling.All lyrics are written by Nitin Raikwar, Sameer; all music is composed by Anand-Milind\n\nThe music featured in the top 15 best selling albums of 2000..\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChal Mere Bhai on IMDb",

          "Interesting idea. Slope on floor give unusual feel walking round. Seemed like part attraction part art installation. Did seem that full price was quite a lot though especially for a group/family as doesnt take long to look round. Look for deals 2 for 1 etc. Also quite small so",
          "Whilst at the Trafford centre in Manchester, we came across the upside down house and decided to take the kids in. \u00a34.50 each entry is may be too much for potentially a 2 floor 100sqft space to wonder around in for 15 to 20 minutes. (Saturday) As the floor space isn't that",
          "Absolute waste of money, very boring, no interactive or fun element, total rip off. The rooms weren't even divided, there was a bed in the same room as the kitchen. It has been very cheaply done - all furniture is from IKEA value range absolute rubbish don't waste your money",
          "Anyone that says this is a fun attraction must lead a very boring life, its literally 2 rooms one up one down with furniture stuck to the ceiling, no visitor interaction at all, takes about 5 minutes to experience and at \u00a34 each its an absolute rip off \ud83d\udcf4",

          "Bought tickets from wowcher for \u00a33 each had I paid \u00a36 to get in I would have felt cheated. Usual experience but only lasts 10-15 minutes. Wouldn't make a special trip to go.",
          "It was fun but defo overpriced \u00a315 for the 3 of us 20 min of entertainment . New experience but should b half the price",

          "I took my grandson who is 5 here on Saturday. It cost \u00a34.00 to get in to me there is not much in it for the money, the lad was very helpful showing us how and where to take photos. there are only maybe 3 rooms very sloping floors, it was fun but not entertaining enough to stay"

When you buy the ticket to enter you also get to visit the Dino park next to it- doubles the fun for kids. For me I think it\u2019s a one time thing but I do recommend you visit the place at least once.",

          "Should cost 3\u20ac per adult max",

          "Weird and fascinating at the same time",
          "Nice attraction for kids and parents, the only thing I did not like that the cashier did not try to issue family tickets although I told him 2 times. he just wanted to sell them without caring about family dicount. Other wise the place must be visited.",

You have to pay 12 euros for the combined ticket for 2 places (the upside down haus and the butterflies zoo) which is 12 euros per adult. The haus is very nice but the butterflies zoo is ridiculous. It is better no to waste people's money in things they don't want.",

        "wiki": "The Tyrol Panorama Museum or Tirol Panorama (German: Das Tirol Panorama) is a museum in Innsbruck, which is mainly important because it houses the Innsbruck Giant Panorama Painting.\n\n\n== Location and access ==\nThe Tyrol Panorama Museum is at Bergisel in the south of the city. It is accessible on public transport using the IVB lines, Sightseer, Lines 1 and 6, as well as the Stubai Valley Railway and Stubai Valley Bus. A further enhancement is planned in the shape of another bus line for the residents on the Bergisel.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\nThe Giant Panoramic Painting, that was transferred here in September 2010, is the main exhibit of the museum. It depicts the Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809 on 1,000 square metres of canvas.\nAnother focal point of the Tyrol Panorama is the permanent exhibition called the \u201cTyrolean Stage\u201d (\"Schauplatz Tirol\"). Here, the themes of religion, nature, politics and man will be used to explain the \"Tyrolean myth\" by using exhibits. Furthermore, the new house is connected underground to the Kaiserj\u00e4ger Museum, which is a \"museum within the museum\". The exhibition area is visually divided into four thematic areas. \u201cNature\u201d is presented in a 40-metre-long showcase in which, among other things, a cable car gondola and stuffed animals, such as a bear and a beaver, are exhibited. \u201cPolitics\" is located in the middle of the room, where, for example, the horse's head of the so-called \"Aluminum Duce\" monument in Bolzano or the valuable 1511 \u2018\u2019Landlibell\u2019\u2019 of Emperor Maximilian I are found. Interactive \"tree trunks\" show the \"man\" or \"Tyrolean types\". Here you can also find, for example, the pipe of former provincial governor, Eduard Walln\u00f6fer, or a self-portrait of the painter, Anna Stainer-Knittel. The exhibits on \"Religion\" are housed in large glass showcases at the back of the main entrance foyer to the Kaiserj\u00e4ger Museum. Among other things, a baroque pulpit and fresco designs from St. Theresa\u2019s Church by Max Weiler are displayed here.  \nWeiler mural of the \u201cArchduke Ferdinand II and Philippine Welser at Schloss Ambras\u201c was transported to the Tyrol Panorama on 21 February 2011, where it hangs in the restaurant. From 1953 to 2000 the painting was hung in the dining room of the old Hotel Tyrol in Innsbruck. The painting weighs a tonne, is 28 square metres in area and was painted in 24 individual sections.\n\n\n== History and controversies ==\nOn the initiative of the former governor of Tyrol, Herwig van Staa, the museum was originally to be opened in 2009 on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Bergisel. Its construction costs were estimated at six million euros, but this was significantly exceeded, at over 25 million euros. It was opened on 12 March 2011 as part of a large celebration. The opening was attended by 6,500 people. This led to a flash mob initiated by alternative groups to draw attention to the alleged lack of cultural support from the state of Tyrol. The initial reception for the Tyrol Panorama was positive however: 50,000 visitors were received in just the first 2\u00bd months. Many critics of the transfer of the circular painting also changed their opinion and are now convinced by the new location.The relocation of the giant circular painting had already been criticized by the Federal Monuments Office and International Panorama Council as being unjustifiable from the point of view of the protection of the ensemble. The Federal Ministry for Education, Art and Culture, on the other hand, judged the transfer of the giant circular painting into the Tyrol Panorama as a better conservation solution. Some critics have described parts of the exhibition as an arbitrary hotchpotch of exhibits. In addition, the lack of transport connections and  procedures for leasing the attached restaurant were also criticised. On the occasion of a visit on 3 July 2011, Claudia Schmied, Federal Minister of Education, Art and Culture said: \"The giant painting has now found an ideal location.\" She was pleased that \"the large and not uncontroversial project had now come to such a successful conclusion.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nIsabelle Brandauer, u.a.: Das Tirol Panorama, Rund um den Mythos Tirol, Hrsg.

        "wiki": "Innsbruck (German: [\u02c8\u026ansb\u0281\u028ak]; Bavarian: [\u02c8\u026an\u0283pr\u028ak]) is the capital city of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. It is in the Inn valley, at its junction with the Wipp valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass some 30 km (18.6 mi) to the south.\nLocated in the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north, and the Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south. Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name translates as 'Bridge over the River Inn'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps.  It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\nIn 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On February 20, 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\n\n=== Annexation and bombing ===\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\n\n=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) using 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains.\nWinters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual temperature is 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Boroughs and statistical divisions ===\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Z\u00e4hlsprengel).The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\nH\u00f6tting (31.246), consisting of H\u00f6ttinger Au, H\u00f6tting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\nM\u00fchlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Ro\u00dfau\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\nVill (535)\nIgls (2.204)\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\nNordkette\nPatscherkofel\nSerles\n\n\n==== Buildings and monuments ====\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbr\u00fccke)\nAmbras Castle\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\nSt. Anne's Column (Annas\u00e4ule)\nBergisel Ski Jump\nB\u00fcchsenhausen Castle\nCanisianum\nCasino\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\nHungerburgbahn\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\nMaria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen M\u00e4nner)\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\nOld Town (Altstadt)\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nAlpine Club Museum\nAmbras Castle\nArmoury\nCity Archives\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\nKaiserj\u00e4ger Museum\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\n\n==== Churches ====\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\nOld Ursuline Church\nJesuit Church\nChurch of Our Lady\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\nServite Church\nHospital Church\nUrsuline Church\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\nHoly Trinity Church\nSt. John's Church\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\nPradler Parish Church\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\nEvangelical Church of Christ\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\nOld H\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nH\u00f6ttingen Parish Church\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\nParish Church of St. Norbert\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\nParish Church of St. George\nParish Church of St. Paul\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\n\n==== Parks and gardens ====\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\nBaggersee Innsbruck\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\nF\u00fcr Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\nB\u00fcrgerforum Tirol \u2013 Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\nTiroler Seniorenbund \u2013 F\u00fcr Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970.

The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates.\nInnsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations.

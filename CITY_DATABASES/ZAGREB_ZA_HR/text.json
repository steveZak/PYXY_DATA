        "wiki": "Zagreb (; Croatian pronunciation: [z\u01ce\u02d0\u0261reb] (listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level. \nThe estimated population of the city in 2018 was 820,678. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,086,528, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's \u0160\u010ditarjevo. The name \"Zagreb\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf.\nZagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of them are at a low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.\nThe name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum. \nThe older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson.\nAn even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century).\nFor this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D\u00e9csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr\u0119b\u044a which means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatian br\u0207g < Proto-Slavic *berg\u044a, which also means '(smaller) hill', and za br\u0207g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag \u2013 modified from assumed *Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony? \u2013, mentioned above.) An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr\u0119b\u044a is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\"\nbut according to D\u00e9csy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram.\n\nIn Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as  Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri\u010d (Gradec)).\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb  za-grab-, meaning  \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation \nties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka\u017eoti\u0107 (c. 1260\u20131323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.\nIn another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water from Mandu\u0161evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\"Scoop, Manda!\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now \u0160\u0107itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in his honour. During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Zagreb ===\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara\u017edin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara\u017edin and Karlovac general command.\n\n\n=== 19th to mid-20th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first mayor \u2013 Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.\nThe first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\n\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri\u010d cannon is fired daily from the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east and \u010crnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta\u0161a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n=== Modern Zagreb ===\n\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb). \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb-zapad (West\nNovi Zagreb) and Novi Zagreb-istok (East Novi Zagreb)\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.During the 1991\u20131995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many.\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n=== Area and population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), but with significant continental influences and very closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris and London. Autumn in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those districts along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F).The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 \u00b0C (104.7 \u00b0F) in July 1950, and lowest was \u221227.3 \u00b0C (\u221217.1 \u00b0F) in February 1956. A temperature of \u221230.5 \u00b0C (\u221222.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\t\t\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep\u010danka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb \u2013 istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani\u0161te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4\u20138 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani\u0161te or Kajzerica.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n\nThe wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of \u0160\u0107itarjevo.\nPicturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, \u0160estine, Gra\u010dani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, \u0160estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products.\nTo the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament.\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\nThe old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of \u017dumberak-Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,325 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.1 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County. Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia.\nIn 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative centre of both.\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.\n\n\n==== City districts ====\n\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska \u010detvrt, pl. gradske \u010detvrti):\n\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.\n\n\n==== Settlements ====\n\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area \u2013 there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu\u010dko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately. There are 70 settlements in the City of Zagreb administrative area:\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandi\u0107 (BM 365 \u2013Labour and Solidarity Party). He was confirmed as mayor on 4 June 2017 (Zagreb local elections 2017, second round). Two deputy mayors (vice mayoresses) are Jelena Pavi\u010di\u0107-Vuki\u010devi\u0107 and Olivera Jurkovi\u0107-Maji\u0107.\nThe Zagreb Assembly is composed of 51 representatives. Last elections were held on 21 May 2017 (Zagreb local elections). The current structure of the city assembly by party lines is as follows (2 December 2017):\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia, has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county. It is also the seat of the Zagreb County which encircles Zagreb.\nThe city administration bodies are the Zagreb City Assembly (Gradska skup\u0161tina Grada Zagreba) as the representative body and the mayor of Zagreb  (Gradona\u010delnik Grada Zagreba) who is the executive head of the city.\nThe City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d'Hondt method in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them president and vice-presidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives.\nPrior to 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the Zagreb Assembly city deputies have the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. \u2153 of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).\nIn the City of Zagreb the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a \"city with county rights\", there isn't State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).\nCity administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration.\nThe city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly).\nLocal government is organised in 17 city districts (or city borroughs) represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ====\nZagreb is twinned with the following towns and cities:\n\n\n==== Partner cities ====\nThe city has partnership arrangements with:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nZagreb is an important tourist center, not only in terms of passengers traveling from the rest of Europe to the Adriatic Sea, but also as a travel destination itself. Since the end of the war, it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from Austria, Germany and Italy, and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the Republic of Croatia Square, the other at Kamenita vrata, where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called Nine Views. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\nThe historical part of the city to the north of Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square is composed of the Gornji Grad and Kaptol, a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours. The historic district can be reached on foot, starting from Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, the centre of Zagreb, or by a funicular on nearby Tomi\u0107eva Street. Each Saturday, (from April till the end of September), on St. Mark's Square in the Upper town, tourists can meet members of the Order of The Silver Dragon (Red Srebrnog Zmaja), who reenact famous historical conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol. It's a great opportunity for all visitors to take photographs of authentic and fully functional historical replicas of medieval armour.\nIn 2010 more than 600,000 tourists visited the city, with a 10% increase seen in 2011. In 2012 a total of 675 707 tourists visited the city.\nThe record number of tourists visited Zagreb in 2017. \u2013 1.286.087, up 16% compared to the year before, which generated 2.263.758 overnight stays, up 14,8%.\n\n\n==== Souvenirs and gastronomy ====\n\nNumerous shops, boutiques, store houses and shopping centers offer a variety of quality clothing. There are about fourteen big shopping centers in Zagreb. Zagreb's offerings include crystal, china and ceramics, wicker or straw baskets, and top-quality Croatian wines and gastronomic products.\nNotable Zagreb souvenirs are the tie or cravat, an accessory named after Croats who wore characteristic scarves around their necks in the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century and the ball-point pen, a tool developed from the inventions by Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, an inventor and a citizen of Zagreb.\nMany Zagreb restaurants offer various specialties of national and international cuisine. Domestic products which deserve to be tasted include turkey, duck or goose with mlinci (a kind of pasta), \u0161trukli (cottage cheese strudel), sir i vrhnje (cottage cheese with cream), krem\u0161nite (custard slices in flaky pastry), and orehnja\u010da (traditional walnut roll).\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nZagreb's numerous museums reflect the history, art and culture not only of Zagreb and Croatia, but also of Europe and the world. Around thirty collections in museums and galleries comprise more than 3.6 million various exhibits, excluding church and private collections.\nThe Archaeological Museum (19 Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski Square) collections, today consisting of nearly 450,000 varied archaeological artefacts and monuments, have been gathered over the years from many different sources. These holdings include evidence of Croatian presence in the area. The most famous are the Egyptian collection, the Zagreb mummy and bandages with the oldest Etruscan inscription in the world (Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis), as well as the numismatic collection.\nModern Gallery (Croatian: Moderna galerija) holds the most important and comprehensive collection of paintings, sculptures and drawings by 19th- and 20th-century Croatian artists. The collection numbers more than 10,000 works of art, housed since 1934 in the historic Vranyczany Palace in the centre of Zageb, overlooking the Zrinjevac Park. A secondary gallery is the Josip Ra\u010di\u0107 Studio at Margaretska 3.Croatian Natural History Museum (1 Demetrova Street) holds one of the world's most important collection of Neanderthal remains found at one site. These are the remains, stone weapons and tools of prehistoric Krapina man. The holdings of the Croatian Natural History Museum comprise more than 250,000 specimens distributed among various collections.\nTechnical Museum (18 Savska Street) was founded in 1954 and it maintains the oldest preserved machine in the area, dating from 1830, which is still operational. The museum exhibits numerous historic aircraft, cars, machinery and equipment. There are some distinct sections in the museum: the Planetarium, the Apisarium, the Mine (model of mines for coal, iron and non-ferrous metals, about 300 m (980 ft) long), and the Nikola Tesla study.Museum of the City of Zagreb (20 Opati\u010dka Street) was established in 1907 by the Association of the Bra\u0107a Hrvatskog Zmaja. It is located in a restored monumental complex (Popov toranj, the Observatory, Zakmardi Granary) of the former Convent of the Poor Clares, of 1650. The Museum deals with topics from the cultural, artistic, economic and political history of the city spanning from Roman finds to the modern period. The holdings comprise over 80,000 items arranged systematically into collections of artistic and mundane objects characteristic of the city and its history.\nArts and Crafts Museum (10 Republic of Croatia Square) was founded in 1880 with the intention of preserving the works of art and craft against the new predominance of industrial products. With its 160,000 exhibits, the Arts and Crafts Museum is a national-level museum for artistic production and the history of material culture in Croatia.Ethnographic Museum (14 Ivan Ma\u017eurani\u0107 Square) was founded in 1919. It lies in the fine Secession building of the one-time Trades Hall of 1903. The ample holdings of about 80,000 items cover the ethnographic heritage of Croatia, classified in the three cultural zones: the Pannonian, Dinaric and Adriatic.Mimara Museum (5 Roosevelt Square) was founded with a donation from Ante \"Mimara\" Topi\u0107 and opened to the public in 1987. It is located in a late 19th-century neo-Renaissance palace.\nThe holdings comprise 3,750 works of art of various techniques and materials, and different cultures and civilisations.\nCroatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art (works by Croatian primitivists at 3 \u0106irilometodska Street) is one of the first museums of na\u00efve art in the world. The museum holds works of Croatian na\u00efve expression of the 20th century. It is located in the 18th-century Raffay Palace in the Gornji Grad.\nThe museum holdings consist of almost 2000 works of art \u2013 paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints, mainly by Croatians but also by other well-known world artists. From time to time, the museum organises topics and retrospective exhibitions by na\u00efve artists, expert meetings and educational workshops and playrooms.\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art was founded in 1954.

Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe. Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor, INA, Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city.\nThe only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka burza), which is located in Eurotower, one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers.\nAccording to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at $32,185 and $27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of $18,686 and $15,758.As of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna, about \u20ac870 (Croatian average is 5,679 kuna, about \u20ac740). At the end of 2012, the average unemployment rate in Zagreb was around 9.5%.\n34% of companies in Croatia have headquarters in Zagreb, and 38.4% of the Croatian workforce works in Zagreb, including almost all banks, utility and public transport companies.Companies in Zagreb create 52% of total turnover and 60% of total profit of Croatia in 2006 as well as 35% of Croatian export and 57% of Croatian import.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Highways ====\n\nZagreb is the hub of five major Croatian highways.\nThe highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, and forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu\u010dko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.\nA3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa. It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe. Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori\u010dan border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Vara\u017edin \u2013 \u010cakovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes. The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu\u0161kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai\u0107 Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east\u2013west arteries, former Highway \"Brotherhood and Unity\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba\u010dka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.\n\n\n===== Bridges =====\nZagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are:\n\nThere are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi\u010devec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre\u0161i\u0107 (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east).\nTwo additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nPublic transportation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail.\nThe public transportation company ZET (Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\nThe national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice, H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.\nThe funicular (uspinja\u010da) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction.\nTaxi market has been liberalized in early 2018 and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n\n===== Tram network =====\n\nZagreb has an extensive tram network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30\u201350 kilometres per hour (19\u201331 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon\u010dar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T\u017dV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \"TMK 2200\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.\n\n\n===== Suburban rail network =====\n\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east\u2013west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor\u010dek was closed in the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Air traffic ====\n\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft. The airport had 2,77 millions of passengers in 2016 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers.\nZagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu\u010dko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu\u010dko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.A third, small grass airfield, Bu\u0161evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nZagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia. There are 5 public higher education institution and 9 private professional higher education schools.\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nFounded in 1669, the University of Zagreb is the oldest continuously operating university in Croatia and one of the largest and oldest universities in the Southeastern Europe. Ever since its foundation, the university has been continually growing and developing and now consists of 29 faculties, three art academies and the Croatian Studies Centre. More than 200,000 students have attained the Bachelor's degree at the university, which has also assigned 18,000 Master's and 8,000 Doctor's degrees.\nAs of 2011, the University of Zagreb is ranked among 500 Best Universities of the world by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities.\nZagreb is also the seat of two private universities: the Catholic University of Croatia and the Libertas International University; as well as numerous public and private polytechnics, colleges and higher professional schools.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nZagreb \u2013 Official website\nZagreb Tourist Board\nVisit Zagreb - Travel Guide\nZagreb Fair\nZagreb International airport",

          "It's just a normal Cathedral in the city. There is nothing special about it. I've seen many similar Cathedrals in Europe. But it's OK to visit it while in Zagreb.",
          "One of the most Beautifull buildings in town (do under construction) the buildings surrounding the Cathedral all tel a story. The Cathedral is open for visiting.",
          "I visited during a pleasant Saturday morning walk. The cathedral is an impressive edifice and is undergoing extensive renovation. To the left of the main entrance is an interesting side-by-side comparison of an old, weathered stone carving and its modern replacement. Nearby",
          "Small cathedral which is still under construction on one of the two towers. Entry is free and dress accordingly, not too much skin on display! Internally the cathedral is typically finished, nothing remarkable but still very nice.",

          "This is one of Zagreb's major landmarks. Entrance is free. I'm very glad I went with a guide as there is no information in English. There is a panel of writing in the Glagolitic script, the first Slavic script, which was (probably unsurprisingly) mostly developed to help spread",

          "This cathedral is well worth a look outside where it and its golden statue out the front are quite imposing. Inside it is fascinating as well.",
          "As cathedrals go in Europe, I don't think it's anything especially special, but still well worth popping in for a visit if you're walking around Zagreb. The best parts for me were the stained glass windows (the summer sun creates a stunning glow inside) and a large Glagolitic",
          "Stunning inside and out. Regardless of religion, you can\u2019t help be impressed and inspired by this place. Children do need to be quiet and modest dress is needed.",
          "A stunning building, inside and out. It\u2019s one of those places that are a wow when you first see the spires. The stained glass windows are particularly striking. There is no information inside in English but that doesn\u2019t really detract from a visit. Free to enter and of course,",
          "Very cool! Free admission and such a nice building and grounds inside and out! Lots to read inside as well. Please be respectful of the people praying as some people were being really loud when people were trying to pray. The area was under renovation and it was neat they even",

          "Very nice and big church. Better ones i saw only in Paris and Bruxsell. The only problem was that I could not enjoy the whole picture as it's under renovation. It worth to get inside and have a look at the windows. Impressive. Since it's in the center, you should not miss it out.",

          "A beautiful cathedral next to the old city wall. Will probably go back on a different day (not Sunday) to take more pictures inside. It felt disrespectful to take many photos on a Sunday straight after the service as many people were still praying.",

          "For some reason, church's seem to be the one of the highlight of our trip, and this was a good one. Outside is under some renovation, inside is huge. Funny story on the chandeliers, they recently came from a casino in Las Vegas. Apparently the locals were not too happy.",

          "Interesting Cathedral in gothic style, representing an important part of the Croatian history. The interior is not flashy, but it has to be seen if you are in Zagreb. One tower is being renovated, apparently since long time.",
          "A symbol of Zagreb. A Beautiful cathedral with very interesting architecture. Built in the Roman Gothic style with so many details. A History of the cathedral takes back to the 9th century and at first when you see it you'll get very good impression and it won't change not even",
          "Does God really care if those who visit and want to worship are wearing shorts? I certainly don\u2019t think so. Yet there was a sour faced gatekeeper whose, it seemed, sole purpose on earth was to make certain that no one, and I do mean no one(!), darkened the door wearing shorts. I",
          "The town of the museums. Yes, the speech is about the Zagreb town, but don\u00b4t forget this town it's not just about museums. You can also find here probably the most popular and the biggest the cultural-historical monument, Zagreb Cathedral. This cathedral was builidng in the",

          "Beautiful on the outside and inside. Be sure to enjoy the guilt chandeliers from Las Vegas casino. They really look great in their new home. The fascist sympathising and cannonised archbisop (?) who dominates the alter is another issue altogether. This is another example of",

          "Gothic style , very beautiful inside and outside with beautiful stained glass. Very well preserved , a must see .",

          "This is one of the two amazing church's in Zagreb, St Mark's for its uniqueness and the Cathedral for its grand beauty. The architecture inside and out is just amazing to look at and out of all of the Cathedrals I have visited on my trip it has been the only free one.",

          "I visited here during Zagreb Advent 2017. The whole city is transformed into fairytale white wonderland. Inside the cathedral itself is like any other roman catholic church you see in Europe. If you like roman churches then this is for you, if you haven't been inside one before",
          "In a prominent position overlooking the city the cathedral towers above the city. It\u2019s location is easy to get to walking from the central square and close to the fruit market. In winter the interior is heated so very comfortable and the advent displays inside make it a",

          "The cathedral is a must when you\u2019re in Zagreb especially because it\u2019s in the city centre. In the winter time during Advent it\u2019s even prettier with all the lights surrounding it. Inside it\u2019s huge a you can see some of the greatest saints.",
          "It's really quite nice Churchill have seen so far. Somehow, the priest was there who asked me where are you from and when I said that I am from India he was very happy. And start talking in hindi,that was really amazing to see as he knows 18 languages. His name is st.lukas and",
          "This is our (ie Zagreb citizen's) cathedral, or as we call it \"katedrala\". If you are a Roman Catholic, yes, you should definitely go inside to get some inner peace. It is tall and spacious from the inside, and quite big compared to many other Croatian churches, and has lots of",

          "Of course you will go here. Who needs a review? No one. You will go here, you will wander around a bit, you will enjoy yourself, you will wander off and find something cool like the Tolkien House (which is a neat little bar with super beer).",
          "The outside and inside is amazing. It dominates Kaptol Square as it soars over the city. It was badly damaged during an 1880 earthquake. I really like how they have covered the work on one of the towers by surrounding it by a \"photograph\" of what it looks like underneath.",

          "This Cathedral is situated about 100m off the main square. Entry is free and worth a visit. I suggest I walking guide as everything is in Croatian. I also suggest visiting after dark, so pretty at night, lite up well",
          "This cathedral is a landmark of Zagreb, and we could see it from almost everywhere in the city. Its fa\u00e7ade was very beautiful and impressive despite one of the towers under repair. The interior was stunning, especially the stained glasses, the baroque decorative altar, and",
          "The cathedral is stunning inside and out even though one of its towers in under renovation (apparently forever). Some of the interior dates back to the 13th century, the rest is a bit of all kinds of styles. There's lots of lovely marble work everywhere. It's lovely.",

          "The cathedral is probably the main symbol of Zagreb's skyline. A must visit in my point of view. Voluntary donations are welcome, but not compulsory. Looks like they have been renovating the cathedral as it is in very good shape with only the right steeple still surrounded by",

          "I found the cathedral interesting mainly in that it was NOT as baroque as many churches that had at any time been under the Hapsburg Catholic monarchy. There was a wall inscription in angular glagolitic and imo a rather macabre entombment in the apse... but a part of the appeal",
          "This cathedral, formerly known as St Stephen\u2019s, (like those in Vienna and Budapest) is the most interesting architectural realization of the church architecture in this region. Formerly built in Romanesque style, later completely reconstructed in neo-Gothic stile, the church is",

          "A beautiful gothic cathedral with plenty of drama on the outside. Inside is more traditional but with a fun fact - the 3 huge chandeliers used to hang in a casino in Las Vegas. Wouldn't think about it unless you knew, but once you know it it's a little funny to think about and",
          "A truly lovely architectural wonder in Zagreb. A visit inside yielded even more wonder and appreciation for this beautiful church. We stayed for a bit in the pew and had time for prayer and reflection. Having visited many cathedrals and churches in Europe this was special and",

          "Generally, cathedrals are awesome places to visit with their high ceilings and ornate surroundings. This one will not dissapoint. Great place to have a solemn moment.",
          "We visited Cathedral of the Assumption on a very special Catholic day, and many religious were in presence. Did enter the Cathedral of the Assumption during a \"break\" time.",
          "A really lovely inside..............gorgeous pulpit and organ and stained glass.......and right next to the main market and main square......worth the trip for sure (and marvelous clean, free toilets just to the left!!!)",
          "Visit this important monument, full of devotion, and participate in sunday masses. Very good choir. Nice surroundings",
          "I think it's a beautiful cathedral above all by night, at the internal not very beautiful. It's located near to Zagreb's principal square.",
          "We adjusted our day to see the treasury early before our next activity but it was no longer open. The cathedral has scaffolding for repairs on one spire so, while it is necessary, it obscures your view. Interior is quite nice with a wonderful story about the chandeliers coming",
          "It was a nice chapel and free (so worth a visit). Inside the cathedral was rather poorly lit but pretty. Have seen more beautiful and impressive cathedrals but this is still worth seeing.",
          "Restored classic cathedra. Service was in Croatian but the music was wonderful. Restoration is ongoing but the cathedral was fully functional",
          "The cathedral was undergoing restoration on its facade. Nonetheless it was very beautiful. The facade is almost completely restored and it looks great. The interior is also fantastic , especially the stained glass.",
          "The structure is imposing and comes into view after a short climb from the center square. Did not go inside due to the renovations but wandered into the interesting side alleyway housing the convent.",
          "The cathedral has been extensively restored as it has been damaged many times over the years. This is why the stonework looks new. Nevertheless it is a beautiful building and is still the tallest structure in Zagreb. Some of the original stonework can be seen outside, as well as",
          "A really beautiful cathedral with breath taking stained glass. Free to visit and seemingly open all hours - unlike almost every other church in Zagreb - this is a must see whether you come on your own or a guide brings you. Bit of renovation going on in May 2017, but nothing to",
          "This is a must see if you are in the city as it's very close to where it's all happening. It's a beautiful building & admission is free. The inside is also very impressive. They do like arms & legs to be kept covered, so a warning if you are planning to turn up in shorts &",
          "This is a beautiful Cathedral. We went to mass on a Sunday at 10am and the bishop celebrated it. They had a choir of around 80 people it was beautiful and solemn.",
          "This cathedral is in the old part of town and a short walk from downtown Zagreb. Repair works are going on. Looks impressive from the outside and also inside. But to an untrained eye like mine, most Cathedrals look the same. You will pass by this cathedral on the way to the old",
          "You would find cathedrals all over Europe but this is also beautiful architecture. I think it was better than Bazilika Budapest coz older. The details of the ceiling was marvelous/ manifique.",
          "The Neo-Gothic cathedral is famous as one of the landmarks of Zagreb. The renovation seems to take forever. The statue of the Virgin Mary with Angels is in front of the church. The defensive walls with towers are a rare example of defence against the Ottomans in the 16th",
          "Our guide said this is the tallest building in Croatia. The Gothic architecture is beautiful and contains the sarcophagus of a Catholic cardinal who helped Jews and others escape during WWII. Sit quietly on the inside of the cathedral to fully experience its beauty.",
          "Nice cathedral with interesting history (as you can read on the desks on the left side of the cathedral entrance - by the fence entering the historical site). You can sneak-peak inside for free.",
          "Very impressive cathedral. Even though the outside has been under construction (\"forever\", say the locals) the inside is beautiful - both the floor and the ceiling as well as the rest of the church. Free to enter. Also unique in that you can walk around pretty much all of the",
          "It is immense and beautiful. The details in the sculptures and altars of the Church are incredible and actually mind-blowingly brilliant. It dwarfs you as you stand in front of it and humbles you as you enter.",
          "I was in Zagreb during Easter, so the cathedral was rather busy. It was possible to go inside and it was very nice to look at. There were a lot of people praying and waiting in line for confession, so I didn't take any pictures. The cathedral is also very impressive from the",
          "The Cathedral of the Assumption is one of the most beautiful cathedrals I have ever visited. It is also one of the most fragile. Constructed of sandstone it is constantly being renovated/restored. The area surrounding the cathedral is also beautiful with fountains and lots of",
          "This was one of our stops on the Segway tour. We had been here before but the guide gave some great insight. Like the earthquake that stopped the clock. The original limestone collapsing. It is a beautiful cathedral.",
          "Impressive cathedral. Centre of town. Just off main square. No entry fee. Check out the old clock on the old town wall, just to the left of the cathedral. It stopped during the earthquake of 1880. Worth a visit. Very peaceful.",
          "Gorgeous cathedral, day or night, just off the Dolac Market and a short walk from the Josip Jelacic Square.",
          "This is the main church in the city of Zagreb and the main town square. There is much beauty inside, and two different spires make the architecture interesting to see. This is the tallest building in the city.",
          "A unique cathedral with twin towers, it was a pity one of them was under maintenance when I was there, with nettings and hoardings outside. It didn't look good on pictures, but then again, I shouldn't grumble; buildings do need maintenance and repair. The interior of the",
          "The tallest building in the city that is used as a landmark as to where you are. Nice nice stained glass inside but otherwise very similar to other Catholic churches.",
          "This is a nice cathedral in Zagreb. It has a beautifully designed exterior, although the inside is basically just OK. My favourite part was the Easter egg display outside. This is close to downtown and easy to get to. Worth a visit.",
          "The building is a nice impressive design. We especially liked the large Easter eggs outside the building. Inside also impresses, Well worth a visit.",
          "Attend to the holy service on Sundays at 11.30. You will get a good impression of the Croatian urban Catholics. If you get the chance to listen to a concert, do not miss it.",
          "This is known landmark of the city. Building is huge. Two towers dominate and are nearly always in reconstruction or reparation, at least part of one. Interior is less interesting than expected. Furnishing, altars, colored windows are from different periods, mainly from 19. or",
          "Beautiful old cathedral on the outside and the inside. It is too bad that we saw it when one of the towers was in construction.",
          "The Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, Zagreb is a beautiful place with awesome stainglass, frescos etc. It is an easy to identify landmark in Old Town part of Zagreb.",
          "The Cathedral has suffered mishap over the years but has been restored. Firstly it was destroyed by invaders in about the 14th century and then it was partly destroyed by an earthquake. The clock face showing the time of the earthquake is on display just outside the Cathedral.",
          "Don't miss this lovely gem. Very nice area and another spectacular church. Loved seeing the turrets next to it too .",
          "Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Zagreb is must-visit. Beautiful, amazing and stunning architecture.",
          "Generally I'm not one for visiting churches, museums or art galleries, but I'm so glad I went inside this beautiful building. It covers all three in one. Highly recommend as it is such an interesting place and very inspiring.",
          "This cathedral is Roman Catholic, and the Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary. It is the tallest building in Croatia and its two spires at 108 metres make a wonderful landmark over the city. It was severely damaged in an earthquake in 1880 and mostly rebuilt in gothic revival",
          "Though the present structure dates to the great earthquake of 1880, the church existed as early as the 11th century. The stunning neo-Gothic fa\u00e7ade includes a rose window, a heavily carved doorway, and twin spires; and the exterior is undergoing extensive restoration. They are",
          "Nice place to visit on your own, or with a guide that can tell you more about its history. Very nice architecture",
          "The cathedral shows how much these people suffered in the near past. very centrally located it was a short walk from the Esplanade hotel.",

          "I stumbled upon the cathedral on my stroll this morning and went in for a peek! It was cool to be able to walk around the entire building and the stained glass windows were so incredibly stunning.",
          "A beautiful cathedral that warrants a visit while in Zagreb. The Gothic-style architecture was both incredibly beautiful and hauntingly melancholic; an interesting juxtaposition if you ask me. But that's what makes it worth seeing!",
          "Absolutely stunning cathedral, lots of history attached to it, which is documented on the wall in different languages",
          "I think I can say we were suitably impressed with our visit to the Cathedral. I have 68 pictures from 30 minutes inside. There are so many detailed items to be seen, the huge paintings seem as fresh looking as if new. The statuary around the altar area are near perfection. Very",
          "Beautiful cathedral, open to the public. The outside is being partially renovated at the moment, but it's more impressive from the inside anyway.",
          "Great architecture. We always visiting churches. In every city we are there will be at least one church.This one was very special.",
          "Beautiful architecture and amazing ambience. As part of a Zagreb Cultural Experience this building has to be visited. It's open to the public and photography is allowed. Bang in the centre of the city it is easily accessed",
          "Its under construction, and its very dark inside.The staff assigned to the cathedral were unconcerned about assisting customers.",
          "Came here on Dec-30 and was lucky enough to still seeing Christmas settings around. There's a big Christmas tree next to the magnificent golden status of Mother Mary, and a stable that resembles Bethlehem next to it. I guess there was probably some kind of performance in the",
          "Impressive but seems to have continuous renovation on towers. The place is so friendly that even usually unhappy nuns are smiling to you in the Cathedral of the Assumption in Zagreb. Go there!",
          "In the Kaptol, very beautiful religious and cultural place. It was open most of the time during Christmas. Admission is free. Really one of the top attractions in Zagreb. A must see.",

          "The Zagreb Cathedral on Kaptol is a Roman Catholic institution and not only the tallest building in Croatia, but also the most monumental sacral building in Gothic style southeast of the Alps.It is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and to kings Saint Stephen and Saint",
          "The Cathedral of the Assumption is beautiful from the outside and inside and most definitely worth a visit. We went late morning on a Sunday so it was heaving inside as a service was about to commence, but we still managed to take a leisurely stroll around and take in all the",
          "one of the must see places in zagreb for its arhitecture reminds of old and well frgoten times world lived in",
          "The cathedral is very dramatic and very atmospheric. At Christmas, there is a life crib being enacted outside the church yard.",
          "The Cathedral is a must to visit when you are in Zagreb. Very impresive from the outside and inside. The whole area around it is just beautiful.",
          "Beautiful inside and out, place was almost empty when we walked through. The architecture and art and statuary are really impressive. This is also close to the market and near town center.",
          "Visited this cathedral on a sunny day in December! Does get very busy inside and out but not too bad! The sun was shining through the stain glass windows and it looked so pretty! Beautiful inside just wonder round and you won't be disappointed:)",

          "The original cathedral was destroyed in 1879 by an earthquake. The present one was rebuilt by the architect Bollet from 1880 to 1905. Beside the 3 chandeliers offered by an american from Las Vegas (the chandeliers come from a casino). everything else is from the reconstruction",
          "Magnificent architecture. Very spacious and beautifully fitted interior. The cathedral is well worthy of a visit.",
          "Speechless. The Church is enormous, the architecture is just amazing. It has six chapels inside and a shrine.Definitely worth going.",
          "If you'll ask anyone for the directions or anything that's got to do with this church, just say \"the cathedral\". In Zagreb, noone uses its full name (I didn't even know this is the full name until I've seen it here). The thing you'll probably be disappointed about are constant",
          "This is a very nice cathedral just up from the main square. It is beautiful inside and very peaceful to go and sit and reflect.",
          "In spite of the constant restoration works, the cathedral is a stunning building from the outside as well as in its interior. The story of its chandeliers is quite quirky.",
          "We attended 9am mass on 6 Nov (Sun). When we first saw the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we were awed by it. The architecture is very detailed & elaborated. Though the church is 923-years old, much have been restored for the past centuries, especially",
          "A place that you must visit if you are coming to Zagreb. You will see it from different parts of the town.",
          "The men's choir that sang at a Sunday service sounded excellent, and spread around the church were inspirational scenes from the bible and statues of saints. Passionate worshippers add to the aura of this gothic style cathedral. Highlights: behind the altar is a shrine of sorts",
          "It's much larger inside than it looks from the outside. There's a great organ on a balcony at the back which was being played when we visited - a real bonus. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any information about it, or when there might be concerts. The tomb of the founding",
          "Not everyone likes yet another church. This one is clean, not surrounded by beggars and has some interesting features inside, like some fine statues, tombs and windows. Although a good example of Catholic stylistic exaggeration it is one of the more attractive cathedrals.",
          "This is an imposing structure . As with many places in Croatia there is a long and changing history . Windows , pillars , organ , statues and much more .Many side alters etc . . An inspiring place . Definitely get a guide to explain the history and stories",
          "What an amazing cathedral! We arrived at night but there was a service going on inside. Wish we could have explored more. The outside was being renovated.",
          "This Cathedral is impressive both from the outside as well as within. Well worth a visit. Renovation works are ongoing.",
          "Central cathedral just up from the main square. Beautiful inside. This is the main cathedral in Zagreb",
          "Try and get a guide for the cathedral as you would miss so much doing it on your own. Even if you are a none believe you can certainly appreciate the beauty of the place.",
          "Its free of charge as any church on this planet should be. Nobody should have to stay outside, because of money. The cathedral itself is nice. Go there while your stay in Zagreb. You can take photos in and outside as well as skyline shoots from Zagreb 360 eye.",
          "This is at the upper town of Zagreb and is a must visit. Entry is free and one should check on the Mass timings so as to avoid visiting during prayers hours, The grandoise of the entrance is only enhanced on entering the cathedral. One can appreciate the exterior's neo-gothic",

          "Our guide took us through so this was interesting history. You can go up on the altar. There is a WC next door on the left as you face it.",
          "Great and beautiful landmark still being partially renovated on the outside. It houses the tomb of Blessed Aloysius Stepinac.",
          "It is a bit dark inside but it is worth to see this sacred place. No photos during Holy Mass service. Entrance is free.",

          "The kathedral is beautiful but we also really learnt a lot by visiting the nearby exhibition on Cardinal Stepanic. The curator was very informative. Well worth visiting.",
          "It's puzzling that so few TA reviewers have failed to mention the cathedral's beautiful Renaissance walls. These walls are among the best-preserved Renaissance defences in Europe. They were built between 1512 and 1521 as a potential defence against the Ottoman Turks. These",
          "The towers are undergoing a facelift, to replace the worn out limestone with better materials. Nevertheless, the Cathedral interior is wonderfully rich in architecture and design. Don't forget to go the front where the tomb of Cardinal Stepanic is laid.",
          "If you are into cathedrals this is worth visiting, but in my opinion this is just like any other cathedral",
          "The cathedral is huge and beautiful outside as well as inside. Definitely not to be missed. It's just too bad that some people still go in with short pants...",
          "Really stunning inside, very intricate details and pretty windows. I'd try and go early to avoid the crowds and tourist tours",
          "The cathedral is undergoing some major refurbishment to the second of its two spires and will be spectacular when it's eventually finished It's an imposing church on one of the high points in Zagreb and well worth a visit There are more ornate churches thru Europe but each has",

          "the cathedral is really impressive and beautiful, both inside and outside, very popular for tourists but also local people",
          "Zagreb is the capital city of Croatia. Not surprisingly, it has its share of impressive buildings, both old, historical ones as well as modern malls. Most visitors will probably make a beeline for the Cathedral as well as the distinctive St. Mark\u2019s Church but if you have the",
          "Magnificent construction and it is great to see the restoration in progress. Gorgeous stained glass windows. On Sunday there were locals in traditional dress singing dancing and entertaining visitors.",

          "Our hotel receptionist recommend I visit here and I wasn't disappointed. It had quite a few visitors when I arrived but was still very quiet and peaceful. I found it a lovely place to reflect for a few moments. Lots of nice artwork and sculpture.",
          "I didn't expect this beautiful cathedral in Zagreb, but here it is. Really tall and it was great to feel it.",
          "Being situated on a hill called Kaptol, and over a 100m (103m, to be exact) tall, it can be see from all over Zagreb, as an orientation point, and a symbol of Zagreb. Its furthest part (around the altar), is the oldest, and built in Gothical style throughout the Middle Ages.",

          "This was amazing! As a catholic from England it was amazing to see a really OLD cathedral that remains Catholic! The outside is super ornate with two cathedral spires in neo gothic style. The flood is mozaic glazed tiles and there is an abundance of stained glass windows which",
          "A truly remarkable building. The architecture amazes. The attention to detail on the outside and inside never cease to amaze. The building does however look like most Cathedrals you'll see in Europe.",
          "When we visited one of the towers was being renovated. However the front was still beautiful. Walking around the building you'll see the renovation process still has a long way to go. The inside is nice, it is a rather dark church inside. But that also makes it special.",
          "This church has a lovely location in upper town on a small square with a statue of Mary. is very interesting both inside and out.",

          "Our family of 5 visited Zagreb in July 2016. The cathedral is pretty hard to miss. You will see it as you enter the Upper Town and it is certainly a part of every walking tour. We briefly went inside and from what we could see, it is quite lovely. The exterior itself warrants a",

          "A stunning gothic style cathedral. We were fascinated to learn about the restoration works going on here as a result of acid rain.",
          "A really pretty example of a cathedral. Obviously, don't wear shorts or hats; they're not overly keen on it in Zagreb. It's a solid hour of looking about - but you can easily make this a 90min exploration if you're as interested in the history, statues and writings all over the",

          "I have seen a few cathedrals, and this one is in no way the biggest, nor the most decorated one. It is however, the only one i have seen with an external wall, and that alone is worth the visit. Inside it is large, awe-inspiring and overall a lovely piece of architecture. It's",

          "Scaffolding was up when we visited but it was lovely to see they had imposed a picture of the cathedral on the scaffolding to make it look the same! Impressed. Unfortunately couldn't go in the cathedral itself as there is a strict clothing rule of no short shorts and/or vest",
          "As the cathedral is in a constant state of repair a Croatian business man bought and donated the large candelabra to the cathedral having bought them from a soon to be demolished casino in Las Vegas. They were supposed to be temporary but remain to this day. Worth a walk around",
          "This cathedral is a must see when visiting Zagreb. Beautiful place and great history. A very short walk from the center square of Zagreb.",
          "very nice area to stroll around. THe courtyard of the Cathedral is picturesque and tranquil. You can tell from the color of the stone of the church to see which part is built after the damage.",
          "The exterior is currently partly covered with scaffolding on one spire, but don't let that spoil your enjoyment. This church dominates the skyline on the top of the hill. Make sure you spend time admiring the outside & its setting before being wowed by the internal decoration.",

          "This is an icon in Zagreb and the dominant feature of the skyline. You must see the structure from every angle outside or you will miss many details. Try to attend mass or visit when the pipe organ is in use. It has a spectacular sound and is one of the best I have heard.",
          "Nice to gaze at but didn't go in Most of it was a giant picture stuck to the scaffolding Would like to see it without the scaffolding",

          "I find it interesting to visit various churches and this one was large and impressive. Do note that appropriate dress is required, no shorts. They are still working on the renovation to the outside. Worth a look but not significantly different from others of the time period.",
          "When I visited this great cathedral and went in I could really see how huge it is. The Zagreb Cathedral on Kaptol is a Roman Catholic institution and not only the tallest building in Croatia, but also the most monumental sacral building in Gothic style southeast of the Alps. It",

          "A small botanical garden in the city center, near the train station and ten minutes walk from the main square. A great place to spend an hour in peace. Due to the size of the limited number of plants, but you can find beauty in any season except the winter when it is closed.",
          "And not much else. My experience of Botanical gardens ( and, slightly biased,we have a fabulous one here in Glasgow) is that there is a large variety of items including flowers and other gardeny stuff. Not here. Trees. If that is your thing- you will love it, because that is",
          "This garden is situated in the centre of the city, close to the railway station. Very accesible for everyone. Closes at night. Trees and plants have signs indicating the name of the tree/plant.",
          "I would come back on Spring or Summer but I would not return in Oct. Everything has run its course and the plants were tired. I can see earlier in the year that it would be worth your time but not in Oct.",
          "Had a look from the outside but each day we just missed being able to explore because of the early closing time. It looked very interesting though.",
          "This is a self guided botanical garden-though I believe you can arrange a guided tour. We enjoyed strolling through the place. While a visit at the end of September didn't offer much in terms of variety of flowering plants there were still plenty of interesting plants and trees",
          "There is nothing special in this garden. You will only see some kind of trees from different countries. It is too small.",
          "The botanical garden was a really nice experience and very calming. I visited the botanical garden and a very hot day and just relaxed and take in the lovely scenery. This botanical garden have a lot of potential to be a much better garden if it was more maintained. All in all I",
          "These gardens are near the railway station. They are not very big but hold a variety of well labeled plants Many signs are in both Croatian and English. Traffic and railway noise are a distraction.",
          "We were a bit disappointed by this garden. There were, early September, a lot of work going on and it is not very big. Not quiet as close to big roads. It is worth visiting if you are close by and it is open (closed some afternoon, best to check). Free entrance.",
          "Its a relatively small botanical garden which contains many different plants species from many continents. Nice shady alleyways to sit down and enjoy the peace and quiet from the city's bustle. It has an educational centre, a pond with turtles and a greenhouse dome. The garden",
          "These lovely Botanical gardens are well worth a visit. The area is not too big, so fairly easy to walk around the various plots. The plants are well labelled with information. The lake and bridge are really pretty. There is also another area with an amazing selection of water",

          "The Botanical gardens was located just a couple of mins from our hotel (Esplanade) so we decided to visit at 4pm on a sunny afternoon. The walks around the gardens are lovely and clearly signposted. Lovely photo oppotunities - bridge over a pond, gazebo etc. Very well maintained",
          "This is a well maintained and organized spot to spend a leisurely half-day or more in Zagreb. The plants are labeled as one would expect and all were well maintained and watered. My visit was on a Sunday morning and there was no entry fee, which I expect is true for the other",

          "I went to the Botanical Gardens as part of walking the Lenuci Horseshoe. Although it's small, it has over 5,000 species of plants. There are plenty of seats available so you can pause as you walk to soak it all in. I lived the little bridge over the pond. It was a lovely spot. I",
          "This is really not on the tourist trail, but if you have the time, do visit this verdant garden in the heart of the city. After the monuments and markets, it's a refreshing change. Stroll between the old trees and creepers visit the rather quaint greenhouses, acquaint yourself",

          "This beautiful Botanical garden is located in the heart of the down town of Zagreb. It was not very far from where we stayed. Like all botanical gardens it has a number of species but noteworthy is, it has a fairly good collection of exotic plants. The green houses are old but",
          "There lots of flowers still in bloom like the roses etc. The greenhouses were closed for repair. As well as the gift shop and garden office. You can book a tour in advance. It is for a minumum of 10 people and cost 300 K . Most of the plants are labled.",

          "I arrived there about 9:10 a.m. so I had the garden to myself for about 30 minutes. Walking around the garden slowly, I took many pictures of the plants, gazebo, rock gardens, trees, etc. My favorite one is the pond that has huge water lilies and other water plants. There are",
          "The garden is pleasantly laid out, well maintained, very well labelled and a relaxing place to walk around. I am more interested in trees than smaller plants and was hoping for a larger variety of tree types, hence the 4 stars rather than 5. Admission is free but they closed at",
          "While not the most impressive botanical garden in the world, the Zagreb gardens are a lovely and fun place to walk around and spend some time in peace. It is free and close to the center of town. It also has many fun things for kids like basic exhibits, a pond with turtles, and",
          "we were only here for 36 hours and as tourist you tend to cram everything in. From what we saw it demands more time to appreciate it regrettably we did not have that time",
          "We went there and strolled the grounds and there was one area of exotic flowers that were beautiful. It was near the structure in the above picture. Inside this structure were the largest water lilies I have ever seen! It was a lovely quick diversion.",
          "We visited the Botanical Garden at high noon on a blazingly hot day, which resulted in us spending less time here than we would have liked. There are extensive stands of very mature trees, so there was plenty of shade, but the temperature was mid-30's C. Despite the heat, the",
          "Yes, they even have a dear little Wollemi pine tree from Australia just as you walk in! So as an Aussie I have to like this place. It is small but what they do have are some very interesting planting\u2019s and trees, especially this one! Great place for a quiet picnic lunch and",
          "The gardens are located right in the city and provide a quiet place for visitors. I would have loved to see more blooming flowers, but the many plants are lush and interesting. The pond and bridge were my favorite part of the gardens.",
          "The gardens are located a 10 minute walk from the main street and run near the Railway line. Lovely and cool there in the summer. Worth a stroll through to see the trees and different flowers.",
          "I visited twice during my week in Zagreb. The first time was on a public holiday, when almost everything was closed. It was pouring that day yet there were several other visitors. I returned on a nicer day and it was quite crowded. The day I returned I discovered the several",
          "Had a relaxed group walk with my friends. The guide was very nice, he took time to explain and answer our questions. They have quite a good variety and interesting species. We were satisfied, the time spent were worth it.",
          "I might have missed this but it was right down the street from my hotel. There is no cost to enter and it is very nice to wander around in for an hour or so. It was raining a little the day I was there so it probably would have been even nicer if it was sunny. Definitely",
          "A very nice space right in the center of the city. It is worth visiting the space that is very well arranged, with all different species well identified. I recommend it.",
          "Nice, small garden, part of on u shape green zone in the city made up or of more parks. The garden is not very big but it's a good way to pass some time.",
          "Within a block of the Hotel Esplanade Zagreb is the botanical garden. Several acres are devoted to many natural plantings include several groves of trees, all of which are labelled. We found it to be an excellent place for an early am walk to view birds and butterflies in",
          "The botanical garden is not very large but very well maintained. It was a nice stroll and great way to take the time to \"smell the roses\". We arrived early morning, best time there were few visitors.",
          "While en route to another destination entirely we found ourselves walking right by the botanical garden. We looped back to the entrance and upon discovering there was no admission charge we thought, what the heck. The fact that everything was identified, in English, was very",
          "As a botanical enthusiast, I was disappointed by the poor standard of maintenance in this garden. The trees themselves are quite lovely & I was impressed to see the famous Wollemi Pine, but the glasshouses marked on the map as \u201cExhibition glasshouses\u201d are in complete ruins.",
          "A cool break from the heat, but as gardens go it's very average. Not particularly attractive and not particularly well kept. Don't make a special trip to visit it.",
          "Beautiful trees to provide shade while walking through the gardens. A couple of small lakes with a bridge and seasonal flowers. Most everything is labeled. Numerous benches to sit on to relax and people watch. Can spend as much time as you want but can make it all around",
          "Always visited Zagreb and I wanted to enter a visit. But I didn\u2019t have time. I glad I did. The garden is not that big. But is big enough to have a great time. You can enjoy some nice green areas and enjoy different flowers and trees. If you suffer from polen allergies avoid",
          "Not only nature-conscious people appreciate this oasis of greenery in the middle of the city. Everyone wishing to go for a nice walk and learn something along the path(s) should visit it. This Botanical Garden is not huge, which definitely is to its advantage. An hour+ walk",
          "As entry is free, the kiosk provides free visitor's guides without charge. Unusual to see a university garden laid out with visitors in mind. Cafe kiosk would be a useful addition. Expect to see helpful information boards rather than a wall of Latin names pinned to plants.",
          "Central and free. Fairly small but at least give it an hour. Find the \"Monet\"style Chinese bridge over a small lake and spot the turtles. Afterwards drop into the Esplanade Hotel for a drink and check out the Art Deco decor. It's practically nextdoor.",
          "We loved this place. Absolutely beautiful. It was a nice day so we had a great time walking around and enjoying the beauty.",
          "Its a nice place to chill and have a quiet walk round. I think come May it will be beautiful but when we went there was not much out apart from some very noisy frogs which caused great interest.",
          "These gardens are nice and relaxing, we enjoyed spending an hour walking around. There's a pond full of turtles - spend a while watching them swimming around - a bit hypnotic!",
          "This place is really beautiful with lots of different types of greenery to see. My favourite was the fountains which had lots of frogs in, and the shady tree walk which was nice in the heat. There's lots of benches to sit down and rest on. Worth a visit, and of course free to",
          "Beautiful and so peaceful place, even it's heavy traffic nearby. Great place to relax and enjoy. Take a time to come and visit, it's nearby Glavni kolodvor (main railway station),",
          "Unfortunately it was closed due to the season. But from the street you could see that it is well kept, there are signs that show you which plant is which and it makes you want to come in another season. Put it into your plan.",
          "Peaceful place for an afternoon walk. Clean, quaint park. Doesn't take more than an hour to fully walk though. Nice chance to breakup the city feel of the city.",
          "Just few minutes by walk from Hotel Esplanada you will find these green Heart of the town. You can relax and enjoy while walking in garden and discovering biological diversity.",
          "Many plants are present Nice place to walk I think Cafe in this place will attract more people to come Announcement about WC was not clear Care of the garden is deficient",
          "The garden has more name tags for the plants. But seriously, this is only slightly off the beaten track, and it never seems to be crowded. And it's gorgeous. Go there.",
          "Really nice gardens in the heart of Zagreb. AN excellent tourist attraction and a very calm and quiet area. The trees are beautiful and is a nice place to wander through and escape the hustle and bustle of the city. The pond also has turtles in it. One of the better botanical",
          "Botanical oasis carefully cherished during so many yeas in the very heart of Zagreb. It offers peace from hectic city life, beautiful plants and great landscapes.",
          "During our visit of Zagreb during the summer we went to the botanical garden because we had seen everything at the top of the must-see attractions and we were quite bored. It takes some time from Ben Jelacic square to get to this garden, so if you do not like walking rather take",
          "Lots and lots of plants from exotic land to indigenous species. Small pond with bridge reminiscent of Monet\u2019s Garden.",
          "It was pleasant enough and it has free bathrooms, and benches to sit down for a break in a nice setting. It does have a few trees that we'd never seen before but other than a quiet break and a nice little walk around it is not worth seeking out at the expense of missing out on",
          "My wife and I were just there at the end of the season and missed how beautiful it is. We did find lovely just walking around the gardens.It's close to the downtown, main train station, hotels and parks. There was now charge to walk around.",
          "A short walk away from the main part of town, this is a quiet sanctuary. It wasn't busy at all when we visited in October. Not many flowers at this time of year, but full of trees and bushes.",
          "Visited the Botanical Garden located in the next block from my hotel. i was really impressed with the variety of plants and the wonderful colors displayed in September. It was a warm afternoon and the park was full of couples seated in the grassy areas and on the seats. I",

          "We visited on a day when we had only a few hours in the city so was a rushed visit. If had the time we could have easily spent a couple of hours in here. Recommend to all visitors of the city",
          "Ok, it was late August and they had a very hot summer, but the garden looked dry and tired. The nicest area was the water gardens. What I liked was that the gardens are free admission and many Zagreb citizens were enjoying a quiet break from the city. Plants are well-marked",

          "What a delightful small-ish garden, I'm surprised it's free to enter. I particularly liked the ponds around the small fountain and the pond in the hot house as they were covered in fabulous lilies. It looks like the garden is undergoing renovations (including the big hot house)",

          "It wasn't initially on my list when I went to Zagreb, but after learning it has free entrance I checked it out. It is not very far from the centre, and very near to the train station, so it's easy to find. It's a pretty little garden with lots of species, lots of flowers and it",

          "If you have a spare time in Zagreb I think its the best solution. It's like a fresh breath in the city with so many plants and trees. Free entrance :)",
          "If you want to run away from the loud and noisy streets of Zagreb - it is the nice place! Completely free, but quite cosy ;) however, the best view and experience is from end of spring till start of autumn :))",
          "Most beautiful walk through the nature in the heart of the city - visit Zagreb's botanical garden, in spring, then in summer and funally in autumn. See different life blooming in different seasons, cross the bridge and observe the turtles, see what will be planted next... Take a",
          "A beautiful green garden in the down town area of the city. Visit can be educational (countless species of plant are just waiting to be discovered), but also romantic. It is worthy to mention that the entrance is free! Highly recommended!",
          "This is not a very large garden, but very pleasant to wander round and a great place to eat your sandwich on a nice sunny day. Being Autumn, the trees were particularly attractive with the different leaf colours.",
          "I hope they do get the conservatory open someday. It has been closed for 100 years if I remember correctly. They said the remodel was supposed to be done in 2014 well as of 2016 it looks like the renovations hadn't started yet. The only glasshouse open to the public has lily",
          "The garden was of modest size . There were many beds with some labeled plants . The building had some interesting details . In all it was not a must see place but of some interest",
          "Great variety of plants and trees. Really enjoyed walk around it and sit down after exhausting city tour. Although, I felt a bit sad for the turtles in the dirty little pool.",
          "Just minutes away from the heart of the city centre, there's no better way to spend an hour or two away from the asphalt jungle than strolling around the Botanical Gardens",
          "Lovely small botanical garden in the Zagreb Lower town, nicely laid out with related species exhibited together. I would love to visit again in summertime with more flowers in bloom, but it was really beautiful even now (October), and so peaceful!",
          "The botanical gardens possess a calming charm which really compliments the bustle of town, like how red complements green.",
          "In the middle of the town close to the National Theater,and hotels.Good selection of Balkan area plants.Nice Victoria Glass House with South American water lillies. We visited on October the garden was preparing for winter and many of the palms and other potted plants were on",
          "If you like nature, than you'll also like this little oasis in the city center (it's about 10-15 minutes walking-distance from the main square). The only thing you should definitely check before visiting is whether they'll be open at the time you plan to visit. They have the",
          "This garden is next to the central train station. An entrance is free of charge. It is so pretty in October with plenty of leaves in brown and golden colours. It is worth visit.",
          "Went there with my girlfriend and it was very nice. I especially liked the turtles in the pond. Worth going in the summer.",
          "While on a guided tour we had the afternoon to ourselves and were looking forward to the Botanical Gardens. When we arrived at 2:15 we were shown a sign at a gate that indicated that the gardens were closing in 15 minutes. We entered for a short time and would have loved to",
          "This is an ideal spot to while away a couple of hours. Lots of interesting plants, trees and flowers to admire. It has the added attraction of being free.",
          "I wasn't particularly impressed by the Botanical Gardens. Aside from a few clusters of trees and the occasional moribund flower bed, there just wasn't that much to see. I expect it would be outright depressing on an overcast day. I spent more time getting there than I actually",
          "We visited this botanical garden which is free. It was really peaceful and charming. We took beautiful pictures. Worth a visit.",
          "Located near the main train station is this surprisingly enjoyable garden. There were formal paths weaving through the grounds. There was an alpine garden, a rock garden and a large pond and although they were well camouflaged, there were several turtles here sunning themselves",
          "The garden was very close to our hotel and we spent about an hour walking through the grounds; we enjoyed seeing so many familiar plants and flowers as well as a few very unusual ones. I think things are flagging a bit since it's late in September; however, my husband and I",
          "We wanted to just see this but it was only \"average\". Nothing spectacular; looks like it needed improvement and tidying up. Free entry.",
          "Zagreb has a pleasingly large number of green spots to stop and ponder, and along with Maksimir park this is one of the best. An enjoyable mix of colourful bedding plants, looping paths in the shade and water features, all without charge await you.",
          "When u have a few hours to spare visit this garden. Its free with some lovely plants, trees and even some turtles in the lake",
          "the garden is not very big so in 1 hour or so it is easy to visit, it's well kept and I took nice photos inside.",
          "worth walking around if not just for the fresh air some interesting plants and very green give it a look",
          "It is really crazy to write anything alse but - beautiful words for this place.. In a city center, but amazing garden hidden from the city rush.. When you go there do not expect nothing- just enjoy beautiful nature and quite place where you can relax, read a book and recharge",
          "I was initially unimpressed by this garden alongside the main railway line and approached through a children's playground covered in graffiti. As I got further into it however I liked it more and more. There is an overwhelming impression that it could really do with more funds",
          "This Botanical Garden is located right in the heart of Zagreb. Very close to the Central Train Station. It is quite big and the entrance is for free so if you ever visit Zagreb, never skip this! Best months to visit are: april, may, june, september, october.",
          "We were there on a hot day and decided to take a stroll to cool off,which we certainly managed, as most of it was shady. It\"s a nice stroll around, we were laughing at the turtles in the pond and strolled across it. Why not do it? It's a short,but pleasant walk!",
          "the garden is nice but not that impressive, I'll not come back there there's also a contruction site at the garden at the time",
          "Not very big but nice and shady. Great for a stroll. Close to the city centre. Even better if you're interested in plants!",
          "Not big but well kept and shady. Turtles swimming in the lake and frogs in the lilly pools. No signs of litter mentioned in a previous review. Pleasant place to while away half an hour or so",
          "A beautiful green oasis in the centre of town. Great place to come and relax. So close to the city rumble but jet so far and peaceful.",
          "Located not far from the Westin Hotel. Maps are posted at entrances and throughout park, but very easy to get turned around. There is not a logical path to follow to see everything; we did lots of backtracking trying to follow the map numbers. We saw many beautiful flowers,",
          "It is for me one of the nices places in Zagreb during hot summer months. It is not very big, but if you had enough od the city, come by to this green oase.",
          "I was surprised to see that this place had so few visitors. It is located very close to the city centre, and yet few tourists seem to venture into the Botanical Garden when they have some time to spare. It's their loss. This is a good botanical garden - maybe not one of the",
          "Nice plants, nice peopels, nice atmosphere when you relaxed in this beautiful nature in the center of town",
          "The trees are nice and some bushes but the flowering plants need water and weeding. The oriental bridge over the pond with the turtles and water/land lilies is nice. Maybe a few more benches out of the sun and some gardening. Cafe or refreshment facility would help on a warm",
          "Very disappointed. Neglected formal beds full of weeds, litter in the pond, closed & damaged glasshouses. But a cool shady place for a quiet time. Free to get in.",
          "It was ok- wouldn't do it again. Looking for something to do while waiting for our flight in Zagreb. It was serene but nothing too exciting to see and needed a bit of attention as far as upkeeping.",
          "Was disappointed by this garden. It needs more care paying to it. All the roses needed dead heading when we were there for example.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed visiting the beautiful botanical garden. It is very close to the train station and so if you have some extra time, I would recommend visiting.",
          "This might not be the biggest botanical garden, but it is beautiful and so accessible! It's excellent to walk through as you explore the city. There is good signage labeling plant species for study, and is very well kept.",
          "A small but pretty botanical garden. Took many closeup photos of the flowers. Very peaceful. Restrooms available within the garden. Lovely little pond.",
          "Very nice garden with signs by the trees and plants and places to sit. Beautiful and everyone talks quietly.",
          "having visited other botanical gardens around the world i thought this one lacked the same level of care and attention that the others did. having said that i'm sure there are lots of good specimens to be seen. the best bit for us was the turtles in the pond.",
          "Small botantical gardens which need more development. A basic garden with trees, bushes, fllower, and plants. Nothing unusual but a relaxing plan to take a 45 minute break or so. We did see a heron and some frogs.",
          "Green house is beautiful! There is also a small bridge and many different, interesting flowers and trees. Not the best option when it's raining.",
          "It's simply beautufull place to rest and breath after visiting city center. I suggest everyone to get here and take a rest",
          "I visited there because I wanted to join the musical performance by local association. It turned out that the musical performance was below expectation and the park is nothing good in particular.",
          "This is not Kew, but it was lovely to stroll around on a balmy evening as part of our walk around the lower town. Added bonus: free toilets!",
          "I feel this botanical garden is not finished, lots still to do & some dilapidated, but it is a great space to wander or sit on a warm day.",
          "The Botanical Gardens are a pleasant, quiet refuge from central Zagreb. They are well laid out with a good deal of explanation and information in both Croatian and English. The plantings are varied and arranged very attractively, and there are multiple paths to wander along",
          "A lovely way to while away a few hours in the afternoon with a book a coffee and walk, the gardens were interesting and well kept",
          "Free to get in, and some things to look at. This will only take half an hour or so to wander around. Turtles and frogs were interesting, and the water lilies in flower were stunning. Some of the buildings are being renovated, and some of the sections look like they need a bit of",
          "Very beautiful compact garden in Zagreb, near the train station, within walking distance of upper and lower Zagreb. Many species of flowers and trees, well organized and plotted. An interesting way to spend about an hour. No admission charge, no rest rooms, no food.",
          "A small botanical garden with a rather limited variety of plants, but still a nice place to take a stroll or read a book on a sunny day.",
          "Amazing Botanical Garden, with so many species of plants, flowers, bushes, trees, etc etc. One of the best botanical gardens in the whole Europe. Must to visit!",
          "Very beautiful in Spring! Could use some more maintenance but over all very very enjoyable and relaxing. Must visit if you are in Zagreb.",
          "I came here at the start of spring, so it was probably a bit early in the season. Regardless, there was still plenary to see and the garden was quite beautiful. I wish I could have seen it in summer with everything in bloom.",

          "Zagreb has a huge number of green spaces, with this great botanical garden a key feature. Trees and plants are helpfully labelled and there are many paths for a quiet wander",
          "not very big but charming. walking distance to the railroad station and to Hotel International. Not far from the center.",
          "They've done a good job of making the park feel secluded given it has a busy road on the north and several train tracks on the south. We spent a half hour here and saw the whole park. You could take longer but hard to imagine spending a whole hour here unless you were either",
          "Best to visit sometime between spring and autumn while plants are green and flowering. Beautiful place, a must visit while in Zagreb!",
          "Great quiet place near the main train station, and the center of the town. There is never too many people, so you can just sit and relax, like you are somwhere in the nature, not in the capital of Croatia. :) the best part of the year to see it is of course, the spring, when all",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to see the gardens, but as I was staying close by I paid a visit. It's free which is good, and a nice place to walk around for half an hour. It's very small so don't think Kew gardens and as I know nothing about botany I can't say much on the plants",
          "Really nice and relaxing place to take a walk. Placed in the center of the city, near railway station.",
          "The botanical garden in Zagreb was founded in 1889 and it is a part of the University of Zagreb. It is a peaceful oasis in the city\u2019s center perfect for walking, relaxing and admiring more than ten thousand plant species from all over the world.",
          "Been here twice. The first time in Summer and in October. Both times were great. Some lovely colours, even in the unseasonably cold October. Great photography exhibition in the pavilion also.",
          "Founded in 1889, this botanical garden (there are TWO in Zagreb!) is the oldest in Croatia, and as it is statutorily protected as a monument of THAT TIME-PARK ARCHITECTURE it must be preserved as it was at its foundation! Though, it saw better days and the lack of financing is",

          "just a nice place to walk for an hour on a sunny day, with a pond and bridges, and ofcourse- beautifull plants,",
          "Not exactly a stunning botanical garden, but it is tucked away, is very near my hotel (the Esplanade) and after spending much of the day in the Lower Part of Zagreb and walking around among many people, it was nice to escape to this and just have some time to reflect and take in",
          "It's not huge, but it's worth it. The plants are well cared for and the walk around is very peaceful. The best part is that it's right there in the middle of the city so if you need something to do for an hour, do yourself a favor and check it out.",
          "Nice little garden to walk through. As the sign clearly states as you go through (from 1932 or something), it's not for lazing but for having an intellectual look at the plants (and if you misbehave the may use force to get you out). Just nice to be part of nature for a little",
          "Free of charge and a nice place for a stroll... You can spend a good 30 minutes around the grounds but it's not one of the most interesting ones I've been to... Thankfully I was in good company which made everything much more fun... The bathroom, big NO NO!!!",
          "Very Ok. Will appeal only to botany students. A bit small & not much information available about this garden.",
          "This place is about 3 minutes from the Esplanade Hotel and is free to enter, so is well worth a look, particularly if you're staying nearby. The gardens themselves are quite small but relatively well-kept. The aquatic plants were interesting, as was the terrapin pool. We didn't",
          "If you stay in Westin or Esplanade hotel, you can walk over in 5mins to the garden. Especially in summer time, when it is very hot in town, you can find plenty of shadow places here. Catch a book, find an empty place to seat and enjoy. Within minutes you feel yourself in another",
          "The Zagreb botanical gardens aren't huge, but they are free, which is pretty cool. The selection isn't as extensive as other major city gardens, but it's a nice place to wander for a little while and get lost among the trees. There are nice benches and it is close to other",
          "Always worth a visit, small but lovely, a jewel among parks in Zagreb. Free entrance as well, hope it doesn't change. Go there.",

          "We were two families with young kids. The walk inside the garden was pleasant. The different types of trees makes it very enchanting. The ponds are beautiful, look for turtles and frogs. As a note of caution be aware of the mosquitoes.",

          "It is very small in the heart of the city. I really liked it but a small ant bit me. So beware. It itches a lot. Besides that it is quiet and peaceful",
          "We tried to get in in March when it opens in April so that was our own fault but do check out opening months beforehand to avoid disappointment! We could see through and the gardens look lovely so I'd definitely go if they had been open.",

          "Zagreb has lots of parks, Maksimir being the biggest with its zoo and great trails for running. But in the center of town, a block west of the Esplanade Hotel, the Botanical Garden provides a verdant oasis in the city center. Admission is free. It is relatively small (around 12",
          "The garden is 125 YO and is approx.12 acres, set in a park/arboretum format. It is affiliated with the U of Zagreb, which might explain why it is so meticulously maintained, vis-a-vis botanical gardens which rely on minimal staff plus volunteers. Most plants are properly",

          "Not the most extensive gardens you'll see but nonetheless a nice spot in the centre of town - 3 minute walk from the Railway Station. The area with the ponds was our favourite as we spotted lots of frogs. A nice place to stroll and sit for an hour or two.",

          "I would support more of places like that in Zagreb. Instead of fountains we should build more of green spots throughout the city. When you enter the garden it really hushes all the noise from the cars and trams. And it is a free entrance.",

        "wiki": "Maksimir Stadium (Croatian: Stadion Maksimir), is a multi-use football stadium based in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. It takes its name from the surrounding neighbourhood of Maksimir. The venue is primarily the home of Dinamo Zagreb, the top club of the country with 20 league titles, but it is also the home venue of the Croatia national football team. First opened in 1912, it has undergone many facelifts, and its current layout dates from a 1997 rebuilding. The stadium also sometimes hosts other events such as rock concerts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe stadium was first opened on 5 May 1912. On 26 May 1941, a representative of the Ustashe fascist government of the Independent State of Croatia addressed young Zagreb students at their meeting at the Maksimir Stadium, and at one point ordered the Serbian and Jewish students to be segregated, but the children disobeyed. Soon afterwards, in June 1941, rebel youths burned the stadium down. In 1977, a movie Operation Stadium was made to commemorate the segregation incident.\nWhen the UEFA Euro 1976 final tournament was held in Yugoslavia, Maksimir hosted the Netherlands v. Czechoslovakia semi-final match and the Netherlands v. Yugoslavia third place match.\nMaksimir was the central venue for the 1987 Summer Universiade hosted by the city of Zagreb.\nIn 1990, several events happened at Maksimir. On 13 May, the Dinamo Zagreb\u2013Red Star Belgrade riot took place, an infamous riot involving Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade supporters. The last match of the Yugoslavia national football team was hosted at Maksimir on 3 June. On 17 October of the same year, Croatia played the United States in what was Croatia's first match in the modern era.\nIn 1998, plans were made for a massive renovation, and the first phase started the same year. The old northern stand was demolished and a new one built within a year. This renovation increased Maksimir's seating capacity to 38,079.\nAfter 1992, for 16 years the Croatian football team had a proud unbeaten record at this stadium in any competitive match, however on 10 September 2008 (two years after suffering a 2-0 defeat at the same venue) England became the first team to beat Croatia in Zagreb, winning 4-1, ending a thirty match undefeated streak.\nIn the summer of 2011, a little, but much needed \"facelifting\" was made on the stadium. All seats were replaced, a new drainage system, under-soil heating and automatic watering were installed along with a new turf, the athletic track was covered with blue artificial grass and all brick surfaces were covered in blue cloth.\n\n\n== Capacity per sector ==\nFour stands (8 sectors) contribute to the total seating capacity of 35,423:\n\nNorth stand (up): 4,510\nNorth stand (down): 4,950\nNorth stand (VIP): 300\nWest stand (up): 5,101\nWest stand (down): 6,369\nWest stand (VIP): 748\nEast stand: 9,514\nSouth stand: 3,931\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nThe stadium has also been used as the venue for some big concerts, including:\n\nOn 12 July 1983, Dire Straits held a concert to promote their fourth studio album Love Over Gold as a part of band's Alchemy Live Tour (1983).\nOn 5 September 1990, David Bowie performed a sold-out concert as a part of his Sound+Vision Tour (1990).\nIn 2000, Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107 Gibonni performed a concert in front of 32,000 people, promoting his album Judi, zviri i be\u0161timje (2000).\nOn 22 June 2005, Bijelo Dugme performed a reunion concert for a crowd of 70,000 people on their Tour 2005. (2005).\nOn 17 June 2007, Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson performed a concert for a crowd of 70,000 people as a part of his Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj Tour (2007).\nOn 9 and 10 August 2009, U2 performed two sold-out concerts for 124,012 people as a part of their U2 360\u00b0 Tour (2009-2011).\nOn 8 June 2011, Bon Jovi performed a concert for a crowd of 33,698 people as a part of their Bon Jovi Live Tour, which supports the band's sixth compilation album, The Greatest Hits. (2011).\nOn 11 June 2012, Madonna was scheduled to perform a concert as a part of her MDNA Tour, but the concert was cancelled due to logistic reasons.\nOn 23 May 2013, Depeche Mode was scheduled to perform a concert as a part of their Delta Machine Tour, but the concert was changed to the Arena Zagreb due to logistic reasons.\nOn  13 August 2013, Robbie Williams performed a concert in front of 45,000 people, featuring Olly Murs as his opening act, as a part of Take the Crown Stadium Tour (2013).\n\n\n== Renovation plans ==\n\nAccording to the 1998 plans, renovation was to include lowering the lawn and making the \"ring\" round the pitch in the place of running track and thus gain 16,000 new seats with the annex to the south stand with the final addition of a modern roof structure. Maksimir was to have 60,000 comfortable sitting places and was to be an exclusively football stadium like many others in Europe.\nIt has additionally been planned to build: new premises for Club's Management, Elegant \"Blue Lounge\", Big \"Trophy room\", football school premises, changing room, coach staff room, sports hall with gym, out patient clinic, restaurant, luxury hotel (\"A\" category) with 46 beds for visiting teams special importance will be given to the building which will connect west stand to the north stand. By this, all the conditions for hosting and organizing big European matches would be fulfilled, including UEFA offices, press club, press center, V.I.P. hospitality, etc. With that, the venue was to be one of the best equipped stadiums in Europe. However, in the beginning of the 2000s, the renovations were suspended.\nAs of December 2007, the public was awaiting the presentation of new stadium, and in 2008 city government presented two potential stadiums, new Maksimir and Vulkan (Volcano) which is supposed to be built on another location (Kajzerica) in Zagreb and old Maksimir should then be knocked down, the citizens were to choose which one they want on the referendum predicted to take place somewhere in the near future. However, the city government never made any progress with referendum or these plans and the stadium remains to be a problem to the city for a decade now.\nBetween 1997 and 2015, a total of HRK 800 million (c. \u20ac108 million) has been spent renovating the stadium.\n\n\n== Kajzerica proposal ==\n\nStadion Kajzerica was a proposed new football stadium to be built in the Kajzerica neighborhood in Zagreb, intended to replace Stadion Maksimir as the home of the Croatia national football team and Dinamo Zagreb.\nThe design competition for the new stadium was won by architect Hrvoje Njiri\u0107 in May 2008. The winning design, nicknamed The Blue Volcano (Croatian: Plavi vulkan) by the press, would have a capacity of 55,000 and would include a blue-coloured polycarbonate dome exterior and a cloud-like structure suspended above the stadium covered in photovoltaic panels.The project had originally been intended to go ahead after it gained approval in a public referendum in which citizens of Zagreb would vote whether they would rather have the current Stadion Maksimir torn down and re-built in the same location (which would cost at least 264 million euros, according to offers submitted by construction companies) or replaced by an entirely new stadium at Kajzerica (whose construction cost is still unknown).According to the initial plan the first option would include building a smaller venue at Kajzerica between 2009 and 2011 which would then be used to host Dinamo Zagreb's matches while Maksimir stadium is undergoing rebuilding in the period between 2011 and 2014. The other option would include building the purpose-built 55,000 capacity Blue Volcano at Kajzerica, which would then become the Blues' permanent home.\nHowever, the referendum about the stadium, which had originally been scheduled for June 2008, was postponed several times since and has not been held.\nIn October 2012, the project was abandoned, to be briefly revived in 2013 with an eye to a possible UEFA Euro 2020 bid, and again in 2018, following Croatia's historic success in the World Cup.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Broken Relationships (Croatian: Muzej prekinutih veza) is a museum in Zagreb, Croatia, dedicated to failed love relationships. Its exhibits include personal objects left over from former lovers, accompanied by brief descriptions.\nThe \"museum\" began as a traveling collection of donated items. Since then, it has found a permanent location in Zagreb. It received the Kenneth Hudson Award for Europe's most innovative museum in 2011.In 2017, the museum saw more than 100,000 visitors, making it the 11th most visited museum in Croatia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was founded by two Zagreb-based artists, Olinka Vi\u0161tica, a film producer, and Dra\u017een Grubi\u0161i\u0107, a sculptor. After their four-year love relationship came to an end in 2003, the two joked about setting up a museum to house the left-over personal items. Three years later, Grubi\u0161i\u0107 contacted Vi\u0161tica with this idea, this time in earnest. They started asking their friends to donate objects left behind from their break-ups, and the collection was born. It was shown to the public for the first time in 2006, in Glyptotheque Zagreb, as a part of the 41st Zagreb Salon.\n\nIn the years that followed, the collection went on a world tour, visiting Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Macedonia, the Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Between 2006 and 2010, the collection was seen by more than 200,000 visitors. Along the way, it gathered new items donated by members of the public; more than 30 objects were donated by Berliners alone during the exhibition in that city in 2007.In the meantime, after unsuccessful attempts to interest the Croatian Ministry of Culture in finding a temporary location for the museum, Vi\u0161tica and Grubi\u0161i\u0107 decided to make a private investment and rent a 300-square-meter (3,200 sq ft) space in Zagreb's Upper Town, making it the city's first privately owned museum. The museum, finally opened in October 2010, proved popular with foreign tourists in particular, not only due to its original subject matter, but also the fact that it is open seven days a week, unlike other museums in the city.\n\nIn May 2011, the Museum of Broken Relationships received the Kenneth Hudson Award, given out by the European Museum Forum (EMF). The award goes to \"a museum, person, project or group of people who have demonstrated the most unusual, daring and, perhaps, controversial achievement that challenges common perceptions of the role of museums in society\", rating the \"importance of public quality and innovation as fundamental elements of a successful museum\". The EMF's judging panel noted:\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships encourages discussion and reflection not only on the fragility of human relationships but also on the political, social, and cultural circumstances surrounding the stories being told. The museum respects the audience's capacity for understanding wider historical, social issues inherent to different cultures and identities and provides a catharsis for donors on a more personal level.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships is described by its founders as an \"art concept which proceeds from the (scientific) assumption that objects (in the broadest sense, i.e., matter as a whole) possess integrated fields\u2014\u2018holograms\u2019 of memories and emotions\u2014and intends with its layout to create a space of \u2018secure memory\u2019 or \u2018protected remembrance\u2019 in order to preserve the material and nonmaterial heritage of broken relationships\".The project is divided into several segments:\nMaterial remains layout includes the objects and documents like photographs, letters, or messages. Items are presented with dates and locations of the relationship, and annotations by their anonymous donors. Due to physical space constraints, older exhibits may be archived and transferred to the virtual part of the museum.\nVirtual web museum enables the registered visitors to become donors through uploading their images and documents. Donors can decide whether to open their personal collections for viewing by other users of the museum.\nConfessional is the interactive part of the museum in which visitors can store their objects or messages, or record their confessions in a restricted and intimate space.\n\n\n== Museum of Broken Relationships in L.A. ==\nSince 2016 the Museum of Broken Relationships can be found in two cities; the original one is located at the Upper Town in Zagreb, Croatia, while the newly founded one was located in Los Angeles, USA.\nDuring his stay in Zagreb, famous American lawyer John B. Quinn visited the Museum of Broken Relationships, and he liked it so much that he decided to start a cooperation with the founders of the Museum. The Museum of Broken Relationships in Los Angeles opened its doors to the public on June 4, 2016 and was located in the heart of Hollywood, with Alexis Hyde as the Director. The size of the venue is around a thousand square meters, and most of the items included in the museum come from the collection initiated in Los Angeles, while a smaller portion of the items were from the Zagreb collection. The Los Angeles location is closed as of November 2017 while looking for a new location.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseum of Failure, inspired by the Museum of Broken Relationships\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVi\u0161tica, Olinka; Grubi\u0161i\u0107, Dra\u017een (2009).

          "This place is fantastic! The whole idea of it is amazing and unique. I especially enjoyed that it wasn\u2019t only romantic relationships and that you included friendships, parent-child relationships etc.. It was really cool how you used things from places all around the world and it",
          "Cool stories behind every object. Also an awesome museum shop and a nice coffee place. Due to long opening hours you can really take your time :)",

          "Probably the worst museum I have ever visited. Te lady at the entrance was neither friendly nor welcomming. Entrance is 40 kn, way to much for what the museum offers and given the fact that the objects were donated. Some of the stories are definitely fake, some of the objects",

          "To cut a long story short, I was advised by a tourism professional and colleague of mine to definitely pay this museum a visit, but apart from the weird concept of sad stories, you really have to start reading all the stories... and it didn't take long before boredom set in.",

          "I got lucky as only a few if us were visiting when I went in so time and space and quiet to read the stories. What an incredible array of tales. Some of heart break and others of the pain or relief of losing a loved one. So glad I went and a great cafe too. Lovely people. There",
          "What a great idea for a museum. All relationships have a story and broken ones are especially poignant. It's sad, touching, funny and thought provoking. Well worth an hour or so visit. Now I just have to go find something to contribute",
          "What a great museum concept and found it very reasonable entry price. Takes about 1-1.5hrs to walk through and ready everything properly. Was a great museum staff were very friendly also :)",

          "A very interesting place with lots of great items and memories attached. Would definitely recommend.",
          "I was in and out in about a half hour. Certainly different, and I am very impressed that they made a museum out of the subject matter. It is a work in progress, as you can contribute, if you have the desire to do so. Some good laughs ...",
          "Some thought provoking stuff. Some of it funny, some of it sad and some of it a bit weird/dark. Definitely worth a visit when you\u2019re next in Zagreb.",
          "Genius idea, to take submissions from all over the world that take broken hearted people\u2019s items representing their lost lives? Children, lives, parents, and exhibit them with explanation and a few words. I found it deeply moving in places, and was happy to write something in",
          "Little vignettes, mementos & their stories make your life seem very ordinary. Very much a voyeurs trip reading about the cracks in other peoples romances. 30 to 60 minutes is about all you can absorb.",

          "The museum is very nice and it\u2019s a different vibe from what we\u2019re used to when referring to museums. Not boring at all",
          "I had heard of this attraction before, and as I only had a couple of hours in Zagreb, I chose to visit the museum and it turned out to be the best way to spend the afternoon. Spent about an hour for lunch at the museum restaurant, another one and half hours for the exhibits and",
          "Maybe not to everyone's taste, but we enjoyed it There is a fair amount to see and read. This can be exhausting so before long you will start to pick and choose what to read",
          "We had just been to the nearby Museum of Broken Relationships which is quite small and rather underwhelming, so did't have particularly high expectations of this museum, but we loved it and are so glad we visited. Many of the stories are amusing and some bitter about",
          "I would recommend visiting, you might be lucky enough to find a story from your own country. There are so many stories and they are so different. Our own story was from a Cape Town guy who was changing a light bulb for his girlfriend while she was breaking up with him. He walked",
          "I was intrigued by the name of the museum so I decided to go for it. It's a small museum but it has enough items for you to pore over and ponder somewhat about your own broken relationships. It's an exhibit of mementos from broken relationships. Some explanations are downright",
          "when i heard of this museum...i found it to be interesting. give away those things tat were given to you when you are deeply in love and then to write up ur stories of ur break-ups...",
          "This is an unusual museum consisting of artifacts & stories of lovers broken relationships. Some are sad while others cause you to smile or even laugh out loud.",
          "This museum was highly recommended in tourist books and also our guide. It is a very clever idea and well displayed. Almost all relationships are romantic, but not all. It becomes repetitious after reading all of these heartbreaks.",

          "Cleared the museum in about 30 mins as it is a pretty small museum. A few stories were interesting and it is decently priced (30 kr for students, 40 kr for adults). Drop by if you have time, else I would recommend other activities (walking tours, walking about the market, etc)",
          "Recommended to us we spent an enjoyable hour in this most unusual museum full of mementoes from broken relationships. Mostly human stories but some about relationships with objects as well as people. Each exhibit has its own story in English as well asSerbo Croat. Well set out",
          "Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this museum. It was heartbreaking reading some of the notes left, but others put a smile on your face. I would recommend visiting here without a doubt! It was my first place I visited while in Zagreb and I will be back again on my next",
          "I thought this place was very interesting. It was intriguing how the stories were presented with a single item. Each thing kind of had you wondering before you actually read the story, what tale it told. I have been to anything like it. I also really liked that fact that the",
          "What a quirky museum. Great way to spend some time reading the stories of pieces people have donated in regards to their broken relationships. Some were sad and some were very amusing.",
          "Just not for me. Looked forward to this based on lots of reviews, but all I saw was rooms of junk which would have only meant something to the person who donated it. I lost the will to live after two minutes, but my wife lasted the course. I waited at a seat at the door and",
          "Huge amount of exhibits requires equall amount of time. Some sort of sections whit simmilar stories would be helpful for visitors with limited time to spend in one place as is the case with sightseeing.",
          "Although I have a 35 years happy marriage I am really impressed. These kind of museums are my favorite.",
          "When you're in Zagreb just give this museum a go. Definitely a different.kind of museum. Lots of arts with nice stories accompanied with the objects.",
          "In heart of Zagreb, we got told to go here and we did. I am not a huge museum fan but this was so uniquely different.... worth a visit for the 40 kunas it cost. Emotional, fun, sad describes this place, if you do nothing else see this place. Also has awesome little shop and cafe",
          "Visiting this museum felt like I was reading the journals or diaries of strangers. Some of the exhibits truly touched my heart. A really special museum and would recommend to anyone who appreciates some kind of romance!",
          "Very interesting and unique place! No place like it really. A bit sad and a bit funny. Has to be done when in Zagreb!",
          "Fabulous museum. Put together so well. Felt like reading every story which we did. So unique. I feel it is underrated and must be on the top 'must see' attractions of Croatia. Superb...",
          "Intriguing concept, but the reality was underwhelming. There were a few clever or interesting stories, but mostly it was just stuff, not unlike a sparse garage sale.",
          "I really did enjoy this museum, unlike your ordinary museum you might need a tissue. Some are so silly but others are so touching.",
          "This was a real interesting attraction. The exhibits are real and reflect all sorts of broken relationships. Some are funny, sad, ironic, artistic, bizarre and some are on the edge! Not appropriate for children!",
          "Everyone who at one time love and lost can relate. Funny. Weird. Interesting. A perfect way to spend a lazy rainy afternoon.",
          "I will now visit the one in LA. The museum is a creative way to deal with the heartbreak of dealing with loss. Everyone has loss. This experience gives hope for the future and survival.",
          "This is a great museum if you have absolutely nothing else to do that day. To be fair this is my opinion, it was just not for me. Maybe you will enjoy these stories which I personally think were made up because their is no proof that items are from those people they say there",
          "I can see why some people would like this museum but after 5 minutes I was done. I just didn\u2019t connect with the stories or the artifacts....specifically the scabs collected from a motorcycle riding boyfriend. I\u2019m thinking it was me...I\u2019m 54 and too old to buy into a \u201cmuseum\u201d",
          "This is an unusual museum and one that i have not come across before. To get the most from it you do need to read the article that goes with the prop. It is however not for everyone and after a while you need to become selective on what you read.",
          "As title suggests, this is a museum about broken relationships...although many broken relationships are people focused and for many different and unique reasons, not all of the relationships are people focused. Very interesting!",
          "Weird, wild wonderful little museum. Heart-breaking and surprising and sometimes funny. What a concept.",
          "Part of you wonders why are you visiting a museum highlighting broken relationships. Don't wonder, go visit it!!! Every city has similar museums so something different is great, the Museum of Broken Relationships has objects in display and the story behind this object and it's",
          "Amazing exhibition with so many different items in it. It has so many different stories in there from lots of different relationships. A must go - cheap admission",
          "Very original idea to start a museum where you can leave an item which was given to you by a loved one. The stories behind it and why it was given to the museum are truly interesting and sometimes very moving. A nice set up as well. You will get a rebate if you are a senior",
          "I have been to many museums but never one such as this. It really is about a broken relationship with a lover, a parent or even ones health. Enjoyed it very much.",
          "Unique concept that was much more than we had anticipated- some stories were very touching, others were hilarious. Unexpectedly moving experience.",
          "Not really knowing what to expect I found the first couple of exhibits Ok and a bit of a laugh. Then it became boring. I am sure a lot of people would enjoy this but I thought it was just a lot of rubbish.",
          "You need time to fully take in the exhibit as there is a lot of reading to get the meaning of each item. Some were tragic , while others were quite funny.",
          "The museum\u2019s exhibits are items that are meaningful to people who have broken a relationship. Some are interesting, so not so much. Entry is about $10.00 CDN, and plan to spend about an hour here.",
          "This place is very interesting - not sure the price is worth it but it was amusing and sad a t the same time. Place was heaving so it mut have something going for it!",
          "It's different. Every piece a little story, a reminder that no matter the country, language or culture we are all the same one way or the other.",
          "A friend of mine and myself checked out this museum. We could not speak highly of it. Defo a worthy attraction if you are stopping by in Zagreb.",
          "I started by thinking of the visit as one would at a normal museum, admiring each piece in turn and briefly examining the accompanying caption, but you quickly find that the story behind each item is the real draw. By the end you feel like you've read a book of short stories",
          "Conversation starters for years. All kinds of relationships...dumped-of course, but also the love between parents, love interrupted by life, love of the last memory if a sibling for a refugee. If you are human, you will relate to this museum. Allow 1.5 hours ideally",
          "Recommended by our host we enter with expectations not to be disappointed. God entertainment and the displays interesting",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect with this museum but it was moving and amusing and well worth the visit. Entry fee gets you a guide book in your language except English as the signs are already translated. Displays run from bizarre ( scab from a wound) to tragic (wedding dress never",
          "It was raining the day we visited so we popped in after riding the funicular up to the old town. Some of the displays which are all donated by common people made you laugh and others were moving. It is a small museum and only takes about 45 minutes to see",
          "It\u2019s not a regular museum. There are a stuff with a story of the people. There are a few languages like English, German, Spanish and e.g.",
          "When suggested I come here I thought 'Oh God! Do I really want to bring a girl here!' But actually the museum was surprisingly different to what the name suggests!",
          "This museum is very unique and definitely my favorite museum I have ever visited. This museum will leave you happy and sad at the same time but it's worth the emotional experience. This was my highlight of Zagreb and they were several highlights.",
          "Kind of disappointed because I thought it would be a little more interesting. A lot of reminiscing by others. Interesting as to how some people hold on to objects and not let go.",
          "Many poignant and sad stories. A few happy and funny ones. Very different from the usual museum. Worth a visit. Up on scenic hill. Most would spend 20 or 30 minutes there.",
          "A little museum in Zagreb which honors the heartbreak (and love) at one time or another of couples and the moments and/or things that they have shared or needed to move on. Some of it funny, some of it (the wedding dress) a bit teary. I happened to enjoy this little museum, and",
          "A fascinating museum. Well done. It is worth visiting and spending some time exploring the exhibits.",
          "How do people deal with a broken relationship whether romantic, death of a loved one, or other? People have donated a significant object and explained its relationship to the breakup. Some of funny and others very poignant. Made me think of what I would have chosen to explain",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what I expected when I went in but found myself weirdly enthralled by this eclectic selection of items and the stories they told. Not solely focused on the breakdown of romantic relationships, I found the pieces that told of separation caused by war and those whose",
          "I wasn\u2019t going to see this as it sounded so trite but it was anything but. There are rooms and rooms of artifacts and writings about what they represent, how the relationship was broken off etc. some were cruel, some were sad, some were funny. All were unique. They were from all",
          "Centrally located in Old Town Zagreb this unusual museum is worth a short visit. Although it is uncertain exactly how many of these break-ups can be on the up and up they make for good reads with items related to the break-up displayed. If nothing else you get to say \"I've",
          "We found this exhibition to be by a very clever and left field artistic space All exhibits had their own often sad story and this museum is well worth a visit",
          "Very interesting experience. Some of the stories are shocking and moving, some are a bit \"is it really worthy of being in this museum?\" kind of thing. But all in all, a great place to visit if you have 1-2 hours to spare. It's free of charge if you have the Zagreb Card. A bit of",
          "This was recommended by our guide from another tour today! Interesting stories of relationships (many different forms) gone sour. Some quite amusing, others very sad. We did this in the evening at 730p, great way to spend an hour before the end of the day!",
          "Take an hour to visit this museum - it's open late and inexpensive. Inside will make you laugh, cry, and wonder at the passion and hurt that love inspires. All the items have been donated by people who have lost love - through death, disaster, or a turn of bad luck. It's up the",
          "We had little expectations going here, didn't really know what to expect. But what a great place! A truly unique museum that had us laughing one minute and crying the next.",
          "Very interesting with truly sad stories and really quite funny ones. Take around one hour and is easy to find as it is well signposted",
          "Really nice, fun, and sometimes sad museum that you can stroll around in. It's nice to spend a morning here. Not expensive either!",
          "I went here in the evening and it was not crowded. I loved the axe specifically among other items. There is a bistro inside and also souvenir shop.",
          "We had a great time in this museum - a great selection of exhibits telling a plethora of different stories, from the hilarious to the truly moving! If you have a spare hour in Zagreb, I would definitely recommend!",
          "I suppose if you are bored and artsy or can\u2019t find anything else...truly I spend money to travel and I\u2019m going to take my prescious time to browse through stuff and sob stories? And pay to do it? Really a brainstorm to make money. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll pay for archeological sites and",
          "This small museum contains items That were contributed to the museum by people who lost those they loved due to breakups or death. You may see trinkets, boxes of prepared food, or items of clothing. For some contributors, it\u2019s cathartic to get rid of items that remind you of",
          "Not worth the money I'm afraid. Bit of a let down. Very boring in parts. Suppose to be suitable for children. I Didnt think so. There were a lot nicer places in Zagreb",
          "A very unique museum, haven't been to something like this before. In it you can see different objects from broken relationships and the stories behind them. Some are funny, but some are genuinely sad and will make you shiver. It is definitely an experience I won't forget. Very",
          "Basically you could just get the book From the gift shop. Little sad stories and mementos. Not for me.",
          "The staff was very friendly and museum has a comfortable atmosphere in which to browse the funny and sad displays.",
          "This museum is absolutely not interesting. It show random objects of random people who had a broken relationship in there life... I don't understand how such a thing can be called a museum.",
          "So, only did enough research to know this existed and it seemed to fit in perfectly with a visit to Zagreb's other unique museums. I will say, I expected this to be full of memorabilia from people exiting bad relationships, but it was so much more. We ended up spending far",
          "Plus a cool gift shop. Definitely worth checking out. And in a really great center of town! Ironically there were two weddings happening nearby. Hope they work out.",
          "My wife and I and our two daughters (12 and 7) came across this interesting museum and thought, \"Why not?\" We're not typically the museum type - and even the most interesting we're often eager to leave after an hour. . . This was different - the stories and exhbits were thought",
          "Such an unexpected find! The heart warming and heart breaking stories shared by so many people were a good reminder that we are all human sharing the journey called life.",
          "On our casual stroll around the city, we passed by the museum and were so curious that we had to check it out - and we were glad we did! Behind each object displayed there's a story - some are very heartbreaking and sad, some are funny - but it was really interesting to see how",
          "On a friend\u2019s recommendation I visited this museum and I was pleased that I did! I enjoyed reading the information and imagining the loves lost and broken and the diverse ways in which people dealt with these! It was well worth the visit and some parts were very moving indeed!",
          "Amazing heart breaking stories that you get to learn about. Museum also offers a cafe, outdoor patio, and alcoholic drinks.",
          "I will be honest and say that this was to expensive. I think this museum is ok but its to overrated.",
          "An absolute must-see in Zagreb. Never seen anything like it in the world. Even if you hate museums, you will love this! It is so engaging, the different stories just draw you in. It doesn't take a long time to look at every exhibits, maybe an hour, hour and a half, so you will",
          "Lots of hype about this museum but I left feeling like I wasted some precious time in Zagreb. The only take away for me was a few of the stories related to the grief associated with losing a loved one to death. I guess I don't get it....",
          "This museum has several rooms with the exhibits which include items from different cultures and countries, with their little stories and descriptions. Reading through some of them, I'm a bit sceptical about their authenticity - some are far too dramatic in a theatrical way, some",
          "A small museum in the upper old town, a straight shot from the funicular and (pardon the pun) the cannon tower. You'll hand over your Kunas and then you'll experience the whole range of emotions available to humans. It's a marked contrast from the sometimes flat and introverted",
          "This museum is really too expensive for what it is. We excepted way more. The concept is good, but it is always the same once you read 1-3 story.",
          "This is exactly what the name says. People from all over the world donate personal items symbolic of their broken relationships. Some as weird as a homemade dildo to poignant stories of lace bras from a breast cancer survivor to a Japanese kimono belonging to deceased father.",
          "A quirky yet poignant diversion during our stop in Zagreb. Very interesting reading the witty and touching naratives from people all over the world, thoughtfully and creatively displayed",
          "Extremely unique museum, I definitely recommend it. Some stories are funny, some are extremely sad, but all in all, you shouldn't miss this museum.",
          "Quirky and moving. A lovely idea, not everything was fascinating,but everything was thought provoking and interesting. Delightful experience.",
          "It's actually the quirkiness that gets me each and every time. I feel I must re-connect with this Museum every time I come back to Zagreb. it mirrors the human experience in terms of its messy bathos , not to mention pathos. Remnants of sad glory abound. I alwaysappreciate the",
          "This place is hard to review...it really is more about the mindset of the viewer. Many of the items were very sad but some were quite comical. This isn't an expensive place to visit and you can see and read all of the experiences in about an hour.",
          "Nice little stories, but the exhibits were trivial and could've easily missed without anyone regretting it. This museum was not something special and I cannot understand the hype.",
          "Worth a visit! Kind of fun in a great part of upper town. Take a walk through relationships from far and beyond.",
          "The Museum of Broken Relationships features mementos and stories donated from people around the world. The stories about love are sweet, poignant, some humorous, some heartbreaking. It's an intimate experience that draws you in.",
          "Great little museum, with sometimes strange momentos to go with interesting stories about people\u2019s past marriages,loves or relationships and how they ended, some sad some funny, and a cafe when you\u2019ve finished, worth a visit",
          "Great little museum with various items expressing lots of different emotions when it comes to broken relationships. About an hour gets you through all the exhibits.",
          "I thought this would be a sad and negative experience. Boy was I wrong! This museum is about people sharing closure; not only with relationships with other people, but with things too. It's touching and interesting. Reasonably priced.",
          "There is a difference between artistic expression and silliness. This museum may be off-beat but its displays are silly.",
          "I had the best time going round this museum, such an original idea and so much fun reading about all the relationships and items. Some of the stories were hilarious and some were very touching. I loved this place and only wish it were bigger with more stories! Will definitely be",
          "We were tipped off about this eclectic museum, one however that has a serious intent. Stories about broken relationships, some sad and some funny. Recommended.",
          "If you're looking for something different, visit this museum. Featured items represent a wide variety of \"broken\" or altered relationships, not only with others but also with self. Check out the website to see samples of items on display. The stories are generally sad but can",
          "Nice museum with lots of amazing stories from the funniest to the saddest Quite busy when we visited and some were reading the translated guided aloud... Worth it !",
          "We took a very quick walk thru the museum at the recommendation of our concierge. Quirky, but worth a stop if you have some time. Located in Upper Town. Cafe is quaint as well.",
          "Don\u2019t recommend visiting on a hot day\u2014it was very stuffy inside; their window AC units were no match for the volume of visitors (and open windows, oddly enough). The exhibits were like the subs /r/im14andthisisdeep and /r/2edgy4me had a baby. Ultimately we (my wife and I) felt",
          "Based on the name, I kind of thought this place would be a bit of a silly joke, or just more of a novelty place. But actually I found all the little stories very touching. It's really worth coming here and giving yourself time to see them all.",
          "This was a great museum filled with interesting stories and sad stories. It had my boyfriend and I to really think deeply about the meaning of relationships and the significance of them.",
          "It took me a little longer than usual to decide if I should visit the Museum of Broken Relationships (with my family), but in the end we did go inside. Well, it will be a bit uneasy when you hear the name. Never mind, you will learn the stories, some of which heartbreaking, and",
          "Really enjoyed this museum, a lot of reading but it was very funny and interested to get a peek in people's lives. The only bad thing was that it was too busy, the place isn't that big and sometimes I had to wait before I could see something.",
          "We had a hard time finding this museum that my wife (of 25 years) had to see. We actually had to ask several people and loop around a few times before we finally found it. I found it to be kind of silly and I also felt like I was intruding in peoples personal lives, but I",
          "Great museum with a lot of stories. It is not so big so you can take a look in 30 min. But it is worth to take a visit.",
          "I passed by this museum and I just thought I can make my own museum with my life experiences so I don\u2019t need to hear others",
          "The museum is very disappointing. Disappointing are the stories and the objects. Many stories have nothing to do with love but family. You got depressed from the museum how bad he was, not from broken relationship. In any case, I do not recommend.",
          "I absolutely recommend this unique place. You will feel like you just read a great book, very touching and emotional experience.",
          "Nice museum in between the things you do in Zagreb. Do not expect great halls with gold and ancient displays with paintings. There are nice stories to be read and also some that make you feel sorry for the authors. Staff very kind and helpfull.",
          "While all the Tourist Attractions offer,Castles, Palaces, Forts, Museums and Zoos etc, Zagreb offers a small but an unusual place to visit and that is \" Museum of Broken Relationships \" The place is Centrally located. A small but a beautiful collection from all over the world",
          "We popped in here after visiting the surrounding area. It was a sweet museum and the concept behind it is wonderful. Some sad moments and some completley relatable ones. Good for a lighthearted visit.",
          "Some hilarious, some more somber memories to read at this museum. Great place and cafe as well. The captions explaining each artifact was done with much detailed. Staff we spoke to were helpful and friendly.",
          "The place is full of items people left behind after their relationships was over, every item attached to a short description of the item and it\u2019s significance in the relationship, and how does the relationship ended. Some stories are really sad, some are funny, but most of it",
          "Small place which is up the hill near the funicular railway. Objects on display with a written piece explaining the story behind the breakup or loss. Some things are very humorous but some very sad to read. Will take less than an hour to walk around depending how fast you",
          "Made us feel all type of emotions and it leaves you craving for more. Such an unique museum, it\u2019s absolutely not-to-miss!",
          "I have never experienced a museum like this. Was able to see the entire museum in u set an hour. Really moved, touched and tickled by the exhibits. So very glad we visited this quirky museum.",
          "Love is all you need, feel it and share. Unexpected stories from all over the world were amazing to read",
          "Well worth visit if you have time to spare or you're just wandering around the small city centre. It was quite cheap for entry. The display shared experiences of anonymous every day people from all over the world and their small narrative on their broken relationship, be it from",
          "Many people have told me this place was great and that I still was wondering. However, when I visited it really was interesting and I'd go back. Totally personal and yet enthralling for all. I guess it reminds all of us of some personal circumstances and one way or another. Not",
          "Possibly one of the most interesting museums I have visited anywhere. The layout is fresh and compelling. Most of all the stories you read will stay with you long after you visit. And the women on the reception are super. Well worth a visit!",
          "It was a bit crowded when we were there and sometimes hard to get close enough to the objects. With a valid student ID (also international) you get a student discount.",
          "Museum located on the upper Zagreb where there are several objects with their broken love stories, very interesting and unique museum of its kind.",
          "This museum is so cute. Me and my friends went for a visit this place full of memories and had great time there.",
          "It was fun to read the stories, but after a while, it became a bit boring. It would be nicer if the stories weren't that long. There also was a waiting time of 15 minutes before you could enter the museum.",
          "This museum is not that big but really original. You find a lot of objects people send in by a broken relation (love, illness, death). Somtetimes funny ... sometimes hard.",
          "At the end of our walking tour we came to the museum of broken relationships. Some of the exhibits are quite weird. Went around the museum to see what was of interest for the 5 star reviews. Respect those who liked the exhibits, but our likes are different",

          "Great little museum, loads of items donated from people all over the world with little stories to accompany them, some funny, some just odd and many quite emotional. I took my sister-in-law who\u2019s lived in Zagreb for a year now and she had never been, she loved it! Well worth a",

          "This quirky museum has items donated from people who have broken up and are displayed alongside short stories. Some of the memories are very moving, whilst others had us laughing and some just plain outright shocked us! It\u2019s not purely romantic relationships, there was even an",
          "The museum is certainly different as it covers an unusual topic but well worth the visit. Allow about one hour, signs are also English and there are some surprising items to discover! There is a coffee shop with free WIFI after you finish as well",
          "Really kooky, unusual museum. Stories from all around filled with anger, sorrow, happy memories or just making peace with it all. The parachute did shock me!",
          "Considering the museum is based mostly in Zagreb I didn\u2019t think there would be as many items and stories from all across the world. I was completely wrong as throughout the whole museum there are many different stories from many different places. You can relate to them in so",
          "We loved this place! With this museum being the sole reason we came to Zagreb, it did not disappoint. It was quite small but thoughtfully put together. The personal descriptions of the exhibits were touching and amusing, providing a significant story behind each item written by",
          "At times wacky and funny,then suddenly sad and heart wrenching. Very unexpected. It's well worth the visit.",
          "Brilliant idea! Lots of personal belongings that were donated by people with emotional burdens. Get to see the stories other people go through, quite sobering.",
          "Very much enjoyed the Museum of Broken Relationships. It is a whirlwind of emotions going through the exhibits. Some funny, some very sad, and some that actually make you feel pretty good. Very glad we stopped by and highly recommend the visit.",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Was surprised to see a very different kind of a museum in this beautiful city.",
          "This museum is a curated collection of items that symbolize past relationships along with their stories. It seemed cheezy at first, but was actually entertaining and sobering at the same time. I even found something from my workplace in the USA! Small world! Also, the Broken",
          "Very interesting museum. Some of the stories are very touching but there is also some weird stories. It\u2019s impossible to read the story under air conditioning because it is blowing directly and super cold. Need to find better solution for it. All together I would recommend the",
          "Some things were tragic and some were really funny. So it was not a depressing experience. Your heart is broken then there is the crazy funny story right next to it.",
          "First time ever that we saw this type of museum. Certainly an interesting concept and worth the visit (even if you can\u2019t associate..). There is a nice coffee shop attached where you can wait if only part of your group wants to visit.",
          "Fascinating museum. The more light hearted exhibits come first but then there are more touching and sad ones that follow",
          "Not your typical museum. Interesting to see the displays and the the write up for each one. A little expensive for what it is.",
          "Quite an interesting concept and very well executed. A blend of funny and emotional stories on broken relationships from all walks for life. Worth a visit for sure.",
          "This is a museum full of items sent in by regular people who have gone through a broken relationship in some form or another. You actually don't need to see the items in most cases as the stories dotted around the walls give you everything. Some stories are more sad than others,",
          "Amazing place, designed interesting, and the stories hidden inside are full of joy and sadness. It's kind of funny to visit it with boyfriend/girlfriend, but there is also a book inside where people write their love stories from visiting together. Merch shop is very cool. I've",
          "All stories shown in the museum are raw and full of emotion. Sometimes sad, other times funny or shocking, the stories shown in the museum are worth the visit!",
          "This museum was even more interesting than we expected. The relationship break-up stories are interesting, and it also touches on other loses people experience in their lives. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Loved this small museum. If you want a different experience to the regular types of museum, this is perfect. Some funny, some sad, some tragic stories all based on relationships. A must see in Zagreb.",
          "There are hardly any exhibits in this place. It depicts sad stories. So did not like it much. It\u2019s situated in the old town in one of the lanes near funicular.",
          "Halfway through our walking tour, we passed by this museum, and our local guide gave us an interesting and hilarious explanation of what this museum is all about. Apparently it a place where it collected \"stories and personal experiences\" of broken relationships of all kinds, be",
          "We weren't sure about this museum but because of the great Trip Advisor Reviews, we decided to check it out. So well done. Broken boyfriend / girlfriend relationships. Lost children / husbands / parents / homes. Beautiful stories - each written in Croatian and English. Beautiful",
          "Hi,the museum is a good idea for putting an end to and looking forward,I found some exhibits very meaningful but felt they could do with better stories , exhibits and experiences which they get from all over .",
          "The name is amusing and I was really surprised to see it was recommended by Fodors. However, they were right. It is conveniently located in the upper city, but it has a small flag and could be missed if you are not careful. Inside is nicely lit and has a wide variety of",
          "Interesting museum. Mixture of \u201cbroken relationships\u201d from both break-ups and deaths. Some of the break-ups made me laugh (light bulb story especially) and the deaths made me cry.",
          "This is rated as one of the best things todo in the area. So felt like we had to go. There are some nice/sad/interesting stories to read. So worth a look around",
          "I really enjoyed visiting the museum of broken relationships, I really like how it was different from most other museums in that the exhibits were donated by \u201cordinary\u201d people from all over the world, could have been anyone.",
          "It's a funny museum, with objects and stories linked to some relationship break. Some weird objects, some cute stories, a human museum, above all.",
          "We really enjoying touring the Museum of Broken Relationships and their unique exhibits. Obviously it is a bit sad but there are numerous funny exhibits as well. Also good that not all of the exhibits are about personal relationships but the majority are. Definitely worthwhile",
          "I had low expectation when going to this museum and had a great surprise for the best. This unique establishment presents an interesting spectrum of relations between people and their mates and reflects also on the relation of people with themselves. Highly recommended.",
          "Beautifully presented and very moving. Bring tissues. Excellent customer service and lovely souvenirs as well. A must see in Zagreb.",
          "We were not sure exactly what this was but decided to venture in. What an amazing idea....to chronicle one of the aspects of humans that bridges the gap between us. Who has not had a broken heart, broken relationship? We can relate, we can laugh, smile, cry and find ourselves",
          "I was skeptical at first as to what this museum would be like but it was completely interesting! The stories people tell range from sad to hilarious. The museum can get kind of crowded but you can see the displays out of order. We did the whole thing in about an hour.",
          "An unusual but very engaging and interesting exhibition. A must visit when in Zagreb! Well laid out exhibit of truly personal artefacts and stories.",
          "Interesting, full of life, love and sadness. In the same time makes you happy you\u2019ve lived similar stories and still you\u2019re happy, loved and you love.",
          "Unique museum exhibiting articles and stories from people who broke up. Stories are relevant to modern days. This concept is quite similar to the War Childhood Museum in Sarajevo.",
          "This city is famous of its unique museums, this a good example. Not a typical museum, its tells stories from our lives. Highly recommended.",
          "Must visit if you're in Zagreb, it was one of the highlights of the city, and quite memorable overall.",
          "This museum is truly one of a kind, really recommended visiting if you are in Zagreb, the staff at the front desk are lovely which adds to the museum If you are a story lover then I truly recommend visiting, from sad stories of heartbreaks to stories of hopes this museum has it",
          "Well worth the visit - most interesting museum I\u2019ve been to in Europe thus far. Lots of thought provoking, highly emotional stories from those that have loved, been loved and lost. Left with a changed perspective on the importance of relationships, whether they work out or not.",
          "This is the type of museum we visit to get a break from history and art museums. The name is accurate: filled with mementos from ex-lovers, jilted girlfriends, and cheating husbands, each with an accompanying backstory. Stories range from sad to the absurd. My wife left feeling",
          "This museum is such a treat! My husband and I were delighted with the exhibits we saw the day we visited - you just get lost in the stories and representative artefacts on display to illustrate all sorts of 'broken relationships', human and not. Not to be missed!",
          "It was nice to visit such a different museum. Some of the stories were sad, as break ups are but some where kind of funny. I really enjoyed it!",
          "Some of the exhibition pieces will have you giggling, others will have you holding back the tears. An excellently curated museum with lots of interesting detail and stories. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We visited this museum during our stay in Zagreb. Some of the stories were very sad, many heartbreaking and served as a reminder that most of us have a story to tell and no matter what, it is worth telling. A different and thought provoking museum.",
          "This is a unique small museum. The size gave you time and a reason to read all the comments with the items donated for your review. The stories are great. Broken relationships come in many ways and it was nice to hear how many have dealt with those that happened in their lives.",
          "Lots of things to see and read. Would do well to keep the windows closed and turn the air con up on hot days.",
          "Someone had a very good, innovative idea to create this place and to feature the images and explanations of random people who are coming to grips with relationships that ultimately did not flourish. It's certainly worth a visit and my wife would have given it five stars. She",
          "Well worth the visit, poignant, funny, sad, angry stories of loss. Not all of them are marital relationships or even people relationships. Go read the stories, worth the visit.",
          "Unique museum. Some of the exhibits in it may not be needed, but the majority are very nice and some of them touching. It\u2019s definitely recommended to visit, for its uniqueness.",
          "Visit if you have time. It wouldn\u2019t be my first day there. If you have two days definitely worth stopping at. Located in the upper city. Very easy to get to.",
          "If you see no other museums in Zagreb, go to this one. It is thoughtful and thought provoking. You won\u2019t spend a better 45 minutes in Zagreb.",
          "The principle behind the concept is to display an object which is the subject of a \u2018broken relationship\u2019 and tell the story behind it. Some are funny, some poignant, some extremely sad. The stories come from across the world so there isn't any particular Croatian emphasis. There",
          "This is a great place to stop by on a rainy day! Some funny, some emotional and some interesting relationships stories! Cost is 40 kn which was about $6.",
          "After you have seen everything in Zagreb, you might pay a visit to this museum. Nothing special for all w\u015fth broken hearts.",
          "It's well put on but I think I couldn't relate too much so it all seemed a bit pointless. It's also quite short.",
          "Interesting and unique museum to visit! Go read about the stories of the different couples and break up! Just pop up and purchase a ticket to enter! There's no need to reserve. The museum is located in upper town and it cost 40kn for adult. There are translation in many",
          "Found this museum during walking tour of old town. Interesting concept for a museum. Didn\u2019t know it all started here because now it\u2019s a franchise business. A place for broken up couples to display pre-loved items. Worth a visit to see quirky stuff.",
          "A fun idea in principle, but in reality was either sad, gross or whiny. The bistro attached however is awesome",
          "This is not a place to glance at the artifacts and then go on to the next attraction. The artifacts are commonplace, e.g., a bike, photos, a wedding dress. But the accounts by the people who donated them are engaging. Upon entering the museum one sees people reading the",
          "Small, great location, very interesting and poignant. I was worried that it would be depressing but it covered a wide variety of how a relationship can be 'broken'. The short explanations next to each item were captivating. Had me thinking back to my own relationships over time.",
          "I was there in may 2018. You can spend an hour or so watching all the objects linked to the stories that are told. Stories of broken relationships.",
          "This museum was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen! Easily spent 2 hours reading everything here. The submissions and their write ups will make you laugh and cry and there\u2019s a piece for everyone to resonate with. A must see if you\u2019re in Zagreb\u2019s centre!",
          "I was touched by the exhibition so that was a very emotional visit to me, but I would recommend it to everyone.",
          "Good museum and walking through the exhibits helps to reflect the frailty of relationships. Lots of the exhibits also shows that it brings closure to their broken relationships. Treasure the relationships one have!",
          "This was very unique and interesting. I knew from the first time I heard of it that it was right up my alley, but my travel partner was apprehensive. It turned out that even he quite enjoyed it. It really makes you think about your past and current relationships in your life.",
          "If you have some time to spare while roaming Zagreb, this is a worthwhile stop to make. Very interesting stories shared, and a decent shop with cool items to buy, for yourself or for gifts.",
          "People are in tears about so many sad stories. I felt better as soon as I could get out. When in need of a Depression go there",
          "Great way to spend a few hours on a wet day. 40kn entry fee. Yes there are some items pertaining to romantic break ups, and every item has a story to tell. Some will make you laugh, and others will tear at your heart strings. The wedding dress that was never worn, the letter",
          "This museum, the only one of its kind as far as I know, displays artifacts of broken relationships. They are sorted by why it happened -- some were caused by breakups, some by unexpected deaths, some by war. It's not very big, but it's thought-provoking, and some of the breakup",
          "We enjoyed our visit. The exhibits involve a lot of reading to understand the context and meaning of the objects on display - the stories are the point of the exhibition, not the objects themselves.",
          "This museum is well set out and interesting. I was sceptical before I visited but found it really good fun and worth a visit.",
          "First time visitor. Wife heard about this relatively new museum in Los Angeles..........this is the original. (The one in LA is closed and looking for a new site.) Interesting place. A lot of different stories of relationships and subsequent break ups. After a while I had",
          "I was so not prepared for this! At first it seemed very boring, and I was certain I wouldn't like it. But once I started reading a couple of the short stories, explaining the exhibited objects role in the broken relationship - I really got into it. A very cool and unique museum,",
          "The stories were really interesting and concept is really cool. Good place to spend your time if you are in Zagreb.",
          "Utterly boring. Don't waste your time and money. There are much better attractions in this beautiful city.",
          "Poignant and touching museum full of stories of human experiences which many can relate to. It is a collection of artifacts to which people have ascribed a value beyond the financial. A catalogue of the rainbow of emotions that form the spectrum of life. This is a wonderful way",
          "An intriguing visit to this museum up in the old town. Curated with leftover objects from relationships & history of the background beside each exhibit. Truly engaging.",
          "Very unique and inspires many emotions, very much worth it. It's a small museum so can do it an hour.",
          "This is a fun, off-beat place that highlights the trials & tribulations of love relationships with little vignettes and tokens. It is a fun 40 minute experience and moderately priced at 40 Kn each. If you are stretched for time, you may wish to pass on this opportunity.",
          "Actually a museum about human relationships, or, more appropriately,broken relationships. Not only by one desire, but due to death as well as involuntarily. Beautiful. Touchable.",
          "This a tremendously fun museum that takes 1-2 his to get through and you are going to want to read every single display. It is well worth 40 Kuna.",
          "We both loved this museum, which is based on everyday items, with a story, donated by people. The idea is that giving something away helps bring closure to a break up. All the items and back stories on display were donated by individuals as a kind of catharsis. Some of the",
          "This museum sounded interesting and worth a visit in its name alone. It is not huge or a typical museum, but it is one of the best exhibits I have been to. I read every story which took an hour or so, some were quite witty and some really sad. It was not crowded and very",
          "I have never visited anything Like this before. Concept is very interesting and offers a fresh view on topic of relationships. It is few minutes away from town centre and i would highly recommend visiting.",
          "On a rainy day we headed to the Museum of Broken Relationships. Completely different from your typical museums, we were completely drawn in as soon as we entered! It\u2019s not just about human relationships, which were were sometimes funny or tragic. But also people\u2019s relationships",
          "For 40hrk each we were able to enjoy this cute museum full of items that's symbolise different types of relationships. Broken hearts, broken families, wishful passions... It takes about an hour to visit. Some items come with a funny story while others are deep and sour, so be",
          "Visited from the outside while on tour, this is the museum devoted to broken relationships and gets a mention and pass by from the tour guide.",

          "I was walking around the downtown and noticed a lot of museum around that place . The directions to reach this museum is very clear from the city centre. The Museum seems to be on hill top , its a neat one with collection of articles from around the world of broken relationship",
          "Sadly the stories anf mementos here can fill the scripts of 1000 tearful soap operas. The patrons are sad, the stories are sad; if you are sad and the weather is miserable there is no better way to achieve total depression. I am mot sad but I do get lonely from time to time -",
          "Nicely presented, quirky, all the displays are in English. Probably the most popular Museum in Zagreb. I do not think I have been in a museum where all the visitors read all the write-ups! And the cafe was nice afterwards too.",
          "As a family law attorney and Divorce coach I had to see this museum but my DH and friends also found it fascinating. Some stories are funny, others sad. Different relationships highlighted, parent/child, couples, etc. Allot 1 hour. Worth the price of admission.",
          "Go if you have spare 40 kunas to give away. I have never visited an exhibition with such a theme and decided to part with my money. There were quite a number of exhibits. I left the museum with relief after failing to find my girlfriends\u2019 items being exhibited.",
          "Interesting if you want to look into people\u2019s broken hearts and see the stuff that\u201d made it real\u201d. The cafe is too",
          "Artifacts associated with a broken relationship together with an associated story. The stories run the gamut of bust ups of all kinds. Some funny, others poignant, others a bit dull., others surprising, some shocking. So glad we made the effort.",
          "The museum sounds nicer than it actually is, some objects have their story\u2019s poorly explained... but still, its very interesting, fun (and sometimes sad), and unique. It\u2019s worth it if you have one or two hours to spare. Also the tickets are not too expensive (30 kunas)",
          "We liked going through the exhibits, reading the stories behind the objects and getting touched by the words and people. It is a very special thing not like any other museum. I would recommend going there.",
          "A unique museum, to be visit! It takes an hour, and you will experience something new. It might be a bit crowd, and since it is not big, that will might influence in bad way your expreince. So let's try to find the right moment to visit it",
          "I have always enjoyed this Museum's central concept as well as the particular compact exhibition space spread artfully over several rooms. It was as lively as ever during my latest visit but featured some new material.",
          "This is an art museum that presents artifacts of broken relationships with accompanying narratives that help one see the common themes in loss and grief that unite all human beings. Far from being depressing, this is a unique, memorable, heart-warming, humorous and inspiring",
          "We liked this museum very much. The stories were sad, funny and sometimes very heartbroken. For sure worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely amazing, I have never seen anything similar before. Each artefact has a meaningful and interesting story and can make you think a lot about your life.",
          "Among the seemingly hundreds of Museums in Zagreb this is a little gem with a very lovely concept (pun intended)",
          "A gem! Didn\u2019t know what to expect from this museum but after visiting a boring historical museum up the road, we found this one to be the light hearted lift we needed. Some hilarious stories, told with sensitivity and honesty. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Museum of broken relationships is really special and it\u2019s not like other museums. It\u2019s full of both sad and happy love stories from all over the world. I\u2019ll recommend everyone to visit it, it\u2019s kind of unique one :)",
          "You\u2019ll read and see such tragic tales of lost love, but also strange and fun stories that are way out there and some you can relate to. If you have a couple hours, give it a try!",
          "The idea of museum is unusual , basically they showed different relationship stories from various countries within different age range. Each described story was dedicated to particular item, which presented in the museum. Some stories are really exciting. I would recommend to",
          "The displays and stories will make you laugh and make you cry. Remnants of relationships that ended, some humorous some tragic An example of my own that of course is not in the museum I once fell hard for a guy that later loaned me a jacket to go camping ( a trip that he was",

          "An interesting and sometimes funny, sometimes sad place to visit. Beautifully set out. You need to spend some time there as there's a lot to read. Well worth a visit!",
          "A fun unique visit, glad I stopped in. Its for the creative mind and lover of weird, good stories. It\u2019s definitely small and not something to spend your whole day on but glad I went!",
          "Such a bizarre concept but it works! Apparently the most visited museum in the whole of Croatia but receives no state funding. Some of the exhibits are expectably sad, but some are uplifting. Really worth visiting just for how unusual it is.",
          "It\u2019s an interesting museum. Everything has its own story. I think some of them are really touching! Worth to take it a look! It doesn\u2019t cost too much and won\u2019t spend too much time!",

          "... for teens. I was not so impressed, but my kids were very happy to explore all those broken hearts.",

          "It is very interesting place and on good location but it would be better If they have more content. But I recommend it :)",
          "This was a unique and at times moving experience reading about broken relationships and seeing the objects that represented the break up to them.",
          "We have all had relationship losses - friends, family. The artifacts and stories provided windows into people\u2019s experiences and emotions worldwide. A reminder that love is universal. Highly recommended.",
          "I am a museum junkie and this museum was so very different from the places I ususally visit. Each of the artifacts told a different story of loss. Some funny, some sad, some that just made you say \"Wow.\" Each story, each artifact was contributed by someone who experienced the",
          "One minute I was laughing the next I was crying. It's an incredible museum and a highlight in Zagreb.",
          "The premise isn\u2019t promising but they define broken relationships broadly so it\u2019s varied. This was one of my favorite things in Zagreb-quirky and left a lasting impression.",
          "Very unique museum, and especially interesting if you go with a romantic partner! Many types of broken relationships are portrayed, not just romantic. Some stories are humorous, others dark. It's a place that makes you think about the people in your life. Just wish there had",
          "The museum is small but quirky, beautiful and unique. Features items all across the world with art work that shows exactly how far across the world this movement has spread and how far items have come to be donated. Definitely worth a look when in Zagreb!",

          "First thought was that it wouldn\u2019t be much fun but it\u2019s the opposite. The exhibits are fun, thought provoking and sometimes sad It will make you think and it\u2019s is thoroughly worth while. Overall it was very enjoyable and I recommit without reservation",
          "I went here at the suggestion of my friend and didn't know what to expect at first. However, once I got into these real people's real stories, I found myself really enjoying my time there thinking about my own past and present relationships. There were stories that made me get",

          "Objects tell a story, that is the heart of what any museum should be about and is core to the Museum of Broken Relationships. There are a host of different items on display, from toys and wedding dresses to dildos and letters, each of which tells its own tale of heartache and",
          "It's a very nice idea to dedicate a museum for broken relationships. It's not only about lovers but all sort of relationships. Collections change as they receive new items. You wil go through all sort of of emotions, some quotes are funny, some are sad others weird or even",
          "An unusual museum, but definitely worth a visit. It\u2019s definitely been a highlight of my trip, and one of the most interesting museums I\u2019ve ever been to. A mix of happy, sad, funny, tragic, and freeing stories. I came out at the end feeling like all the heartbreak I\u2019d ever felt",

          "This is a small museum where you can see objects people have sent from around the world to tell their stories of broken relationships. Some stories are sad, heartbreaking, funny... if you have time to stop and read every story to give the objects a context do pass by - otherwise",
          "Really unique experience. Great idea, great execution! Will entertain you, but also make you think of your own relationships. Must have .. when in Zagreb. Nicely situated in the Old Town, on your sighseeing route.",
          "Plan a bay of being good to yourself after.. the place itself is amazing. You see the good and the bad side of relationships.",
          "A fascinating insight into human relationships and how they can break down. This is a raw exhibition of some very sad stories that remind you that everyone is human",
          "Zagreb is filled with such awesome historic stuff - this was amazing to do something a little different. If you have a big heart or even if you enjoy a good laugh or having a peak into the lives of someone else you will love it here! Was oddly romantic. Definitely worth the",

          "This museum is very different and is a fun city activity - it is based on items and stories which people have sent in and explained about their relationships with a wide variety of love stories and more family orientated stories. It is a short walk from the centre of Zagreb and",
          "It s an idea everyone can relate to. It s a museum of basic human emotions love loss sadness and finally,moving on. For every age and all nations.",
          "The museum is interesting, I like the fact that people sent items from their lives and shared their stories. However I think that the items could have been more and also not all the stories were interesting. The idea is nice and the storytelling makes the museum interesting and",
          "Amazing place, unpretentious and warm. I didn\u2019t expect t to be so cute! Definitely worth seeing! I highly recommend it!",
          "On Catherine's Square you find the Museum of Broken Relationships. I have been told it is a unique museum but sadly it was closed.",
          "This museum is definitely unique! It consists of memories from broken relationships. Not just couples, but also family etc. The museum will make you laugh and feel sad. There is a lot of reading but it is set up very well so multiple people can read at the same time. You do",
          "Hearing the name of this museum, we had to check it out. It was interesting to read all the various stories, some sad, some funny. It was not what I expected - I had thought it would be more visually appealing. But definitely somethimg to do if you have some free time. We",
          "Interesting and original place. I wouldn\u2019t ruin the surprise for understanding the Broken Relationship Museum purpose. Just go there and enjoy the stories!",
          "Wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from this museum, but we spent way longer than anticipated, as reading the stories attached to the items became addictive. Some sad, moving, bitter, amusing but always interesting.",
          "Quirky little museum, well laid out and worth a visit. It won't take more than an hour of your time so step inside for some amusing and sad stories.",
          "It is a cool place to visit but not for the weak hearted human being. There are stories that can put a smile on your face but the majority of it may leave you a bit depressed. There are a lot of sad stories that did not end well for the wrong reason. There was one about a case",
          "I was not so keen to visit the museum, but the owner of our accommodation recommended it. It was actually quite interesting to read the story behind each item (some of them were really painful). I wouldn\u2019t say it is a must in Zagreb, but if you have 30 mins to spare maybe you",
          "This museum is a unique concept whereby the contents are provided by the public. It was interesting, heartwarming, funny, sad and historical all at the same time. Well worth a visit.",
          "Cool and different place to visit, some stories are funny in the way they are presented and some are really sad. I went out of the museum thinking how everything depends on a perspective how you look at the things. if you only have 1 day in Zagreb, would definitely recommend as",
          "Intrigued just by the name, I had to check this out on day 1. It's not just about romantic relationships though- covering family, friends and food! A small exhibit, but reading the story behind each memento is so special. It's all about closure, and I could hear \"Thank You,",
          "Great idea, unique! Very interesting, ticket not expensive (5\u20ac). Takes approx.30min. For sure you won't be sorry.",
          "Got to go to this place if in Zagreb. Small but full of emotions of all kinds we loved it. Great idea by the people who decided upon this",
          "It's a really interesting museum, where you can really take your time to read all the descriptions. If you don't read the stories attached to the objects, it doesn't make sense to go to the museum, cause that's the whole point of the museum. It is divided into different topics,",
          "Was not sure what to expect when visiting, but it was surprisingly interesting, funny and times thought provoking. It ranges from items reflecting from the standard relationship break ups, to more deeper \u201cbreak ups\u201d. I think it is the only museum I\u2019ve been to that I\u2019ve read all",
          "It was good. I expected more exhibits but everything you can fond there is so heartwarming. Price is reasonable (students have discounts). You're gonna spend the 1 hour approx. And it's worth it.",
          "Didn't know what to expect, but thought we'd give it a try. It consists of a collection of everyday objects with a story to go with them, that gives the object some significance. There is a wide range of objects and stories, some are funny, some sad and a couple are really quite",
          "I didn't quite know what to expect when my wife said she wanted to go here. But I am glad I did. Very interesting & diverse stories and also very sad.",
          "A museum is interesting, both for adults and children. A place for learning and fun. Excellent offer of souvenirs, though of higher prices. Wish the space is larger, becomes a bit crowded due to number of tourist visits.",
          "Congratulations whose idea to make this project . Mainly women were coming there , it is not interesting for me .",
          "Museum of Broken Relationships was on the itinerary for our holiday to Zagreb. Although a fairly small museum, there were many items displayed with each person's stories on plaques. Some of the items and their stories were very amusing and weird, whereas others were a tribute to",
          "Well displayed interesting articles on display . It\u2019s sometime heartbreaking reading about some cruel break ups and losses. Staff helpful. Students Gervais discount. Well worth the price to visit.",
          "Many pieces on display, some with quite amusing stories, others a bit more sad/ depressing. We spent about half an hour or so there, an alternative evening activity if you have nothing else to do as it's open til later than other places.",
          "Well when you are in Zagreb ,one of main attractions except main squers and buildings is this place. Really good to spend some time and see some interesting things. I reccomend if you have time, you will have fun",
          "It is a good idea, there are so many interesting love stories told with artefacts from toys to used heroin needles.",
          "This is a relatively large flat converted to a museum having collections of ordinary stories who have left something or went through an every day life story of separation or death including some teen age stories.and a wedding dress of a lady whose husband passed our just a day",
          "This place is super cool, the stories are very personal and eye opening. Some are sad, some are happy and some are funny and all are interesting.",
          "Lots of fun & heart warming sentiments from around the globe. It is a good place to reflect on those things we all have in common. Well worth a walk through.",
          "The museum is not that impressive. It is small. Pieces aren't remarkable. Simply, it is a \"different\" type of museum which is slightly amusing.",
          "Alternative museums have been a quest of mine throughout my European trip, so when I stumbled across this one, I was very intrigued. The museum hosts a number of quirky and personal items, all with a history of their own. The museum showcases the stories of broken down lovers,",
          "The exhibition is very impressive indeed. I love the parts where you can know different cultures and all kind of romantic/heart-breaking stories in the museum.",
          "The museum isn't very big, but I thought the exhibition was nicely presented. The idea - writing about broken relationships from all over the globe and showing their \"artifacts\" - is quite quirky. I recommend it to anyone who's tired of seeing yet another museum of art.",
          "The concept of this museum is innovative and very well implemented. They have different stuff from broken relationships. It's a must visit in Zagreb and highly recommended. They have a very good coffee shop in the museum.",
          "Displays of shocking and emotive stories of relationship breakdowns and disasters. Cases forwarded from public, internationally. A little lower ground building. Compact. Even has souvenirs. Recommend it to anyone.",
          "An usual museum filled up with stories and objects of people who broke up for one reason or another. All stories are worth reading. Some are very sad, luckily there are also enough funny stories to counter it. Well worth visiting. Entrance is 40 Kuna",
          "Very fresh and original idea for a museum. One of the must places to go when in Zagreb. Especially with your spous or partner.",
          "The museum is really one of a kind.I spent more than two hours there and it left me speechless. The museum is full of items that people sent to the museum that reminds them of past relationships. I laughed alot but some stories were very tragic tho.",
          "This was obviously on our list of things to do in Zagreb! It strikes a great balance between sad, funny, arty, even rude!!! A great concept to tell the story of a relationship with one object. Thought provoking about how you would personally record your own relationships-and",
          "Went with my boyfriend. Actually his idea to go. I didn't know what to expect, and it turned out a unique experience. Not only broken loves, also beautiful and sad stories. All personal donations, toys, cds, clothes. Lovers, parent-children. It's a museum to moan the lost",
          "A small but poignant place to spend an hour. If you\u2019ve ever loved and lost, you will feel it there. And if you\u2019re feeling it too much, the museum cafe serves alcohol ;)",
          "Not a must if you dont't have an hour to spare. Only a few exhibits were interesting. Nothing very special.",
          "WE spent a long time there, attempting grasp any kind of positive feeling from this place. Did not happen. Will never go there again. Why the hell this place exists is totally beyond me.",
          "I think I was expecting more humor; what you get are lots of mementoes with stories that illuminate their importance to someone's life. Some stories quite emotional. It only takes an hour or so to see the whole thing, but it's a worthwhile visit.",
          "A little bit off the wall for my taste but interesting concept. Good way to pass a dreary day in Zagreb",
          "Located in the old town near St Mark's Church. It has a small fee to visit. It takes 1 - 1.5 hours to do fully. I would recommend this if you like to see a different type of Museum. I found myself relating to some of the stories about relationship break ups, gasping in shock",
          "My husband wasn't wild about visiting this site, because he suspected it would be \"A downer.\" I guess sadness was to be expected. I thought the range of effects, which were tied with people's tragic lives, was the most interesting and unusual aspect of this museum. There were",
          "I wouldn't recommend this museum, it was nothing special. Some of the stories were way too long and/or plain boring. Others were so heartbreaking, I couldn't stop thinking about them for days... Some were worth it, but overall, I definitely wouldn't say it's a must visit.",
          "Impossible to tell how many of the 'stories' are true or made up. Maybe if they'd all been made up it'd be more interesting.",
          "We read a lot of recommendations about the place but were quite disappointed, most of the exhibits were accompanied by an explanation that was too long for our taste",
          "Well worth spending an hour here. Remarkable stories. Totally different to any other museum I have visited. Only costs 40 Kn. Money well spent if you\u2019re looking for a different experience and will move you.",
          "This is probably on the most unique museums we have been to. It was so different. It want nicely presented even if the subject was depressing. The only negative thing is that it is very popular so it takes a while to go through everything.",
          "We have never been to a museum like this before and as such, our expectations were quite low. However it was surprisingly insightful and very moving. An inexpensive way to appreciate a different kind of museum. Take time afterwards and enjoying the amazing coffee in their caf\u00e9.",
          "We aren\u2019t really museum people but this one really appealed to us. It\u2019s only 40k entry. You go for all the stories. I\u2019d recommend it. They need to work on the loo though which had no lock.",
          "This is so different and unique. I have never seen this in all my travels. A lot of thought provocation. A must see.",
          "Not your average Museum, definitely worth spending and hour here. You\u2019ll smile, maybe shed a tear, all real life stories",
          "This museum is something different and you may find items that remind you on present ore past relationship and give you window in intimacy of unknown couples. Showing how small item may be important in intimacy.",
          "An interesting idea that spiraled out of control to whining and moaning self pity at best. Many were just plain hatefilled. Get over yourself.",
          "unique concept. small but very popular museum with some interesting stories. can comfortably spend an hour or two here. students get discounts (upon presenting student card). there is a small adjoining cafe too.",
          "We did not go in but visited the attached coffee shop for a beer and wine as it was very hot. Excellent service by friendly staff who also offered feee wifi. Cheers.",
          "I came in hoping to see more art displays, but found that it was a lot of reading displays. There were displays, and each artifact had a few paragraph stories to read.",
          "Beautiful exhibition but the museum needs to be mindful of its patrons and add content warnings as several of the stories are about suicide, rape or parental abuse.",
          "I was very excited to visit this museum, and it was exactly as advertised yet I was still disappointed. They do a good job of grouping items into categories based on the relationship type. For example, parent-child relationship, divorce, first love, etc... some of the stories",
          "Some sad stories, some interesting stories, and a few somewhat shocking stories. Like I said, worth a few hours of your time. My thirteen year old wanted to read every story associated with the items depicted ... luckily only a few were for an older audience.",
          "This is a great museum. Small, easy to navigate. Unusual concept but seems to fit the city vibe. Folks from around the world donate items that remind them of a break up, lost love or...some are super sad, some humorous.",
          "Not as maudlin as it sounds. Stories surrounding an object that shows how a broken relationship affected the life following the breakup. Not too much to see, but enough of different types to see.",
          "The idea of this museum intrigued me. Some of the stories were funny and some extremely moving, but it is really just a collection of odd items. Ok, but nothing special. The gift shop was good.",
          "just some not so creative broken heart romantic stories here. nothing dramatic. if you are a serious museum lover looking for new information or experience, avoid this tourist crap",
          "It was like reading a never ending story about love and life. It was real, not an every day experience and I liked it. Maybe it was me, but I really felt it and it was emotional journey for me, not a tipical museum visit. Thanks is all I can say.\ud83d\ude0a",
          "This is definitely my favourite museum because of its originality. The objects exposed there often can seem totally insignificant at first glance, but they represent a symbol of a (broken) relationship, that is not only sentimental one, but also a relationship of child-parent,",
          "That place is cool... it\u2019s funny and a lot of the stories are amusing. Extra funny if you go with your other half.",
          "Both interesting, unique and sad. Well worth a visit, take the time to read all the stories. Great coffee in the cafe.",
          "A funny way to spent 20 minutes if it rains. Maybe a little bit to expensive for what it is but nonetheless interesting.",
          "Unique experience at the lovely Zagreb uptown. I loved it. Give it some time and explore this great idea yourself.",
          "It's based on a nice idea, but it is not a must-see in Zagreb. The pieces in the exhibition are arbitrary and the stories mostly rather pointless. I was ready within about 40 minutes with some smiles on my face, but no real new knowledge.",
          "It was interesting but I think there is so much more they could do with it. Worth a visit. The venicular ride to the top where it is situated is quite novel. It\u2019s basically a bunch of things people have donated from a meaningful part of a previous or current relationship - some",
          "My wife wanted to see this so I said sure. She was luke warm after our visit; I didn\u2019t last the entire exhibit. Too much pain, hurt and anger expressed in relationships that didn\u2019t work out.",
          "Such a different experience to go to a exhibit like this. It totally sounds weird, I know, but it's interesting to read about people's life and how they deal with it. Plus, it a cool thing to do during the night since a lot of other museums close early, and this one is open",
          "I really enjoyed this museum, it was so very different from any other places to visit! I am not so touristy so stumbling on this was fresh and new & recently coming out of a long relationship- I could relate!",
          "The reason I didn't say waste of time, is because I walked out after 3 minutes. There are two 50 or so stories of failed relationships. WHO CARES!!! Read a tabloid instead.",
          "It was an entertaining stop and a unique concept for a museum. It is very close to St. Mark's Church and the cannonball firing at noon so it's not out of the way.",
          "This is one of my favorite museum in Zagreb. It has really nice stories next to every object. Some of them are very funny but some will make you cry. I really enjoy it :)",
          "I went because I thought it might be fun but it was pretty poor really. Too small and not that funny. Save your time and money.",
          "This museum is very unique because it lists down exhibits\u2014- that are a part of some broken relationship in the past(affairs, divorces, parent-child). It is beautiful ..... a very different concept ....",
          "The most personal museum I've ever visited - a series of individuals relating their stories about break-ups of every kind, along with a totemic item as illustration. Funny, sad, heartbreaking - unlike anything I've seen before.",
          "This is one of my favourite museums of all time. Reading about other people\u2019s dysfunctional relationships made me feel a whole lot better about my own dysfunctional relationships. The range of emotions was unexpected. Five stars from me.",
          "This visit was more for my wife than it was for me. I did enjoy reading some of the stories but overall not my taste. Glad my wife enjoyed it. For 40kuna per person, it was a nice quick stop and a recommended destination in the old city.",
          "Although I had seen a lot of youtube videos about this museum, I decided to see its exhibits myself. I paid 30 krunas for my entrance fee. I initially thought that broken relationships involve only lovers and husbands/ wives. It also includes broken FAMILY relationships.",
          "Amusing in a sad kind of way. Modest admission fee so worth a stop for 30 minutes or so. Could have stayed a bit longer but it was too warm in the museum. Lots of reading of stories so don\u2019t forget your glasses!",
          "Randomly found out about this museum while I was figuring out some routes on google maps prior to the trip. Thought it was interesting and added to my to-go list. I\u2019m glad I visited! Great way to spend an evening or a rainy day. It\u2019s always nice to read stories of others and",
          "You can get a student discount which is handy. Very interesting museum and definitely worth a visit. You can also contribute in a book by writing something yourself :) It\u2019s close to a few other attractions too!",
          "I love the concept of this museum and they have a poignant collection of stories of love, loss, and everything in between. Some will make you laugh, others cry, sometimes both. It\u2019s well worth a trip if you\u2019re in Zagreb.",
          "I was with a group of 8 people. Half liked the experience; the other half thought is was mediocre, at best. There are quite a few novels that portray the concept in a much more moving and less expensive fashion. Good to visit on a Sunday / Monday when other places could be",
          "My wife and I visited this museum today. The exhibits are a great reflection on the human emotional experience related to the end of relationships. Amazing variety of stories.",
          "We came because we thought it was a bit of a weird museum we had never heard of. Firstly it was supposed to be for a laugh but some of the stories are so sad! Especially one about a girl who had been raped.... a few light hearted and funny ones too though. If you have extra time",
          "Concept is good and different stories from different people not only lovers but parent's as well but not too great.",
          "The original one is in LA, Zagreb is the second one. This is a nice concept but essentially you are just seeing displays and stories of broken relationships of others - not much outtake otherwise. Everyone goes through heartbreak, your story can easily be featured on there.",
          "This is a quirky little museum, well worth your time. As soon as I read about this place, I was intrigued and had to visit. The museum displays object from broken relationships be it lovers or parent/child etc. and tells the story of the object and how it related to the broken",
          "To those who has been in that phase of breakups, here's the place to feel that you are not alone in this cruel world of bad relationships. The store really has some cool souvenirs to those who enjoy gifts with a humour for breakups. The price to enter the museum is around 30",
          "A truly unique experience with each exhibit engaging and heart-breaking. Some tales were dark, others humorous but all will leave you questioning whether any relationship is destined to succeed. The museum is open late in the evenings, so I would recommend going there later to",
          "This museum brings back painful memories but also reminds you how resilient we are. A bit crowded but easy to get through in under an hour.",
          "Located at the top of the funicular, this museum is where the lovelorn find a home for their sentimental keepsakes. It is located between 2 churches (St Marks and St Catherines), allowing many relationships to come full circle. There are many more keepsakes and stories than",
          "At around $8 Canadian I guess this is decent value. It's kind of a piece of performance art. Not uplifting though!!",
          "This iis museum is a must see. It is unique. It is interesting. Visiting it is a great fun but also quite moving. Beautiful stories and beutiful experience.",
          "Wasn\u2019t too sure about visiting this Museum but even my husband enjoyed it. I found many of the stories very moving, it is very unusual. Only recommendation we would have was if the writing was slightly larger more people could read the same story at the same time when it is",
          "Perfect Zagreb activity. I had seen the touring exhibition before and loved it. This did not disappoint.",
          "The museum shows dozens of objects related to relationships after they are finished. Some stories are funny, other very sad. This was a traveling exhibition before they opened the museum so there are pieces from around the world.",
          "a wonderful museum: displayed simply and in an engaging way, interesting objects and stories, reasonably priced. Definitely worth a visit - just be ready for all it will make you feel. :)",
          "Great idea how to attract tourists from all over the world with interesting true stories even from croatian political reality and beautiful art",
          "Quirky museum. Worth a visit, only takes about 20 minutes to go round. Some funny gifts available in the shop.",
          "Very cool and interesting! A lot of stories are sad but I would still recommend visiting.. You can also buy some funny souvenirs at the entrance",
          "We stumbled upon this while exploring the city and found it to be an entertaining little stop formed out of a creative and all-encompassing idea. Everyone at some time, somewhere has had a relationship end. My wife wanted to know if they had a 'waiting list'...",
          "personally it appeared that the people who presented and wrote about their exhibits lived a sad life but I do have to say that it was different and left me feeling good with myself when I left",
          "We decided to pop in here whilst doing a walk around the upper town. The museum is small, quirky, weird but also different and unique. I got a bit fedup with having to read lengthy stories, some of which were dull or pointless but equally done were sad, poignant or funny. Items",
          "I said this is a \"must see\" as I doubt there is another one in the world. It is interesting to read some of the stories of broken relationships. It starts off slightly humorous, but does get sad in some parts. Very interesting idea for a museum",
          "Love. Who hasn't been in love. And then disapointed about it! The museum is the best idea I have seen in a while. The place is well put together and it has its own souvenir shop. Some stories will absulutley break your heart. Some will leave you asking \"why\". Some will leave",
          "The space is beautifully designed to give a calm and almost serene feel to the museum. Many of the stories behind the objects on display are very moving and sad. But there are also many stories of empowerment and forgiveness and understanding so it is not as heavy going as it",
          "Different from any museum I have ever seen. Items on display were from different relationships that have ended. Very amusing anecdotes on each item.",
          "This is something unique and I guess worth seeing if you have some spare time in Zagreb. It is depressing but in a funny way to see people leaving trinkets and things from their broken hearts. Cool installations.",
          "This was quite packed when I went, which sort of put a damper on the experience at first, but it was still time well spent. The stories are diverse and mostly interesting. Some we're very sad, others funny, some wistful, but all combined to create a special experience.",
          "A very unique museum. Well planned out with objects from around the world even includes sneaky sound installation to add to the museum experience. The captions for the objects give so much more meaning and the human story. My favourite was the video about an elderly lady and the",
          "The place is inside an old building but inside the museum is newly renovated. The exhibit is well organised and arranged. It features artefacts that represent relationships failures and success with wife, husband, father, family etc. A unique museum seen only here.",
          "This museum was adviced by the car rental. It is small but Funny. The subject itself askes for a light Weight approach and they did. None of the Objects are the same, it's all about the stories which were fun, touching or you could relate to them. Staff was friendly and",
          "This was fun, varied and at times a little moving, but for.me it was mainly, light hearted and amusing. I\u2019ve had my fair/fare share of relationships, but wasn\u2019t asked to offer an exhibit! Perhaps next time!",
          "A fascinating museum and well worth a visit. It contains fascinating objects that relate to people's stories of loss be that a partner, a parent or a friend. It is not morbid though as there is humour. It is unlike anywhere I have been before and I thoroughly recommend it!",
          "One of the few museums I have enjoyed. It talks about people`s emotions rather than just items on display you cannot relate to much . spread across 4-5 rooms, it can be covered in 2 hours and is a must see in Zagreb.",
          "There cannot be another museum like this. The appearance of the museum belies these fascinating stories that are exhibited. Most are sad but some are inspiring.",
          "I really loved this museum. It's just so real and you can feel all the emotions by reading the stories and seeing the objects. It was amazing :)",
          "You may first see this and laugh but it is a well thought out museum that looks at various aspects of broken relationships through objects associated with those relationships. There is even a gift shop and small cafe in the museum.",
          "Must visit if u in Zagreb. 40kronas per person and best part is that they accept cards (not just cash) It might take 30-45 mins to explore the musume. It's very close to upper city and is accessible via cabs. They have a cafe too inside the musume.",
          "It is surely a museum of a different kind and I have not seen or heard of a similar kind anywhere in the world. But what a waste of time.. How is this relevant? Even if someone is going through a similar misfortune , he or she can only feel more miserable. It is a personal",
          "You should make the time to visit this unique museum. Film You should take the time to visit this unique museum. Folk have contributed an item that represents a past relationship that has failed for many varied reasons",
          "The Museum of Broken Relationships is one of those unique ideas that portrays human relationships. It consists of everyday objects - fragments of a love letter, stuffed toys, statuettes, memorabilia and even a suicide letter from a mother - all with stories that break the",
          "I have visited this museum twice, and have found it fascinating, emotional and funny all at once. It is somehow a beautiful reflection of the raw and difficult nature of love and relationships, and features a great selection of objects with the explanation included in the form",
          "You\u2019ve never been to a museum like this before. Intimate stories shared by the broken hearted, a very interesting exhibit, not appropriate for children.",

          "The write up on this museum sounded quirky and unusual, so we thought that would equate to interesting. NOT. The museum displays items and stories of break-ups, which of course you would think is depressing. However, prior research described some of the entries as funny. We",

They all have a brief story that",
          "This is an exhibition of everyday stuff from the last...hmmm maybe 100 years or so. Connected to each item, there is a story about a relationship and its breakup. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes funny, but it is definitely very interesting to see them. There are stories",
          "an interesting idea that becomes a very capitalistic consuming product. Great aidea for stand up comedy but too pricy for a town museum",
          "We found the museum a bit indulgent, sentimental and silly. Schmaltz on steroids. It links narratives (in too small print) with fetish objects from the breakup. Of course, as a museum it\u2019s a one of a kind, and thank goodness for that. Occasionally the exhibits were amusing, but",
          "A fun visit, because the concept is so unusual. For my mature group it was less emotional and more of a curious visit. Our guide rushed us a bit and we couldn't stop at the caf\u00e9 I had heard so much about! ",

You will take 20-30 min, you will pay if I remember well \u20ac8",

Some are funny, some hilarious, and there is a fair share of sad stories about loss.\nDefinitely worth the time if you happen to be in the vicinity, or even after dinner since the place closes fairly late.",

          "There's no doubt that the museum is unique with a genuine idea. The majority of the stories are either painful or just sad. 3 stars were given just because the idea might help \"broken heart\" people via letting them participate and share \u2026",

          "An interesting and unusual museum. I found that I spent all my time reading the stories and not looking at the objects, therefore I might as well have read the book instead. Also there was a parent with a screaming toddler, and that place echos like crazy which made it a less than pleasant visit.",

Each object in the museum has a statement written by the person donating it about what that object had to do with their relationship. Some were funny, some were weird and some were sad. Overall an emotional rollarcoaster worth every penny!",

Really wasn't sure what to expect, but we were really glad to go in. Don't forget to leave a note in their guestbook in the back!",

          "It is a small museum but well worth the price of admission. I spent an hour inside and could have stayed longer. It's edgy and very raw. Loved it!",
          "Interesting exhibits of love lost. Some are poignant and sweet while others are funny or bitter.",
          "Interesting stories... Booklet are available in multiple languages. Just ask the staff for it. (Need to use ur ID as \"deposit\")",
          "The museum is very interesting and unique, the people who work there are also amazing and helpful. Needless to say they speak perfect English.\n\nI broke up with my 4 years of girlfriend just after we went here. It's just a coincidence tho, our relationship wasn't going well either way lol. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n10/10 would go again.",
          "intresting and unique exprience, great way to entertain yourself in different way.\n after your heart is little broken, don't miss out their heartwarming ice-cream",
          "Rollercoastal of emotions but I really liked the exhibit, I would recommend people to try this place if you're in Zagreb",
          "Funny, sad and touching exhibits. Liked the gift shop ideas",
          "A fascinating look at objects and stories from all over the world detailing the end of a relationship. Time needs to be taken to read the stories that go with each object which are filled with a mixture of humour, grief, astonishment and \u2026",
          "The most memorable museum I've ever visited. The stories in here will make you cry, laugh, then cry some more. Such a unique concept, really worth your time.",
          "Excellent museum with very interesting content - not your usual display but heartfelt stories that speak of love and humanity. Must visit.",
          "It's a new idea for a museum which is more of a fun experience rather than the usual knowledge approach of museums.",
          "Excellent idea for a museum. some bizarre, odd, funny and sweet stories. Great range of emotions, from laughter to tears. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Some of the stories were touching. We expected it to be larger with more exhibits. Price was OK.",
          "Exposition in continuous renewal, it has section not just from lovers but other kind of heartbreaks as well! Interesting spot of Zagreb",
          "Great place to see. Lots of stories to read. Some will make you sad, some will make you laugh and some will make you feel touched. Be prepared to spend at least one hour there. There are lots!",
          "Super weird and different. There are some really cool stories and artifacts (some sad ones too). Quite cool to go to if you have the spare time in Zagreb.",
          "Its worth visiting, u get to reflect on life and relationships, authentically nice personell",
          "An interesting concept of a museum where any heart will be touched.\nA bit of sadness, a bit of life wisdom and even humor. The only thing missing, as for me, is air-conditioning.",
          "Very fascinating, reasonably priced, nice place to escape the heat for a while. The attached cafe was also good, and they have some amusing souvenirs for sale",
          "What a wonderful concept. Executed in an interesting way",
          "INSTAGRAM  the.skinny.chick\n\nUnique one in the world. A must while visiting Zagreb, good for males & females! I highly advise to put music on, go alone and really read, take time and feel the stories that way you will feel the whole point of it. Plus it's the coolest souvenir shop I've seen in a museum yet \ud83d\ude01",
          "Initially, I was skeptical of visiting this as I thought it wouldn't that great. However, we happen to pass by this and it was rainning. So, we went in to avoid the rains. I must say, I was glad we went there. Amazing, unique and very interesting experience.",
          "A great idea, a museum of artefacts that capture the pain and sorrow of relationships that have ended. Something different. Poignant. Interesting. A bit depressing.  In a beautiful spot.",
          "I really liked this museum. It's really interesting and fun. Don't skip it",
          "A very interesting, quirky place to visit in Zagreb. Stories of lost loves & broken promises,some were sad, others difficult and some had worked out for the best.\nAll exhibits had been donated by the story tellers. They included a wedding \u2026",
          "Fantastic museum, a must visit when in Zagreb. It would be interesting to see more displays from a greater range of countries, especially those within Asia. There were some great displays from Japan but otherwise Asia was not well represented. We spent about an hour in there and managed to read through all the descriptions.",
          "The museum is definitely an \"out of the ordinary\" place to visit, but beyond that the main take away from this place is that everything is sad. :-( I guess the only good thing is it makes you appreciate the good relationships you do have.",
          "Brilliant , different and cheap. Great change of pace place to visit for those travelling around Europe . Be ready for the waterworks",
          "I don't like visiting museums but this one is absolutely a must! It makes you laugh, it makes you wanna cry, it brings so many emotions.",
          "Very interesting insight into the lives of couples over the world. Also some interesting non-romantic relationships are also portrayed. Cafe looks cozy. Gift shop is reasonably priced.",
          "It's really a one of kind museum,  it's worth to see, because it's unique. You can find objects,  letters and memorabilia for broken relationships.",
          "Fascinating collection of ordinary and less ordinary lives. Some clearly still lost in pain. Well worth a visit",
          "Very interesting place. Invokes some weird emotions. Worth a visit. Takes an hour to read all of the stories.",
          "Enjoyed it and the concept is amazing. Probably it\u2019s too much reading and the owners should consider including more audiovisual material as from one point on it gets too tiring to read read read. Also would suggest a rating system so visitors can vote for the stories so the museum has only good ones.",
          "A surprisingly interesting museum. Loads of funny or touching stories relating to the end of people's relationships. A recommended visit.",
          "Great museum with some great stories. It has a wonderful collection of romantic/sad and funny memories",
          "This a tremendously fun museum that takes 1-2 his to get through and you are going to want to read every single display. It is well worth 40 Kuna.",
          "Found it very interesting and unique.",
          "Amusing yet touching stories shared by the broken hearted. Well worth a visit.",
          "Interesting. Nice souvenir shop. Open in the evening as well, not till 1 a.m. like many museums.",
          "Loved the place. Lot's of interesting stories surrounding the displayed memorabilia.",
          "Hands down one of the best museum I've ever visited in my life! It's an interesting contrast to normal museums where only the bigger picture of history/art/politics/whatever is depicted. In the museum of broken Relationships however you're \u2026",
          "Fantastic must see just like everyone will tell you. The most emotional rollercoaster of a museum or even modern art exhibit that I've ever been to. Many of the items/stories reminded me of where I'd been, many others of situations I'd never considered possible, and some certainly not very ethical.",
          "A very interesting museum that u must go during the visit. Staff was really kind and helpful:)",
          "A real museum .. worth visiting... every item holds a story",
          "Very interesting and full of amazing stories",
          "Cute museum. Different from other museums. Lots of stories to read.",
          "Not worth. There was nothing to see. However, while walking to a museum, we ended up stopping at a place near to museum and a multi day new year event was happening. That was great and also a great location to view sunset",
          "Really unique concept museum. So many stories of heartache, saying goodbye, and parting with a loved one. Really personal artifacts fill the small space with quotes or stories from each donor. Essentially a crowd-sourced museum. Worth the cost of admission. Takes less than an hour to do.",
          "Hilarious and heart breaking! Great staff, a really interesting exhibit, and funny gift shop.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in Zagreb.",
          "Very funny museum.. if you find the time, go for it! But be aware that you don\u2019t break up inside.",
          "Lots of sad stories of break ups, they should also have some exhibits for relationships that survived. But the place is good and entry is free with the Zagreb card. Even if you have to buy the tickets it is not a bad option. Zagreb has a \u2026",
          "Before entering, my expectations weren't high. Not knowing anything about it, I cynically assumed it might be a tourist trap and sounded a bit gimmicky. But I was so very wrong!! \n\nThis was one of the best museums I have been to. It is \u2026",
          "I asked my hostel staff what the best Museum was and they recommended this one.\n\nIt had items which were mementos of broken relationships. Funny, sad and interesting descriptions were attached to almost all of them. Some had barely any \u2026",
          "High recommended. Such meaningful stories and a change from typical city museums!",
          "Very emotional and beautiful.  What a fantastic idea. There were tears and laughter.",
          "Too hyped. Not worth a visit",
          "Should be free but it's cool to see",
          "Really interesting and touching stories to go with the objects shared.",
          "This quirky museum is probably one of the main attractions in Zagreb. Like the name indicates, it showcases a number of items and stories that relate to broken relationships (mostly between lovers, but also between family members). Some \u2026",
          "Very interesting concept which will leave you laughing at some times and crying at others. Definitely worth a visit. A real insight into the things that hold sentimental value in a relationship and people's unique views.",
          "Interesting spot in the center of Zagreb, you will find curious and personal stuff related to a previous or broken relation. It takes 40 minutes to complete the museum",
          "Fun place to visit. Very quirky. Does not take long and is low cost.",
          "Really full of emotions, not only Romantic relations are there! Very recomended",
          "A very interesting and different museum, not just about broken romantic relationships.",
          "I am not sure why, but it did not \u201ctouch\u201d me as expected. I believe the idea and concept is great but  poorly executed, presented  and displayed.",
          "Great place to visit and lots of touching stories.",
          "An amazing museum, not just filled with items from romantic relationships but touching things like parents who lose a child too soon. I spent a couple of hours here trying to read every single description and examine every item it was a fantastic experience that I would highly recommend.",
          "Unusual exposition of love stories with deep human touch. The whole style and atmosphere is also fascinating. I recommend!",
          "5 with huge + I'm impressed. I can't compare this museum with other museums... This museum is emotional roller-coaster for me.",
          "Beautifully set out. Very nice staff. Came away feeling a little sad, but also touched by the power of love. A unique and interesting concept.",
          "Fascinating (and occasionally stomach turning) collection of items and stories. Certainly worth a visit and a good way to spend an hour.",
          "This is one of the best gallery I have seen in my life. I laugh, I cried, believe me if you go to Zagreb you have to stop here.",
          "Such a cool idea! Go there. You will laugh, cry and smile again.",
          "Do visit this interesting concept for a museum. Has a small cafe inside. Sip on the memories. Right in the middle of Old town Zagreb.",
          "This was an incredible discovery. Such a beautiful, original idea to put the people, privacy people, back to the middle of the picture.\nA way of giving dignity and relevance to the histories of common people, with their real dramas, pains, \u2026",
          "Not what I expected, but really cool place to visit. Go if you have a chance! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "If you think you had bad breakup with youre ex, you should go there and read about some of the really, really bad breakups people had. You might feel better about your ex lover. x)\nThey are constantly changing the exhibition so you may find out something new every time you go there.",
          "The cafe bar very good. The museum is different .",
          "5 with huge + I'm impressed. I can't compare this museum with other museums... This museum is emotional roller-coaster for me.",
          "Definitely worth it! Name of the museum sound like one of the weird topic... Yep, it's little bit weird to exhibit personal items connected with relationships. The stories are sometimes funny, sometimes emotional, sometimes it remindes you your own experiences... P.S. The souvenir shop sells cool stuff.",
          "It is one of the best museums I have ever visited.\nWhen you come in, it seems that it is small and 30 minutes will be enough to see everything.\nI spent there about 3 hours.\nAll that stories about relationships and how they ended, all that \u2026",
          "Definitely different type of museum",
          "Nice museum but quite small",
          "There are some interesting stories, but there are also several that are quite boring. A few brought a tear to my eye. It only took an hour to get through the whole museum.",
          "There was a few pieces that I enjoyed however this definitely is not a highlight of Zagreb. Wasn't worth visiting.",
          "Exactly what it says on the tin. Worth a visit as some of the stories are hilarious.",
          "I really fell in love with the concept of this museum. The stories were so heart warming.",
          "Interesting idea and interesting content. Some of them humorous and some of them sorrowful; some of them erotic and some of them artistic. You feel different feelings during the tour..",
          "Beautiful museum with funny and emotional life stories",
          "Really great experience, was a bit reserved about what i would find but really enjoyed it.",
          "Great idea transformed into a very meaningful exhibition.\nPeople walks around reading with attention the notes, and it is clear that everybody is really thinking and feeling close to other human beings that tell us their story.\nVery good museum well worth a visit.",
          "Interesting small museum displaying personal items with a story about the relationship and how they were tied in. Funny and sweet and emotional.",
          "Small but a very well curated. An interesting and touching exhebition that is at times heartbreaking and at times hilarious. Worth the visit.",
          "Not bad museum, quite unusual. Recommeded",
          "At times poignant, funny, angry, sad, bitter... Just as you would expect. But what comes through more than anything else is the capacity to and need for love. Really worthwhile visiting. The attached cafe/bar was good value.",
          "Very gorgeous and intriguing art exhibit of a museum. Low priced entry makes it completely worth it even if you spend less than 30 minutes looking at the exhibit.",
          "This is definitely  my favourite museum because of its originality. The objects exposed there often can seem totally insignificant at first glance, but they represent a symbol of a (broken) relationship, that is not only sentimental one, \u2026",
          "Small and a bit packed with people. Interesting exhibition, unique and different. It just gets too cosy especially In the winter. Recommended it, if you are looking for different and exotic museum.",
          "This is one of it's kind and unique museum. You can find stories from all around the world. \nThe concept is unique. Entry fees is not very cheap and not very costly,it's in budget. You must visit in Zagreb. You can find a lot of interesting stories and things.Must visit place.",
          "Very good place to go, you can spend a good momentn reading all the anecdotes, some are fun some are sad, but all of them have to be read, take your time and you will enjoyed",
          "Came here the same day as a wedding - probably not the best way to prep. The display is short and simple, but many of the stories are simply soul crushing.",
          "A super cool concept, and very powerful and meaningful stories. Some are shocking, heartbreaking, empowering. All are touching in their own way. The museum can only show about 10% of its collection at a time, so the exhibits are always \u2026",
          "We have decided not to visit, after all... It takes a little bit of cinicism to go inside. However, the coffee shop of the museum is worth a visit.",
          "Great experience - would definitely recommend!",
          "Super interesting alternative museum. Big plus: dogs are welcome. :)",
          "Very interesting..one of a kind..i wish there would be more entries...",
          "Very nice pieces and stories. However it felt a bit watered down after so many exihibits, nevertheless well worth your money and time.",
          "They have some good collections here (and history). Some of the story are funny, some make you wanna cry, some are really short. The entrance ticket is about 30-40 kuna if I'm not mistaken. It's really worth for someone who likes love story. Can't deny, this museum is one of the most unique museum in the world.",
          "Nice museum, the concept was very different from other museums, highly recommended.",
          "Hilarious and unexpected museum, if you love quirky stories and something a bit left of centre this is for you. Some of the stories were genuinely heartbreaking and others had us in stitches (the toaster!). The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is I would have loved more items in the shop to purchase as a souvenir",
          "Very unique and interesting exhibition.",
          "Interesting and thought provoking",
          "A lot of good stories why ppl choose to leave their loved ones and keep something as memento",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Interesting and quirky relationship stories. Takes an hour or so.",
          "Unique place, you can see it only in Zagreb and i LA.",
          "It is a nice Museum, but I expected more. It is a collection of stories about breakups. Some really sad, some funny. \nYou need to read each history",
          "Small museum, a little depressing if you let it get you down, but I think it is such a unique yet relateable concept for a museum. It feels more like an art installation, all the objects have a bkurb, poem, or story to go along with them so be prepared to read the whole time.",
          "I really enjoyed the visit! It's perfect for a break from the city and it's nice to read people's stories;",
          "Worth a visit. Thought it a strange concept at first but meandering through totally got it.\n\nIt's filled with artefacts that all have a story related to some failed relationship, couples, parents, friends, lovers. \n\nSpent a morning reading \u2026",
          "Stories are in Croatian and English, from all around the world, mostly sad and not all are catchy... it kinda ruined our mood a bit...",
          "Fun if sad at times way to spend a few hours. Good value.",
          "Will interest people who has gone through it. Few of the views are beautiful y described",
          "Initially when I heard about it my (unfounded) impression was that it would be a small museum with just a few show pieces about...broken love relationships (well Duhhhh \ud83e\udd13).\nWellll.....NO! It's prety extensive. It has a lot of items from \u2026",
          "It's quite amusing to look at different stories. But they do charge a good amount of money for the entrance.",
          "It's very different, but I did enjoy it. Good way to spend an hour or so. Nice cafe for a quick drink or bit to eat.",
          "The experience is amazing, you get the range of emotions from laughter to sadness,  but there are stories which gave me shivers, the best part is that it is all real, all of the items there have intimate story.",
          "Really cool concept for a museum and you can tell the exhibitions are crafted with care and respect. A good balance of humour and emotion, definitely worth checking out if you're into something a bit different. Really loved the mix of cultures on display, and the video exhibits were a nice touch.",
          "Are you, or have you ever been, in a relationship? Then you will recognize these tokens of failed relationships, some devastating, others hilarious. I laughed, I cried, I left an even more jaded person.",
          "Quirky little museum that covers all kinds of different broken relationships, not just romantic ones.",
          "Not just a museum over broken relationships but lost relationships, a very unique small museum.",
          "Original museum, i loved the concept!  many moving stories about love, found and lost.",
          "Prepare for lots of reading ;)",
          "Alot of reading but really nice.",
          "This place was amazing!!! At first I didn't expect much from it as I thought this tourists spot is overpriced. Then I realized that the exhibits are really meaningful in many ways ! My friend who is still single could not get much from the \u2026",
          "Interesting and different from every other museums. Mekes you reflect of relations.",
          "Loved the exhibition. I visited the museum twice but there is always something new",
          "This was a really cute, unusual museum with loads of small displays about people\u2019s relationships gone wrong. It\u2019s pretty small but we still ended up staying there over an hour.\nI would recommended caution for some visitors as a number of \u2026",
          "Interesting concept and the feeling is universal. Not sure what my 6 years old thought but he seemed to enjoy looking at an array of stuff.",
          "A very different museum. Amusing at times, sad at times. Definitely off the beaten path of year's museums.",
          "An interesting and engaging idea that unfortunately after a while started being repetitive and uninteresting.",
          "A museum full of tragedy, comedy, and unique stories of people that experienced interesting relationships - all of which were broken and in most cases more than one way. Worth the hike up the hill (or the tram ride) to visit. Like most of the local museums it is an inexpensive experience that is one of a kind.",
          "Its interesting for people who enjoy love stories. Maybe not worth the cost for others.",
          "One of the coolest museums I\u2019ve been in. Really interesting stories and objects, and my favorite place in Zagreb.",
          "This is another great museum in Zagreb! The idea behind this is the experiences of broken relationships and the things we have associated with them. All of the items come from a personal experience and a story for context. One of my favorite museums, can get crowded inside and hot during the summer months but still very fun!",
          "Unique and cool but sad and creepy at the same time so that's why I can't give it 5 stars. Of course is something I recommend to do if you have never visit one like this.",
          "Really worth a visit, hits you hard in the feels! Cheap entry price compared to the experience you get!",
          "So moving!\nContains the artefacts of a wide range of  relationships, from couples, to parent-children relationships, from siblings to long lost lovers.\nA very powerful concoction of emotions, some that leave a sweet after taste and others that leave you feeling bitter.\nA must visit in Zagreb!",
          "A very unique museum!",
          "Really intense, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, always attention grabbing.",
          "Very nicely done museum. Each artifacts has an accompanied story. Some long and some short. Most are pretty quick reads but yes there is a considerable amount of reading but it's necessary to make such mundane things come to life.\n\nSome \u2026",
          "Interesting concept with real life stories.",
          "Not as nice as I thought. Quite boring.",
          "I want my money and four minutes back.",
          "I realize that the name may be off-putting, but this really is a museum not to miss. Superb curation of a unique collection of items. I didn't believe one reviewer that it was the best museum they'd been to...until I went. Tragic, comedic, \u2026",
          "I've traveled all throughout Europe and this is one of the coolest museums I've visited. Unique and a great change of pace if you're looking for something different. Zagreb is a great city and this was one of the highlights of our stay.",
          "Its a different concept for sure. People all over the world have contributed an item with their story. Few were heart breaking and few hilarious and the museum displayed it well.. \nI actually was a bit dissappointed as it was not as good as i had heard..",
          "Interesting concept, it takes around 1 to 1.5 hour to see everything",
          "Very affecting, ingenious museum. A must visit.",
          "One of must see places in Zagreb! So fantastic concept.",
          "Unique and original museum and you will need time for this one in order to read all. And read you will as many of them are outstanding experiences, mostly love couples but also some are the memories of children losing their parents. Museum \u2026",
          "Well worth the visit, poignant, funny, sad, angry stories of loss. Not all of them are marital relationships or even people relationships. Go read the stories",
          "The exhibits are very nicely laid out with little explanations in English and Croatian. Very well thought out little museum. It\u2019s open til 9pm too, which is good. You probably only need an hour or an hour and a half here.",
          "Amazing exhibition, such a cool concept and execution. Highly recommended!",
          "Very different from any museum that you've visited. You can read stories about couples, families and friends, see some items/photos from their relationship, some that had a sad or a tragic ending. As the name suggests it is all about broken \u2026",
          "Offbeat museum commemorating the end of a variety of relationships. Exhibits are explained in Croatian and English, with booklets to accompany in other languages. Students get a discount. Small gift shop. Cafe on site as well. Worth an hour of your time in Zagreb.",
          "This place is so good! It's sweet, sad, hopeful, and funny. It's a must-do in Zagreb!",
          "Really fun",
          "This is the first time that I visited a place like this. Very interesting. An incredible presentation  in a palace . Very lovely",
          "Good place to pass time. Interesting display and stories.",
          "Some stories were funny, some petty but the whole museum makes sense in that way because it might help to let go of some things! :)",
          "Take the time to read. Some stories will make you laugh, some will make you cry... I loved it...",
          "Stories are sometimes fun and sometimes they make you want to cry.",
          "I love the idea behind this museum. The exhibits were interesting and the gift shop has a cool collection of souvenirs. The only downside is that the museum is pretty small and easily gets crowded.",
          "Far more interesting and nuanced than I anticipated.",
          "I teared up more than once, funny, sad, beautiful.",
          "Great place. Makes you a bit nostalgic and thoughtful.",
          "The idea is good. The content is disappointing. Not the best storytelling, nor the most heartbreaking experiences I've heard of. Most things are quite shallow.",
          "The best museum in Zagreb!",
          "A lot of stories. I read almost all of them (except the very long ones and the video knes) and it took us an hour. A very different experience. Stories from a lot of different ages. Entering with a lot of unironic empathy is a must to get \u2026",
          "Some artifacts are nice but most are not great",
          "Many useless things with stories which are sometimes pretty long and boring... the idea though is really nice but if it was SHORT (cause what u do is mostly reading there) funny or angry or creepy stories that would be more interesting.",
          "Well worth the few hours it taken. Very interesting museum. Bring an water bottle as it can be hot and crowded during the summer. Take the time to read everything !",
          "Shokingly good experience",
          "Interesting new concept for me at least, some nice stories but after a while it's just to much....",
          "I've never experienced a museum like this- keep in mind it is close quarters so you need to be patient to read each item description- because it's worth it. I experienced every emotion walking through- which I did with my partner- but \u2026",
          "Cool, unique museum. It's not too big, expect to be done in an hour. Some stories are really moving, and others are really funny. Overall very worthwhile visiting!",
          "After my visit, I can understand why this place is one of the most touristic museums.",
          "Highly suggested, this place is very emotional, worth a visit.",
          "Strongly recommended for every single humain being.",
          "Nice and kind of unique :)",
          "Such a unique place. Loved it :)",
          "This is possibly the best exhibition I\u2019ve been to . Totally unique and surprisingly touching . You absolutely have to go if you\u2019re in Zagreb .",
          "I was a bit worried this might be a bit talked up but thoroughly enjoyed it. The stories were moving and some made you laugh some broke your heart. I highly recommend visiting this museumn if you want something truly unique. It takes about an hour and a half to get through and read everything.",
          "Finally I visited this museum and was impressed with the idea and exhibition. Do recommend. \nAlso gift shop!",
          "Is a interesting place with a lot of articles with own story.",

          "Sad :( But very nice place",
          "I actually liked it, although my friend didn't really seem to and decided to leave shortly after reading the first stories. On the bright side, he said the wifi was extremely fast, so props for that! \ud83d\ude02",
          "I was expecting something else, different, so I was kinda negative surprised about it. There was nothing from pictures that I see on web before I was going in. Price ticket is 40 kuna. Stories was too long and kinda boring for me. Items \u2026",
          "Whirlwind walk through in 45 minutes but heartwarming and funny too. A nice stop and reminder things will be OK",
          "a very meaningful and creative museum \nLots of memories in here.",
          "A lot of personal stories with interesting items on display.",
          "I really like the concept of this place, but I was a bit underwhelmed. Some stories are touching, but in my opinion there are many mediocre ones. In time it will improve, surely, as the 'weaker ones' (though that might be subjective) can make way for new, more interesting stories/objects.",
          "Interesting quirky museum with different types of broken relations categorised by item.",
          "Nice stories but very crowded.",
          "I cried, it was a very effective museum!",
          "Interesting, somewhat funny and sad. I liked it yes.",
          "We've all had a broken heart, so this museum is so relatable. Some stories are funny, some are sad,and seeing the pieces donated, makes it even more interesting.",
          "Small but fun museum",
          "Beautiful, funny and sad at the same time. You should give it a go.",
          "Happening town with enthusiastic Guides",
          "There is a small cafe outside. Perfect for taking a rest after a long stroll up to the Old city. Here you can contemplate every possible meaning of being single near a Museum of Broken relationships. Where was I? Yes. The cafe is nice and quiet.",
          "Well worth visiting. Lots of great stories and displays. About romantic relationships but also families and parents/children.",
          "Absolutely amazing. A good mix of hilarious stories and some sad ones. All of the signs had English translations.",
          "Great, funny and touching museum. Get ready to read all the stories about each object, if you don't want to read don't come.\nThe stories are sometimes beyond understanding...",
          "Interesting place... Some stories felt silly (to me) and some others filled my heart and eyes with tears... I wanted to share my story on the book but I just couldn't let it out... \nA place worth checking...",
          "Super cool idea.  Very crowded which made it difficult to read stories.",
          "Our journey in Zagreb was too short, just two days; and for one of them we spent half of the day in this special exhibition.\nThe only thing that I can day is: visit it. The idea is such absurd ad stunning in the application.\nYou'll be absolutely fascinated.",
          "Very nice museum to visit. So much stories, that it would take many hours to go through if you read all the stories.\n\nI waited for more rough stories, but most of them were quite normal.",
          "Strange museum, worth seeing only if you have spare time in Zagreb.",
          "I don't like,I think gonna be different \nHave a lot stuff people give away \nFor don't remember anymore his ex",
          "Coolest, most unique museum I've ever seen. Very busy though... Bought tickets and had to come back 15 minutes later or more",
          "Amazing and sad ,Art seen in a different way of people\u2019s love stories from heart break to heart healing very worth the visit to see there is still hope out there .",
          "A unique museum. With unique stories told by the broken hearted.",
          "Nice collection of broken relationship artefacts.\nQuite crammed at peak times.\nMake sure to plan enough time for the visit",
          "A unique and interesting museum experience, with pleasant cafe attached and air conditioning (great for the heat of the summer!). Definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re in Zagreb.",
          "I don't know what the fuss is about.  The concept is fresh and interesting but the execution is such that it's just a bunch of notes (and recordings) about people whining about their break ups.  Really?  The cost is rather high too: about \u2026",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. It's just quirky enough without being weird and absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Cool place to go for something different. displays in english and croatian. Some funny stories, some are quite dark. Quite a small place with just a few rooms.",
          "One of the best museums i've ever been to!",
          "Such a wonderful idea, full of touching stories",
          "Been there two times, great museum!",
          "Waste of time... Don't consider in your travel plan",
          "Hilarious, heartbreaking, weird - would highly recommend. Loved reading the guest book comments too :)",
          "Great concept for a museum. Museum is quite small but just enough :)",
          "It was a very lovely and unique museum. We were hoping to hear funny and special brake ups but nearly all of then where depressing and generic. It is a very small museum so be sure or arrive early in the day before the influx of people.",
          "One of the cutest little spots in Zagreb. Such a nice and cool idea for a museum! Yes - completely ordinary everyday objects are exposed. And yes - the stories are not something unheard of. But that is precisely why everyone can relate to \u2026",
          "Interesting and funny stories \ud83d\ude01",
          "This museum offers one thing - stories.\nEvery exhibit is some kind of object with an anecdote/story. Everything is contributed by people who can relate because their heart has been broken in some way.\nThere are some sad ones but also some \u2026",
          "Probably the most unique museum I've ever been to. It'll give you a lot to think about - in a good way. Depending on who you are.",
          "If you are heartbroken or you like drama this is the best place to visit!",
          "Interesting idea, but not so impressive as many people recommended... But fine to visit\ud83d\udc94",
          "Well it's an interesting concept, full of stories of broken relationships ranging from funny to pure morbid. Stories aren't only about couples and span parents to children and a few can get you pretty shaken. I believe there's multiple of \u2026",
          "The Museum of Broken Relationships sounds so dreary, but it truly is a wonderful collection of stories, some that will make you sad, others nostalgic, and some that will even make you bust out laughing.",
          "Loved this museum, one of my highlights",
          "Really enjoyable museum! It's like reading a charming and offbeat book with objects that can be amusingly simple to extremely powerful (such as a mother's suicide note).\n\nWe found that the last room, which has equally interesting stories, \u2026",
          "The entrance fee is very cheap and the experience is very valuable. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll think about some of your relationships that have ended. Maybe you'll wonder what you would send to the museum to be put on display. The room that addresses the parent child relationship is the most moving.",
          "Captivating stories of failed relationships. Small in size which makes the museum easy to digest. A great way to spend an hour.",
          "If You have bad relationship take a look how worse it can be \ud83d\ude42 Good work!",
          "The stories are more interesting than the items",
          "Very interesting, definetly \"must see\"",
          "Full of wonderful stories, crying and laughing all in one visit\nGreat unique museum",
          "Stong & intresting & special",
          "One of my favourite museums in Europe. The collection of objects from broken relationships and stories are equal parts interesting and heartbreaking. Exhibit easily manageable, only taking just over an hour to see it all. Entry fee is super cheap, so definitely a must see.",
          "The space was very nice. The stories were a little odd sometimes, as if the translation to English was a bit off, but it was a fun way to spend an hour! I've never seen anything like it before.",
          "Very interesting museum. Different than the other museums in the sense that the artifacts all have a complete story behind them and they are a very interesting read!",
          "Almost made me cry.  Moving and interesting museum.",
          "Amused by its name and Wikipedia; so paid a visit. Nonetheless good stories of lost love. If you have time and doesn\u2019t get bored by reading relationship stories, then you are at the right place.",
          "Very interesting museum with an unusual theme. Before entering they offer you a book with the translations of the stories of the exhibition. We took Spanish and the translation was pretty bad.",
          "Interesting museumn and nice cafe. Friendly staff. Restrooms inside and student discount.",
          "Amazing place. Tells you so much about letting go when it's time and waiting for the new things life has in store. The best stories were the one-liners. They tell you so much without many details. A must visit if you're in or around Zagreb",
          "Unique. Very moving. Nice little caf\u00e9.",
          "The wife and I loved this cute little museum. It's pretty adult-oriented, the personal stories here resonate best with those who have lived and loved enough to know loss in their lives.",
          "nice concept",
          "Funny museum ! A lot of stories to read ! Liked it !",
          "Interesting concept and relatively well maintained business. Not all of the exhibits seemed that interesting to me but the minus is also for the fact that some of the audio recordings that we were supposed to be listening to during the tour were missing.",
          "Quite unlike any other museum. The exhibits made me smile, laugh out loud and bring a tear to my eye. Every city should have a museum of broken relationships",
          "Such a beautiful stories from different lovers!!!",
          "A singular experience of love thru broken relationships which doesn't make you sad, but somehow, quite contrary, leaves you with a sense of calm and an impulse to enjoy life to the fullest.",
          "I didn't expect I could find a museum like that! Great idea and the exhibits worth your time. Memories never fade, feelings nor...",
          "The name seems to be tongue in cheek.But it has a great little cafe Coffee shop.",
          "Not worth the entrance fee. Nothing to see",
          "Interesting stories,  but lots of reading.  My eyes hurt when finished there. Needs sonething more...",
          "A unique museum based on a creative and ingenious idea. The objects in the exhibition are not valuable or special themselves but once you read the attached stories they become interesting. Visiting the museum gives you many hints for reflection and self thinking.",
          "Interesting concept on how people moved on from their past relationships.",
          "I really don't recommend this musuem",
          "Really interesting and in a strange way nice museum! The staff is friendly and the coffee at their Cafe is really good.",
          "Unusual museum. Entertaining. Interesting stories. The caffe inside is charming.",
          "Really fascinating place. Some stores are funny some are tragic but they all make you look at what you have and appreciate it that bit more",
          "Incredible stories from relationships long, short, good, terrible, and everywhere in between",
          "I'm really sorry...but I don't get what the big fuzz is all about.... Weird stories of people that hang on to very weird stuff... \n\nWould I recommand it? No...keep your 4-5 euros",
          "Quirky,  sad,  poignant and thought provoking. Worth a visit if you're in the Old Town.  40 kuna per person.",
          "Quite a distinctive twist on a museum with many interesting exhibits from the sad to the odd.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit",
          "IMO, it doesn't deserve its good reputation. A really dull museum with few and equally indifferent exhibits. Around 6\u20ac for each visitor. Could offer way more funny stories than that. Could have read some similar stories online instead.",
          "I'm so glad I came here. I've wanted to visit this museum for a while and I wasn't disappointed. It was so good. Highly recommended.",
          "Very interesting museum concept centered around individual stories of real life people from various parts of the world presented in form of stories surrounding donated exhibits!",
          "Interesting diversion from standard history...",
          "I loved it! You'll have to read a lot, get ready :) The exhibition is pretty big, various rooms. Some stories are amusing, but the majority are serious. There's also a very nice cafe right next to the museum :)",
          "This museum was really cool. Prepare to do some reading while there as each artifact has a story and it\u2019s essential to read them. Some are funny, some are sad, and some so cruel your heart will drop. There is a Book of Confessions that is fun to read and you can add your own blurb.",
          "if ur into romance and emotions about the loss of people in your life, you should definitely go there, it takes about an hour!",
          "Great place to visit!!!",
          "This museum is a very special space in the world, dedicated to love and letting go. It is some parts wistful, most parts hopeful - I found myself cheering on the protagonists of the lives left behind with these once loved exhibits. Come here to feel that you are not alone. A must visit when in Zagreb.",
          "The idea is super awesome, but I didn't personally like the exhibition itself. Some of the artifacts and their descriptions still make me laugh, but others were either too lengthy and a bit boring, or honestly depressing (e.g. suicide \u2026",
          "Kool one",
          "Interesting and  different  museum.",
          "Very beautiful and interesting concept.  The museum itself deserves additional patronage and funding.  Great location to start off a walk down the hill to lower Zagreb.  Excellent interactive capabilities were in use by some young people clearly in need of sharing their stories.",
          "Unique museum. Still a bit rough around the edges but maybe that's part of the charm. Whether or not the stories are real, there are some really well written pieces",
          "Concept is good and different  stories from different people not only lovers but parent's as well but not too great.",
          "so far the best museum and place to visit in zagreb! Although very small, I spend there 1,5 h withholding my breath\n\nsome v creative mind got onto this marvellous idea and developed it just brilliantly! \n\nI think that also other co-visitors \u2026",
          "Interesting \ud83e\uddd0",
          "Was interesting to see what people held on to in a relationship. Obviously by letting that object go they felt they were moving on. Made a nice alternative to paintings and artefacts.",
          "Unique place to visit but a lot of stories are not interesting or special. You need to read a lot to find something interesting. Some requisites don't work.",
          "Loved it. Unique exhibits that cover not only romantic relationships but estranged parents, too. Some are intentionally making fun at their spite (like the toaster of vindication) and others had my heart hurting (the mother's suicide note). \u2026",
          "Great concept,  for a quick hour. Small, but do have ac. Also souvenirs are available. Something different in a 'museum' point of view.",
          "A unique experience. Located in the heart of the city. Be prepared for a few laughs, but for some dark stories, too.",
          "Very unusual, definitely worth checking out!",
          "Heart warming",
          "Very interesting.  Lots of reading.   Be prepared to read and take your time.",
          "Funny and heartbreaking at the same time. 5 stars.",
          "Super interesting",
          "A very wonderful experience as I\u2019ve got to read a very poignant message of the story of a Broken Relationships which I never thought It happened.",
          "Quirky museum.  Worth a visit.  Various physical mementos from failed relationships with corresponding stories.  As it sounds, it's very sad.  And completely hilarious.  Sometimes at the same time.  \n\nIt's not high tech.  Young kids will be \u2026",
          "Very unique museum, the stories behind the different exhibits are very interesting. It's well worth a visit. What's also great is that the staff ensure the museum doesn't get too crowded. ",
          "Way better than I thought, small though",
          "Very unusual collection of what are the saddest times in the lives of ordinary people, who just happen to have chosen to share their stories with the work.  Some funny, some heartbreaking.  Worth the time!",
          "Nice place. Museum with a cafe.",
          "Cute, delightfully angsty and poignant little museum. Worth a quick visit if you\u2019re in the area",
          "The only museum where I read every single placard/label. The museum is fairly small, but fairly content rich. Allot about 1.5 - 2 hours for the visit and read through all of the items. The experience is very unique and emotional so go with \u2026",
          "It might not be what you expect. Simple tokens left by people who had their relationships of any kind (love, family, friends) broken. Every item is accompanied by a short story. You can have the stories translated in many languages in the \u2026",
          "Not your usual museum, with a unique range of exhibits ranging from romantic to family relationships.\nDefinitely worth having a look round even if it's just to pass some time, took about an hour to read all the stories.\nIt can get quite \u2026",
          "Very unique and interesting place! Worth the visit!",
          "So lovely...",
          "A lot of reading.. I was expecting more \"strange\" or \"surprising\" relationships stories, however most of them were pretty normal and regular to me. However interesting idea and worth seeing.",
          "A one of a kind musuem in Zagreb. If you're visiting the city this is a must see. Very touching stories.",
          "Unique, interesting and quite diverse",
          "Not my cup of tea, but not that expensive. Go to the back room and read stories about lost parents, much deeper than the teenage romance stuff (caveat: personal preference)",
          "Cool place with some heartbreaking stories! Nice to visit!",
          "It's an interesting visit",
          "The museum will make you cry and laugh and is so much fun - big recommendation!!",
          "Most entertaining,  curiously delightful.",
          "Definitely worth visiting !",
          "Definitely worth the visit.... so many stories of heart-break sadness and some hilarious stories.... look for the axe.... savage retribution!",
          "Unique and well worth a visit for a deep dive into our shared humanity.",
          "Very interesting exhibit that rotates frequently. Wonderful platform for healing, both for those who have contributed and those who visit.",
          "Based on reading, not too exciting. Good shop.",
          "The concept of the museum is different then in other museums. People are telling their stories and exponating their \"special\" items. In the end I got too tired of reading all of the stories. Still I really liked it.",
          "Not a bad place for a walk around. It is items with stories attached relating to any sort of break up.",
          "Classic camp place near to cold river Mroznica",
          "Well I don\u2019t really want to say it but it was a funny way to spend 20-30 minutes until the rain stopped. They also have a cafe with less funny service but maybe that\u2019s the point?",
          "Very unique museum. Ordinary objects have become an amazing medium to tell a story about a broken relationship.",
          "A must-see if you're in Zagreb, an intimate and well-curated collection of objects that fit with the theme. An excellent concept for a museum that a lot of institutions could learn from.",
          "if you have enought time to discover the beauty of Zagreb this is another interestig place... if you have just a couple of hours there are many other places to visit first.",
          "Many of the items have very emotional stories. The atmosphere is very fitting. There's a book where you can sign your name forever.",
          "Most of the stories make you think on them. Some are just funny and others make you sad or even angry. It's nice to get some idea of what other people have to struggle with and that you're not the only one feeling down when things seem \u2026",
          "Everyday love stories. Steeped in reality. \nIf you love romance - but not necessarily the happily ever after, this is a must visit.",
          "Beautiful place!",
          "A fantastic concept, brought to life beautifully and not in the slightest cheesy. Very interesting and stimulating in fact. Enjoyed it immensely.",
          "The most advertised museum with no any valuable display except love stories. They have very uniqe souvenirs in Zagreb.",
          "Good museum",
          "It's a good moment in the museum, and a lot of reading.",
          "Stories belong to others life.",
          "Very interesting place to visit. At the end you can feel a bit sad.",
          "This museum is an absolute wonder. Even when I planned to check this museum out, I was surprised by the things displayed followed by personal stories. It gave me comfort and warmed my heart very much. This was by far my favorite museum in Zagreb.",
          "I expected more illusions",
          "A lot of emotion, different kind of museum",
          "The museum is too small for what you pay. However, it's very captivating to spend an hour reading those random stories. You'll laugh and you'll get emotional, it's a real rollercoaster. I would say that it gets too busy and eventually it's \u2026",
          "Great hour or so spent here. Some sad/funny/interesting stories.",
          "I visited this place yesterday, having previously visited nearly 4 years ago. I was moved just as much the second time around.  It is my favourite museum ever. There's something so powerful about actually seeing an object and reading the \u2026",
          "Interesting! Not spectacular.",
          "Very interesting, but also very small.",
          "The museum is really an interesting place, very unique place of this kind. Some stories are said, shocking, controversial, exciting, crazy. Definitely must see in Zagreb.",
          "Fun museum to walk around, with lots of fun stories, sometimes also sad ones.",
          "Run by really nice people & certainly an eye opener .",
          "Worth a visit if you run out of things to do in Zagreb. It displays objects from broken relationships accompanied by a writeup about the object.",
          "Unique, one-of-kind, superb concept, masterfully done!",
          "Very interesting, I enjoyed the visit.\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Worth the visit BUT only for those who have not recently been hurt in love. Can bring you to tears.",

          "Nice little museum!!! Happy, sad, funny, and heartwarming",
          "A small, but different kind of museum. It's fun to read the different stories, but in the end it is becoming a little triviel.",
          "Good stuff! But some had very long reads that did not have the reward at the end. So lots of wasted effort. Then again, was that the point?"

          "This is situated just off the Joseph Jelacic Square, through some sliding glass doors. We'd seen the observation deck in Bratislava but this couldn't have been more different - the girl in Bratislava couldn't even be bothered to look up from filing her nails as she took our",

          "This place was great. The views were the best in town. The set up is unique, instead of gaudy souvenirs stands, it\u2019s a lounge where you can relax, have a drink, or play games. Pay no mind to the negative reviews complaining about the bars obstructing views of the city or not",
          "Really enjoyed this the view was good and you can go back the same day as many times as you want the bar was good to",
          "A beautiful quaint city worth a visit especially winter. The Christmas markets around the area are varied and all interesting. The city has planned for not one market but several in the city.",
          "This place offers a great view of Zagreb and also has a cute area to sit and order drinks or play board games and hang out. Also, your ticket is valid all day so you can come back in the evening and see it at night as well as during the day. Definitely worth a visit while you\u2019re",

          "Illica was so close to everything. We walked from our apartment to the Main Square, Cathedtral and everything was closeby. Such a lovely town with beautiful architecture and cordial people. Everything about the city was nice. Very convenient to travel in trams. Evening walks",

          "A wonderful city for walking and exploring architecture, although sad to see some of the non-landmarked buildings that have survived through 2 world wars falling to neglect",
          "The entrance is free if you have a Zagreb Card, you may check it out if you do. But if you're paying, I wouldn't recommend it. First of all it has bars all around the windows for safety reasons, so it feels like you're in a prison. If you want to take a picture of the view",
          "I have no idea where to start. We were first of all greeted by a teenager who\u2019s first words were \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta pay\u201d. More than happy to pay - but please sell the experience to me first! We arrived on the 16th floor and the place was empty. Initially we were curious why, but now",
          "As others have pointed out, this is actually 270 degrees, since you can only go on three sides. It wouldn't be such a problem, if the view wasn't blocked by metal bars. To take a photo, I had to put my phone behind the bars, which would end up in a disaster if it slipped out of",
          "Pretty disappointing. 60 Kunas for an adult ticket and for what? To look out from behind what seem like prison bars. You have to put your camera through the bars if you want to take a photo of the city. Too pricey for what it is, and it is not really what they advertise.",

          "This was one of the many things we found to fill our day with in Zagreb that we could take our dog to. They received him happily and fetched water for him too! Its a nice place to spend some time and relax with a drink, there isn't a food cafe up there however you are able to",

          "There is SO much to see and do here. I only spent three days and barely saw half of it. I would love to go back and see all the unique museums and get inside some of those churches. GO TO THE NATIONAL PARK!!! TAKE a small group tour. It is AMAZING and I have been to 64",
          "Did this on our Zagreb Card as it was one of the included attractions. Was good to see the city from this height but nothing spectacular. Staff were friendly. Visit only took half an hour maximum. Could have stayed in the bar up there longer but had other things to do.",
          "This observatory is located on 16 th floor of a building on a Main Street. The entry ticket is 8\u20acper person. One can view the whole city from top. The only negative was that the deck is covered by iron rods instead of glass. It becomes difficult to take clear pictures.",
          "It has a good view of the city and you can easily see where everything is. My favourite is definitely the red parasols of the market but I would not go back that quickly! The one good thing is that your ticket allows you entrance back at night if you want to but we did not even",

          "View behind bars is a bit a turnoff when one expects to have a 360\u00b0 view. Nice to see but no need to see.",

          "If you are visiting Zagreb you should check the main skyscraper (ugly) at the main square, there is an elevator andn2 min later you are at the roof of Zagreb.",

          "We visited from the sunset time to the evening, and the view of the city was amazing. There is a cafe bar inside of the deck, so even in the winter you can sit down and get warm. I intentionally avoided daytime assuming most of the city would have been blurred by sunshine.",
          "This is absolutely 360 degrees view not sure what some of the reviewers are on about. You have to walk round the 2 halves to see the full view. We visited in the morning and evening to get the contrast. It was lovely seeing the Christmas markets lit up from above. Remember to",
          "This observation deck is great for everyone who wants to see Zagreb from up high. The staff is polite and professional. There's even a cool board game. I definitely recommend.",

          "The ticket is 60kn (8\u20ac), a little bit pricey, in my opinion. Moreover, I was expecting a balcony but I found myself on a narrow surrounded by iron bars. I had a camera, so it was easier for me to take pics, but my friends had to spread their arms out of the bars in order to take",
          "Very surprised that other people say it cost less than we paid- which was 60 kuna per person. As everyone else says, it is not entirely 360 degrees as not built like that and the bars do get in the way. The ticket allows you up to the viewpoint anytime that day- so, I suggest",
          "It is NOT 360, but rather 270 degrees. View frustratingly obscured by metal cage. Avoid it. So desperate for customers that they have staff on ground floor coaxing people in. Also offers free unlimited pass with ticket!",
          "I went there with some friends,it had 360 views of the whole city, The good thing was when you buy a ticket you can go back as many times as you want the same day,so we went back again in the evening.",
          "The Zagreb 360 is located on the 16th floor of the Zagreb sky scraper. It is a restaurant with an observation deck overlooking the Ban Jelasic square. It is ok for sights, but nothing spectacular. The tall hilly backdrop of the upper Town with the spectacular St Mark's church in",
          "the entrance ticket is around 8 Euros (you can come and go many times on the same day). obviously not the most expensive attraction, but some might feel a little underwhelmed. there is a bar area, where you can buy mid priced drinks (according to Zagreb standards) and chill out.",
          "A very unassuming city. Not sure anything can be recommended as not to be missed. Zagreb is really more of a means to get to other cities in Croatia.",
          "Was expecting more but it ended up similar to many other European cities. Quite cosmopolitan and friendly but not a lot of history or charm",
          "A good place to chill and view the city of Zagreb. With good service at the bar and a huge screen showing MTV, really a nice place to relax after all the walking around Zagreb. I would recommend this place for an overview of the city of Zagreb.",
          "The lounge area of this place is great. The view around the building is alittle restricted by the bars but it\u2019s still beautiful. Entrance fee also includes a return visit on the same day and the recommend going after sunset. That view was amazing too, we watched a thunder storm",
          "Gave us the best views of Zagreb and we took some of our best photos here. We went during the day and were allowed to return free of charge in the evening to see the city at night. Bar quite reasonable prices also",
          "We had a Zagreb card so this was free in. Lift takes you up to 16th floor. Great views of city and staff v friendly. We had a relaxing drink after walking outside on the deck. Great way to get an overview of city.",
          "Compared to other cities which have these viewpoints, this wasn\u2019t that great. Despite its name you cannot travel 360 degrees around and there are railings all around which make it feel quite prison like. We got in on student price but would feel the adult price is too much. On",
          "Best place to be Love it \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d It\u2019s on the rooftop of the building and you see the whole city Regards David",
          "Beautiful view, you can see the ban Jela\u010di\u0107 squere, catedral, I took fantastic photos there and the interior is very nice",
          "Went up for a look at around noon and enjoyed the spectacular views from all sides, across the whole city. It is well laid out and safe to take families up with safety barriers all round. The host pointed out that we could come back later at no extra charge to see the view at",
          "Zagreb is in middle of country so not near the water. There is plenty to see and do in the city. Beer/wine is cheaper than Dubrovnik. Great views from 360 roof top bar.",
          "If you buy a ticket to Zagreb 360 it is typically valid for both a night and day trip. It's a really nice way to check out the city and is in an interesting area. There is a bar and limited snacks. During the day there are board games and the movable chairs and couches mean you",
          "Thats an amazing place to visit. It was summer, very hot but perfect for visiting this stunning place, i could not beleive that can be such a beautiful place",
          "This was the 1st stop for our group after arriving in Zagreb. The views were magnificent, the drinks were good and reasonably priced, and the staff was delightful. I\u2019m a bit nervous about heights so after a short time on the balcony outside I returned inside to await my wife",
          "It does provide a nice view of the city but the big railing around does spoil the view a bit. Wouldn\u2019t be high up on my list of things to do especially if you strapped for time",
          "Very close to the centre, and is definitely worth the visit. With the ticket you can visit the desk more than once. We visited the place in the noon and again in the night.",
          "Just in centre square there is a rather sad, dark skyscraper... there are no signs... but just approach the entrance door and ask to go to the 16th floor: you'll pay about 10 euros and you'll receive a card that will allow you to go back anytime you want. Amazing views and",
          "Clearly a local night hotspot and music venue, but this should not be offered just for the view. The 8 Euro per person cost is just not worth stepping outside when you can see it all from inside. We noticed that the locals went up for a drink and showed visitors from inside",
          "Went there for a drink, expecting much, but getting so much more. Pleasant music, nice staff and a breathtaking view. Maybe not fpr family visits, but couples, solo or friends - do it. Prices are ok, not cheap, but have in mind you're also paying for the view, but it's worth it.",
          "Loved the views over Zagreb in every directions and the fabulous bar where you could have drinks. You can get a mulitple entry pass so you can go back later in the day like we did and watch the lights come up over Zagreb and the Sunset and sip Champagne- what beter way to end",
          "Nice view of Zagreb but not worthy of 60 hrk (8\u20ac) entrance fee. View is protected by bars (instead of net or some glass) making you feel like in jail. There is no single binocular which can help you see better but most surprisingly there is no any history legend explaining more",
          "This is probably one of the must see places in Zagreb. The view from the top of the building is impressive. You can see the whole town from different angles and photograph the main attractions from there. The best thing is if you go there by noon, since exactly at 12 PM they",
          "It's expensive. It's not as awesome as the other viewing spots. It's just not as great as they advertise and you feel really cheated out of your 60kn.",
          "Disappointed the viewing area was covered in metal bars. Hard to get good photos and get good vibe when you feel like your in jail. Was good to get an overview of the hole area and point out main interest points. Can have drinks served in this area.",
          "It worth the money to get the best view of the city. I would say to go after 6PM to miss the crowds. A great cafe as well with reasonable prices.",
          "You pay 60 Kuna for nothing. A view from the balcony blocked by bars where you can\u2019t take proper pictures unless you stick your phone outside the bars which is of course risky. Literally just a balcony. You can get to see the same amazing view from any place up high for free.",
          "We paid an entrance fee and stayed 2 mins. Literally no panoramic view like what you would expect. The bars block the whole view so the only way to get a picture is to stick your phone outside the bars, this means you can get a picture of your self with the view, unlike what was",
          "I really don't recommend the eye, you have to pay 60 kuna to get in, to see a view obstructed by bars, you can't take pictures of yourself with it!!",
          "60 Kr to get in - but you can reuse your pass in the evening so worth a revisit to get great views of the city - the sky bar was not busy on either visit and they have clean loos ! If you have a problem with heights then probably not for you",
          "I liked our visit to Zagreb Eye, they are right when they say it's a must of Zagreb. The scenery from up there is great and the bars people keep complaning about are really not that bad. If you are careful enough you can take pictures out of the bars. Don't regret going there.",
          "OK. Views of the whole city. However, really obstructed by the metal bars so makes it difficult to take photos. Bar is nice to relax with good music. Staff friendly and fast wifi. It's not expensive to go out but not sure if it's really worth it.",
          "Not sure if I would recommend this place, hard to find the entrance, then up you go in the lift, walk onto a cement floor with high railings, take a few photos and back down, but then again it was nice to be able to see Zagreb sights high above the city",
          "The views are good but severely hindered by metal bars which also restrict photo opportunities. As others have noted it is not 360 degrees as only three sides are accessible. One one side there are some seats for customers to sit and enjoy the view but all these do is block what",
          "You have a nice view of the city! It worths it daytime and night time as well. When you go up to the top you can enjoy a drink with a view. The staff is really nice and helpful. I got a card what I can use for a year to visit the observation deck so can't wait to be back. :)",
          "Really enjoyed visiting Zagreb. Simplicity and history come together in concert. Enjoyable food and friendly locals who go out of their way to help. I can not wait to go back.",
          "Perched above the city on the observation deck of 1 Ilica Street, adjacent to Ban Jelacic Square, is the Zagreb Eye. The Eye offers you a 360 degree view of Zagreb, and a lounge - complete with hammocks. There is an outdoor walkway around the edge of the observation deck,",
          "The view is amazing from above. The lookout is located in the Jelasic square, pretty easy to find, you will see signs everywhere luring you to the tower. I think it is worth a visit once you are in Zagreb, you should see the whole city in one. I found it a little bit pricey, but",
          "Always wanted to check what is in the Zagreb eye... I decided to pay the money 60 kunas ...it took less than 5 mins to check the top roof... the people working in there are very polite and helpful , but I believe the ticket should include a free drink or a discount in the bar.",
          "Nice view, but not worth the money, it should be much cheaper. We came during the Advent time and had few drinks that at least one of them could ha e been includet in price. The walk is not completely all around andon a busy night, we waited a while for the elevator go down.",
          "Place that requires to be visited with girlfriend or wife, very romantic. Windy and cold in winter time. Perfectly positioned, very cleaned and with stuff for smokers. Very nice place.",
          "worth a visit to see the charm of the city - from all sides there are places that you cant see from the ground - take the time and even have a coffee up there",
          "Definitely a tourist trap, and definitely not worth a visit. We came here at night time to see the views of the city but we were very disappointed. The view itself is nice enough but we\u2019d had better views for free at other viewing points across the city. The main issue with this",
          "It is a very nice place for tourists, the view is stunning, perhaps the best panoramic view of Zagreb upper and lower town. The offer of drinks should be much better and the place itself classier.",
          "The view is definitely the best in the city. It is cosy/homey feeling of the place.You can play board games,listen to music or just admire the great view of Zagreb.Prices are moderate,you have to pay ticket before entering, but it is worth it.Enjoy!",
          "Zagreb Eye 360 is the perfect observation dock, one can see the panorama view of the whole city, while having a drink or dinner...",
          "once you have bought a ticket you can visit as many times as you want. we went up in the day and once it was dark. Great views, there were free tasters of local foods",
          "It's true!!! Zagreb eye indeed. See the heart if Zagreb \"Ban Jelancic square\" all laid out below you. Makes for great landscape and architecture photography. Worth visiting while in Zagreb.",
          "Nice spot to view panorama. Vibe is good, people playing board games (available in caffe). Will come agan.",
          "I did think it was quite expensive in comparison to other attractions in Zagreb. However, you can go up and down as many times as you wanted within a day so we did three times at different times of the day - we did afternoon, sunset and night. That made it much more worth it.",
          "This place offers good views on 3 sides but it\u2019s not possible to walk all the way around. Also when I went yesterday there was an event there so was somewhat a strange situation where I was basically pushed outside as quick as possible. Definitely not worth 60kN",
          "Worth a visit and not expensive, but as i said nothing special.. Like most of Zagreb, staff are very friendly and polite.",
          "Situated in the heart of Zagreb, with the entrance on the main square (Jelacic square), Zagreb Eye 360 is the place to drink coffee with the best view in Zagreb...",
          "We went here as it\u2019s their biggest building. As I have been in taller I wasn\u2019t expecting too much. However I was pleasant surprised we ended up spending a couple of hours there. We had a chocolate to start with, they advised us to help ourselves to some of their local produce ie",
          "With Zagreb cards in hand we headed up Zagreb's inner city sky scraper - all 16 stories of it. Seriously - much higher than it sounds as everything around it is only 1-2 stories. Especially this time of year during the Zagreb Christmas festival, in our opinion, visiting the",
          "Visited the Eye as part of a weekend break with good friends. What was meant to be a short visit turned into two of great entertainment with carved ham, sausage, bread and mulled wine. Hosts were brilliant and musician was friendly and seemed to our company as much as we",
          "Great view of the wonderful city of Zagreb. The lady at the counter was very polite and helpful. 360 view over the city very well recommended. Price is around 80 Kuna if I'm not mistaken.",
          "You can see the whole Zg. But sadness is all in the tubs so it feels like a prison. It's not bad to visit. The entrance is 60 kn per person. If you are a tourist in Zg is not a missing go up :)",
          "This a high building in zagreb you can watch all zagreb from the height,there are very beautiful views from there.I think this building is a place which worth to visit and have some relax time in the evening beacuse there is a nice cafe with friendly servers.",
          "Firstly this is not 360 degrees with only 3 sides available. And the sides that are able to be viewed are covered with prison bars. This is completely ridiculous. Why not use solid clear glass like every other high-rise view tower throughout the world? The price for these",
          "It was great to enjoy the city views from Zagreb Eye (terrace), which is a located in a building on the 16th floor in the City centre. You can look at the city from all 4 sides of the building, enabling you to spot most of City attractions like Zagreb Cathedral, City Square",
          "This is a must but on a clear day. Wonderful, friendly, English speaking staff. Very helpful and informative. You will get a card which gives you big discounts on almost all museums for the duration of your stay. Views are amazing. They a lovely coffee shop with a menu for",
          "Lovely views of Zagreb. You receive a membership card which gives you access for 1 year, and if you had time, it would be great to come up at night. seating, games etc provided.",
          "It's not much, just an Observation platform but it offers a nice view over the city. A Zagreb Eye card also entitles you to some discounts to local attraction and museums. We were there at the very end of September, and it was not busy. There's a bar there and you can enjoy a",
          "This is a beautiful spot to take lots of pictures of the city of Zagreb. It is next to the funicular stop at the top. It's a location on the walking tours",
          "first thing : it's not 360\u00b0, it's 270\u00b0. Prison like bars obstructing the view, when you step out to the terrace you will notice a huge dent in the middle of an already narrow space which is really irritanting wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even if it were for free",
          "I highly recommend it for first timers in Zagreb, where you get to see an over view of the city at different angles. Staff are very friendly and nice, there\u2019s a cafe where you can enjoy your drink also there\u2019s a designated smoking area outside. Your stay duration isn\u2019t limited.",
          "We look this short ride up to the upper town. Just walked around to look at the buildings, especially the colorful tiles on St. Mark's Church where there was a wedding taking place. As parsed the funicula down we were asked if we would leave the car so the photographer could",
          "Great panoramic view, about 270 degrees. There are big bars blocking some of your view (I guess this is how prisoners view the world from their cells). Actually your camera will have a better view - less obstruction - than you yourself. The nice thing is that you have multiple",
          "The price to mount the 360\u00b0 Zagreb is 8 \u20ac for an adult which is rather expensive. Staff is friendly. View is beautiful. Loung chaires to have a rest.",
          "It's an OK attraction, although a bit weird (tries to be too chic?). Also, could have done with way fewer bars on the balcony, although they are wide enough you can get photos without the bars in them. We spent about 15min up there, and promptly went on our way, there are more",
          "We really enjoy a view from Zagreb eye. It is realy a great place to see the city and to get a great photos of Zagreb. If you come around 12:00 (before Gric cannon fires) focus on the Gric. As we are from Zagreb, buying a yearly ticket (for 60 HRK) is quite conveniant for us,",
          "The Zagreb Eye is ok. You can get some nice photos from the top, especially at night, though the interior of the cafe and music is pretty cheesy and there were only a few people both times we went up. Entry is 60KH per person and this entities people to visit on-going. Once we",
          "Next to the main square (Ban Jelacic Square) there is this building. You can go up the elevator here and for a bit less than \u20ac10 you can enter the skydeck and enjoy the view. I went at night so the city center had some nice lights. The view of the main square is particularly",
          "There are two points in Zagreb, where one can see the entire city... one is from the castle top tower & the other at 360* view point...",
          "You just have to stand real close to the bars to take these kind od photos. The view is magnificent. As a bonus you can play cute board games while you drink your beverage of choice.",
          "Well considering this was called the Zagreb Eye, I was disappointed to find it was a viewing platform above a tower block. After the mixed reviews on here, we did the Lotrscak tower instead and this has lots of history attached to it!!",
          "If you are looking for a place to sit back, relax and have a drink then you found the spot. You can also enjoy a board game too. Bar area is enclosed in glass but host will open the sliding door to let you in/out on to the observation deck. It's a narrow walk way 3/4 ways around",
          "I bought a 72-hour card here. I was disappointed with the thick bars covering the viewing window and the lack of ventilation in the top floor facility. Also, this was the first observation deck I've been to with no binoculars or similar equipment to use. I took pictures",
          "Wherever I go, I like to get up high and get a good view of the whole place. I found myself quite disappointed by the Zagreb eye. I found it quite expensive for what it is. Essentially - it is just the top floor of a skyscraper. It has a board game on some tables and seating up",
          "Each city I go to, I make sure that I visit the eye, the top and alike in the city that overlook the whole city. Alas, this place could be amazing if they had to remove the very annoying bars and also if it's a real 360 view. One of the sides is blocked, I guess it's the",
          "A little pricey, but the ticket is valid all day, if you want to come back. It's not a bad place to relax if your feet are hurting from all the walking around. Plenty of comfortable chairs and a few board games. There is a small bar. The view is quite good despite the safey bars",
          "Great city views of Zagreb from the 16th floor observation deck. Situated next to the main square, Trg Ban Jelicic, opened long hours and the pass is valid all day. Reasonable priced entry and there is a cafe there as well.",
          "Worth the view! It is a place for tourist! The prices are high, the service is friendly but always thinking about the profit ... It's a shame the security railing... prevents you from truly enjoying the scenery! even so, if you are not short of money, it is worth knowing!",
          "Quite expensive to go up, but we did get a stamp that meant we could return later in the day and spend more time up there. They serve drinks up there (no food), and the service was a little slow, but it was okay. It was nice and relaxing and pretty quiet so good for a chill out.",
          "This was a fabulous place to chill out for a while. Loads of comfy chairs to sit back with a drink and relax or even play a board game. You can also walk around and view the city from any direction.",
          "Definitely recommended. Despite the many circular steps we had to take to reach it, it was all worth the time and the effort. Simply a breathtaking view of the city. Just Spectacular! We expected to find a huge crowd up there but it was just us and some other 4 people. Very",
          "The main attraction of the Zagreb Eye is that it offers unlimited entries on the same day, and a night club (for kids as well) at night. There is a small bar, some really comfortable seats and board games for families. At night you may come again, free of additional charge, and",
          "The tallest building in the relatively low city of Zagreb, so you are sure to have a good view over the whole city. Experiencing it once is enough in my opinion!",
          "Quite interesting a good place to get your bearings. The huge bars are a problem. Why they need is mistifying. Has not been carefully thought through. Cafe univiting . Nice to look down on the main Plaza",
          "Definitely would recommend going up here. We went at sunset and it was surprisingly not busy and they gave us a stamp to go back later in the day. So I would recommend going up during the day and getting a stamp to return at sunset or at night. There's also a nice bar at the top",
          "The place is really cheesy! The view is blocked by big fences and it is nearly impossible to take nice photos. Drinks are made badly and the place was empty on a Friday night a part for a couple of drunk old people.",
          "The Zagreb Eye is in downtown. It has nice views indeed. But the bars are too big and if you make a selfie you like if you are in a prison cell. A little bit expensive i think. Hint: go here first and make a zagreb card for free to get discounts to some attractions.",
          "Nice view at the top of Zagreb eye. Nice prices and wonderful staff. Only 8 euros entrance. We even got the Zagreb365-card that gave us discounts around the city. We used it all next day. Nice prices in the bar. We played Ludo for hours. Nice touch in the bar.",
          "I went with my friends to have a drink... the music was nice and the ambience 10/10. And the best thing ever was the view!! So amazing. I recommend to go before sunset so you can have daylight, sunset and city light views.",
          "A very beautiful place if you want to see Zagreb, from above. Cheap, 60Kn, approximately 8 Euro for adults. Very nice personal and a good place to drink a coffee, on the top of Zagreb.",
          "We only went there because it was included in our Zagreb Card for FREE. Otherwise I really don't think it is worth the money. And it is really just a tall building with a cafe on top. Keep in mind that it is not really a 360 degree view, since you can only on until a certain",
          "I stumbled on this by accident and was gladly surprised. For a few euro, I went up and saw the city, there is also a nice bar and relaxing area there also. Although I didn't see the signs, (maybe not signposted enough) I had brought a bottle of water out on the observation area",
          "I went to see Zagreb, my city, from above. Wonderful experience, the view is spectacular. With the card you buy, you can go up whenever you want so the next time I go up will be in the evening.",
          "I arrived with my friends. You get a fantastic view of the city of Zagreb from all sides. I went in the evening and watched the sunset which was beautiful. The only downfall are the bars that are put in for safety, however they block some of the view. Inside, there are",
          "You are able to see the entire city and just how beautiful it is! The black bars around the outside make it a bit difficult to take photos but not impossible. The hostesses were very friendly! The cafe prices are definitely more expensive but its worth just sitting there to",
          "The view from the 16th floor is lovely (as you would expect), you can visit it more than once with the ticket, the hostesses are friendly, but it only worths the price if you are after good photos to share on social media. I wouldn't go there for drinks or anything else. I think",
          "Great views and very worthwhile photographic spot. I got some great aerial photos of the city here. Very friendly staff and not very crowded....comfortable place to hang out and relax as well. They let you go up and back on one ticket for the day. No long lines...hassle free.",
          "This city is really quite pretty plus old and quant. We stayed for 2 days which was enough when on short stay of the country. Great views from here of the old wonderful buildings and people are very helpful and nice.",
          "We had our Zagreb card and used it to head up to the top of this building. Great view of Zagreb. Didn't have drinks. Don't know how much it costs if you didn't use the Zagreb card, but we wouldn't have done it otherwise.",
          "The bar/restaurant was extremely nice, staff were nice but they won't allow you to take you drinks to the terrace while smoking. Worst thing is the entire place is fully surrounded by metal bars which just ruin the view.",
          "Great experience and a must see while in Zagreb. A view of the St Marks square and the whole city. Entrance ticket is valid for a whole day and one can enjoy lazing around on the comfortable chairs.",
          "Beautiful view of the city. A ticket lets you enter the whole day the ticket was purchased, so make sure you come back after dark to see it lit up. There are drinks and food available at to m the top, but extensive.",
          "The top of this building offers a nice view of the town ans surrounds. Try to forget the bars used for security of the place.",
          "You are surrounded by a cage and they charge you both the way up and the drinks, which are quite expensive",
          "Good value (approx 4-5 Euro) with cafe, comfortable chairs, free WiFi, outlets etc. - staff was friendly as well. Views slightly obstructed by iron bars but overall it's a good way to scope out the city and plan out the travel agenda.",
          "A really great place, the view is absolutely gorgeous. I do recommend it to do by night also, they also have a 20% dissount for groups.",
          "While the view is spectacular on the 16th floor, I was disappointed that the closely spaced bars prevented us from taking a good photo. The 30 kuna fee will allow you to come back for a night view after seeing the view in day light. Open until midnight.",
          "This is a restaurant on top of a building in the famous city square, where you have to pay a cover charge to enter. A bottle of Stella Artois is HRK 18, which is OK, I guess, but I think I should have tried the local brand. Despite the protective steel bars on the balcony, you",
          "Located on the 16th floor, the Zagreb Eye gives a good lookout over Zagreb makes one realize what a large city it actually is. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is an observation deck and restaurant at the top of a 16 storey building in central Zagreb. It advertises 360 degree views which is correct to a degree, but you cannot walk the entire perimeter (one side is blocked off). The card that is given on entry only names buildings",

          "This exhibit was half off with the Zagreb Card, I don't know if I'd want to spend the 30 kuna for the full price entrance. The view is nice, but the bars are very large, making it difficult to take pictures of the city.",
          "While the view is nice, especially if you are familiar of Zagreb, that's about it. Everything is surrounded with prison bars, the bar is limited in service and offer and the height isn't all that great. But, for the price of the ticket, it's not all that bad, try it.",
          "Top floor of a skyscraper in Zagreb's main square. The height isn't impressive, but it is ok, the real problem is in the prison like bars surrounding the object and ruining the view.",

          "This is a great place to go to get views of the city, and to orient yourself to the main tourist areas. The bars were a bit of a distraction, but you could still get good photos if you positioned your camera correctly. Very friendly staff. It's an all day pass, so you can go",

          "For just a small price youll get an awesome few of the whole city! We enjoyed our stay very much. Even if we just came to see zagreb from the sky. Youll get some great shots here so its def worth a visit!",
          "First of all, the attraction is called Zagreb 360\u00b0 but it should be called Zagreb 270\u00b0 because you can't pass through one side. Second of all, the entire view is blocked by freaking metal bars so you can't enjoy the view properly. Seriously, what's the point of the metal bars?",

          "Instead of the standard dates in cafes and bars on weekends, I went to Zagreb eye on a scenic tour of the city. The view is really beautiful, which provides a 16-storey arriving elevator. Admission is kn 30 which is not much considering the location. Prices in the sky bar are",
          "Opened at 10;00 a.m and we were the only ones there for first half hour which was lovely. The entrance fee allows you to come back any time but you must get your wrist stamped. It's not quite 360 degrees but almost. The views are lovely. There is a cafe/bar so you can sit",
          "This is a must. I was there and took lots of pictures from different angles & perspectives from Zagreb and I really enjoyed it. The cafe was great and I had a peaceful time with my coffee and enjoying the view. The staff is really helpful and I definitely recommend everyone to",
          "This is the highest point of the city and provides stunning views of the city. Refreshments are available if needed. Well worth a visit.",
          "Found this place by pure chance, but if you like to see the town from a different angle, this is the place for you. The ticket is valid all day so you can see Zagreb by day and by night as the cafe is open up to midnight.",
          "You are escorted to a lift for the 16th floor, the price is 60 Kuna but you can return during the day (they stamp your hand) if you wish. You are let out of the caf\u00e9 to the walkway which does not go all the way round, which was reduced further by piles of chairs. The view is",
          "I didn't plan to be there, but it was a glorious visit! Amazing point view of Zagreb! The bar is also pretty nice and quite cheap, had a great time there during sunny afternoon! Chilling place!",
          "Wouldn't say this was anything special, especially considering the metal bars make it hard to take pictures but the view is still tremendous. The inside of the top floor is cool with some good seating areas with board games and pretty cheap drinks. Worth the money to spend 30",
          "I was just amazed with the view fron the top. It was sunny and than all of the sudden a shower came, so the view was really special. It is one of my top 5 views in life...",
          "We went to Zagreb Eye for our breakfast in the morning and had a nice fresh juice and coffee. The great thing about this is that you pay the admission for the whole day, we came back in the evening enjoying a different view.",
          "I highly recommend you check out this Attraction in Zagreb (on a clear day). It was difficult for us to find the entrance but it was worth it. We enjoyed the views from up high. We got some great photos. I like that there is a bar you can enjoy a class of wine or hot cocoa.",
          "The Zagreb Eye offers a 360 degree observation deck with views over the city. The set up was a bit annoying as we had to be escorted in the lift to the top floor as there was not a dedicated lift to the observation deck. We were offered binoculars but then were told we had to",
          "Zagreb Eye is a lovely place that you must visited in Zagreb it allows you to see Zagreb from up in all angles (360)",
          "We went in the morning to check out the 360 view of Zagreb, and then later in the evening, we did take-away pizza on street level and brought it up to eat. We bought our drinks at the bar and enjoyed the unexpected jazz band playing our type of music. You can have your hand",
          "Wait for a clear day and enjoy the view. Good news is that the ticket is valid for a full day, so you can come back in the sunset and at night to see different colours.",
          "It's very cheap and ok to visit for the view, but you can't take pictures because of the window fence amplacement all over the sides of the building. The drinks from the bar are a little expensive.",
          "This bar and viewpoint is up on top floor in the city center. No other buildings around with same height disrupting the view. As it is situated in the middle of the city center, u can't find a better high viewpoint. Need to visit if it's a clear day. The ticket is 30 Kuna (4\u20ac)",
          "Amazing. Just amazing! The view is spectacular, I'm only a bit dissapointed because of the fence, there should be a clean glass windows instead so you could take pictures more easily. The pricelist is acceptable, and it's very well thought of. The staff is really nice and the",
          "For a few euros you could enjoy the view of Zagreb and have a few drinks at the bar. At night there is even a karaoke party",

          "We really enjoyed taking pictures on the viewing balcony, and for only 4 Euros we could visit as many times as we wanted that day! So we came back there that night and saw the city in darkness as well, with some lovely white wine :) there is also a board game on some of the",
          "Great experience with great views and a good atmosphere. Also, you get good value for money as you pay 30 Kuna (roughly \u00a33 or \u00a34) and you can visit as many times as you want that day. Drinks are reasonably priced and the board games are great fun :)",
          "I have been here not once but 4 times already. The view is just magnificent. The only bad thing about this place is the ticket, it's 30 HRK which is high comparing to the price of 20 HRK when I was there the 1st time few years ago.",
          "Very cool city view. The observation deck is located on the 16th floor of the building which is pretty much on the main square. The entry fee wasn't too expensive and you also get to come up as many times as you want up until 12. It turns into a night club after 10 or something",
          "Very nice city view. The lounge inside offers board games and drinks while you admire the views. One ticket is good for the entire day so you can go up during the day and then again in the evening.",
          "It is nice view but the photos may not be so nice due to the bars around the observatory. The bar in the deck does not accept credit cards, so if you out of kunas you can't drink.",
          "While the view is not a 360 view, you can still take some photos. You will have to work around the safety bars but I understand the security behind them. The music was nice and I had a drink and chilled for awhile. A margarita was not the option but Pina colada, Bahama Mama, (I",
          "Went up the zagreb eye today. Staff were friendly and helpful, they gave us a stamp and said we were welcome to come back in the evening too (in many other places you'd have to pay twice!). Excellent view of the city. Drinks were reasonably priced. A nice start to our trip :)",
          "The Zagreb Eye is a cafe/restaurant that offers a beautiful view of the lower and upper part of the city of Zagreb. The entrance is around 30 kunas and really worth it to live that experience",
          "open until midnight! we visited on Monday evening, nice music was playing, people were having fun and playing some game. The view is/was just incredible - seeing whole Zagreb in the night during warm August nice - must!",
          "I had read here that because of the protection bars you couldn't really appreciate the view, but it doesn't really bother that much. You can take awesome pictures and have a beautiful view of the city. The interior part is really cozy, you have nice drinks and board games. If",

          "The deck is well made, however instead of Iron grills there should be glass for better pictures and views. Overall the views were excellent especially once the lights are on post sunset.",
          "The Zagreb Eye is a must. It used to be a lot cheaper, but considering the fact you pay once and can visit again anytime in the day, the price is quite alright. The view is amazing, the staff is nice and friendly, they have an amazing interior design inside and enough open space",
          "If you want to se city center from one spot this is the place to go. It is a skyscraper in the center square and you can go on the top of it and circle 360 deegres. Also there is a caffe on top so you can drink coffe/juice and enjoy the view.",
          "The best place to see Zagreb in 360\u00b0 . I will advice you to go one time during the day and another time by night because the landscape is much better with all the lights and the sunset. They have a really nice \"red fruit smoothie \" !",

          "The view is great, and since you can come back and it is at the center, we came back during sunset. Once you are done, it's a really cool place to stay. All the drinks are fairly cheap and the staff is awesome. Don't miss DJ Rene's live karaoke!",
          "While visiting Zagreb eye observation deck I was pleasantly surprised by how lovely the service was. I think the whole experience was worth my money; the view is amazing and I enjoyed the DJ and the karaoke party the most.",
          "Not only it is good value for money, but also allows you to see a bit of everything if you're in the city for just a couple of hours (like us). Better than just queuing up in some other attractions. The lifts are quick and all of the staff members speak good English. If you",

          "This is a great spot to get a different perspective of Zagreb but the venue lacks any character, it feels like an office canteen. No atmosphere at all when I was there during the day and you couldn't spend more than 20 minutes here before you get bored.",

          "30 kuna to go up but you don't really get what is advertised. For safety the top has ugly great big bars so you can't really absorb panoramic views or get a decent photo. It's also not 360 degrees as one quarter is sectioned off. It was pleasant however to have a seat and play a",
          "If you're in Zagreb and have half an hour or so to spare I would definitely recommend paying a visit to the Zagreb Eye. It's only 30HRK and offers a stunning panoramic view of the city that gives a really good sense of the contrast between the upper town, lower town and new",

          "Definitely would recommend visiting the Zagreb Eye!! It is a cheap way to get a priceless view of the beautiful city. The ticket is good for 24hours, so save your receipt and go in the morning/afternoon/night. Bonus: the staff is incredibly friendly & it is air conditioned! Fun",
          "Been to Zagreb Eye now quite some times and I really like the place! Although 16th store is not quite high - at least compared to other cities - you can enjoy the view over the old town towards Sljeme. Personally I like the place because it is quite relaxing, has a good WLAN and",
          "This is located on top of the tallest building in Zagreb. The views are decent, but don't expect anything amazing - this is nowhere near as high as most observation decks in other European countries. Worth noting that your ticket will allow you a second visit on the same day,",

          "We really enjoyed the Zagreb 360' Eye. The view was great, the entry price was low and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Also the bar is highly recommended, they offer good quality drinks for great prices in a relaxed atmosphere. A must visit in Zagreb.",
          "Whoever thought it was a good idea to break the nice panaromic view of the city with hundreds (literally) of metal poles deserves to be put behind bars. Terribly disruptive design. Drink prices are typical cafe rates. 30 Kunas is not very expensive. Students get it for 15",
          "A nice unexpected surprise in the city centre. For a not-too-high fee, you can get a view of the town square and the buildings around it.",
          "We are both suckers for buildings with observation decks, so when in Zagreb we found this place quickly (and it was only steps from our Hotel Dubrovnik). It costs about $10 US and you can return again the same day without another charge. We saw the 360 degree view in the",
          "Well worth the 30kn for admission. Highly recommended. The cafe has superb espresso, and tea biscuits.",
          "Very odd set up. A girl shows you to a lift and another girl at the top takes your money. The views are very good but the metal bars spoil photo taking unless you're brave enough to put camera/phone through the bars. You can have a drink up there but I didn't the point as you",
          "You can go up to and get a bite to eat. Mostly it's just a fun place to look down on the whole city. The 30 kuna to get in isn't bad. It's less than $5 US. You can stay as long as you like. See if you can spot Maksimir Park. It's like the Central Park of Zagreb. Now that you've",
          "I went to the Zagreb Eye twice during my stay here! The view is amazing. I recommend going after you've explored the main points of Zagreb because then you can look back and see where you were and how landmarks are positioned in relation to each other. The Zagreb Eye is one of",
          "It cost kn30 to enter, after I waited for someone to escort me to the top. There is not obvious signs that you must be escorted, I just happened to see a employee exiting and asked; but, once I paid the admission price it is worth it to see the city from this vantage point.",

          "Staff is very friendly. I had a problem with my mobile network and did not understand the croatian instructions on the sim card and she helped me translate and figure things out. Thanks so much for going out of your way to help some clueless tourists! Drinks and views were",
          "It is not 360 degrees, it is 300! The view is great but it is too expensive for that few minutes there because you have nothing to do there except drink something in cafe which is, again too expensive!",
          "Lovely views of the whole city, there's a handy cafe at the top, got the job done. They've got lots of big board games which is cool (if you know how to play, instructions would be handy). Also maybe a little more signage downstairs to make the entrance obvious for us stupid",
          "this is where to get the best views in town from. the cafe bar area is contemporary and funky. making great use of lighting and space.",
          "Totally worth it even if you only go during the day and don't come back later ( even though your admission allows you to revisit at nite ) Gives you a great vantage point ( and photo opp) to see much of the old city from above. Relaxing and roomy inside and view all around",
          "If you are affraid of heights - don't experience this adventurous 16 floor thrill. :) It is completely safe balcony like view. Have bars and everything. Pay 30 HRK, climb up by elevator, put away your coat, order Josi\u0107 Rose, sit back & relax!",
          "If you travel and you are first time in Zagreb you should visit it, view on the city is ok, nothing spectacular but be sure to visit it. If you are local, i dont recommend it, after you pay entrance, you expect something, at least good coffe, or good choice of vines, no!, that",
          "I was up the observation deck on 16.05., my first day in Croatia. I paid 30 kuna (4 euros) for the entrance. As I came around 9pm, it was already getting dark, but the view has still been pretty impressive, although it might be better during the day. The drinks in the cafe are",
          "This was actually the last thing I did before leaving Zagreb, and found it to be an enjoyable experience. Yes, the views are obscured by bars, and it isn't the tallest building in Zagreb. Having said that, it provides a view that I wouldn't have seen otherwise, and as far as",
          "There are some great views to catch of the main square from this place, but it's a small/narrow balcony that wraps around. We just expected a bigger place for viewing, but not bad and definitely some great views of Zagreb.",
          "We went there after exhausting rushing around the city - and that was really brilliant idea! We were provided with binoculars, ordered some cold drinks. I was a bit surprised by stuff - they were really friendly and helpful. For example, one girl came and told us interesting",
          "The view is very nice and you can see far around. The bar on the top is also nice and can be recommended.",
          "We were given complimentary tickets. I have to say had I paid I would have been disappointed. With the exception of the view of the main square better views can be taken from either hill. The was quite an attempt to up sell which put us off stopping and having a drink in the",
          "Nice place for travelers with a sky bar on top of the roof. Quite an individual service, not too expensive. Can be a good starting or finishing point when you are in Zagreb.",
          "The staff downstairs were friendly and pleasant, the cost was \u00a33 per person and there is a restaurant on top for food or drinks only. The lady who met us on top was huffy and prissy and we complained about her attitude. Shame really. The view was breath taking though, you can",
          "We finished our tour of Zagreb by getting a birds eye view from the Zagreb eye. There is a terrific all round view of the city finished off by a nice beer in the bar overlooking Trg bana Jela\u010di\u0107a.",
          "Yes it's 16 floors up and offers a good view of low rise Zagreb, but you should know that the entire view us obstructed by prison like steel bars. This obstructed photography and the enjoyment. Management should mention this instead of giving the impression that the view is",
          "Zagreb Eye is also the observatory tower in the lower square, just around Jelacic Square. You need to pay an entrance fee and can enjoy some drinks at the top. It's not really tall, as the tallest building in the city is unaccessible (near the botanic gardens). The railings also",
          "It's on the 16th floor of a building and you see Zagreb in front of you. The pictures you take do not do the memory justice of seeing this view. They have a cute bar at the top and also have Ludo boards scattered around. Recommend a visit to this place.",
          "You have a great view of Zagreb from this place. It will cost you about 4 euros to enter though. It's also a nice bar with very friendly staff. Well worth a visit especially on a sunny day!",
          "Visit the Zagreb Eye observation deck for the best views of the entire city. You can find the elevator by entering through the bank -- go to the 16th floor. Once there you will pay 4 EUR for an adult ticket, but it is certainly worth it.",
          "Great place to enjoy the city from the top and drink a cup of mini Croatian coffee :)Friendly staff, almost 360 ;) I can totally recommend this place closer to the end of the trip, when you already have the first impression.",
          "If you want to enjoy in the view which Zagreb offers, then you have to go on the Zagreb eye. You need to look at day and night and you will not regret it.",
          "Yes you are paying to go up in an escalator but 4 euro isn't exactly a lot compared to what other cities in Europe charge for their tall buildings access. And it does provide a good overview of the city ( on three sides ) and the bar prices aren't a rip off so why not just enjoy",
          "This observation viewpoint is a must to get a great perspective of the city of Zagreb. Enjoy a snack and a drink while you take in the sights.",
          "The view was awesome! Everything else is a big -. For a usually very cheap country. This was overpriced by far, with nothing to offer except the view.",
          "I was really excited to get to see Zagreb from this high up. I love the inside of the Zagreb Eye, it has a small coffee place or a restaurant, games and seats. The atmosphere seemed really cozy and relaxed, and it's decorated really well, but the outside... i thought it's a",
          "This is the most beautifullllll place in Zagreb. You just have to visit eye... it's amazing , the view is magnificent.",
          "I have seen a lot of negative reviews, don't be put off. It is only 16 floors up but you still get a good view of Zagreb and surrounding area. There is a bar so you can just chill and have a drink, the viewing area outside is enclose (of course it is you're 16 stories up) but",
          "It doesn't cost much to go up here and the views are beautiful. You can go up in the night as well with the same ticket so well worth it.",
          "Was a really nice view of the entire city and combined with a cup of coffee - it was really too perfect. Loved the view and the staff was really nice and everything put together I just can't not leave a comment of praise for this lovely location. Of course, if you're scared of",
          "We went to Zagreb 360 (Zagreb Eye) with our friends who live in Zagreb. The place offers \"almost\" 360 degrees view over Zagreb, and in this center of town area, it is the highest point of the city. The coffee shop where you come in on the 16th floor is also very well appointed",
          "Well worth a visit. Not expensive. We took some lovely photos. The first time we went it was closed for a private function, so if you only have a few days in Zagreb check it out asap.",
          "Been here once only and I can say all the best. From the service to the view, nothing to complain about tbh.",
          "We went up when it's already dark. It is so amazing to see Zagreb glowing at night. What is nice is that you can almost see the whole city for you can actually walk almost around the building where the viewpoint is located.",
          "Basically, a very high building having the top floor converted to an observatory platform. The is a nice cafe at the top and seats and board games you can play with the kids as you have a little rest. Recommended at the very beginning or end of your time in Zagreb. Note that",
          "One of the places in Zagreb that are not to be missed!!! There is a minimal entry fee of 30 KN, but it is worth every penny! The place offers excellent 360\u00b0 view of the city, you can see all landmarks in the area and make fantastic pictures. On the walls there are big posters",
          "Zagreb eye is just amazing opportunity to see every bit of Zagreb from the sky. It has 360 degrees on the highest floor of the building. It's really breath-taking. I am from Zagreb and I was taken away by the beauty of my city. On the floor there is also a modern coffee place",
          "No we ain't going to talk (at least not in this review) about 1982 single hit song from Rocky 3 by Survivor ( what is by the way one of the all time classics)we are going to talk about \"Zagreb eye\".As you know if you like to travel (or not but something other brings you in this",
          "I went with a friend for coffee and didn't realize there is a cover charge during the day! The view is nice, but it's just a tiny little walkway and you can't really sit and enjoy the view. The atmosphere is a bit stiff, too.",
          "If you're at the main city square then don't miss this one. It has a cool coffee shop at the top floor.",
          "We visited here on our first full day in Zagreb and while it is nice to get a view of the city, it's not great for very much other than finding your bearings. If it's your first day in the city and you're happy to spend 30kuna per adult on getting an ariel view of the city or",
          "One of the best if not the best sightseeing place in zagreb. 360 view is available at top of this high building. There is coffe bar at top and you can enjoy your morning coffe or evening drink with beautiful view on main square ban jelacic",
          "Gorgeous view, kind service and good smooth music background. Really a good idea for a relaxing pit stop during your visit. Advice: Do not miss it! ;)",
          "Fantastic when we where there there was a concert you can play board games and drink a lot of drinks.You can see whole town",
          "only costs \u00a32 to enter the observation deck and you are allowed to return again in the same day, perfect for day/night photos. staff are really friendly. I get the feeling this attraction either isn't well known or not particular popular with locals but we really enjoyed it!",
          "The Christmas market in Zagreb is worth to visit. There are more than 5 different markets all with their own charme. A lot of guests were there, only the foogy days and temperatures between + 2 and 0\u00b0C were not so nice.",
          "Great spot for photos, as it gives you an aerial view of the city. You are required to pay an entrance fee. Steep stairs to the top.",
          "Excuse me Zagreb, but what is this?People are paying for escalator ? This view on main square and nothing more... It is nice to have a bar or club up there, but if you what to charge for view you need to have stunning view. And here is not",
          "My daughter loves to visit this place, right above the main square in downtown Zagreb. There's a cafe bar where you can sit and look out over the ZG skyline. Entrance to the Eye is about $6 per person.",
          "As a citizen, I can say that there is no enough panorama view of our beautiful city. This is more likely the best because its 360 degreese view, but the bars really ruined impression for me. Good thing is that you buy a daily ticket so I recomand everybody to go by day, a step",
          "Situated on the last floor of a building in the very hearth of Zagreb, it offers an excellent view of the city and its attractions. A must during the Christmas period.",
          "Great place to hang out with friends! There's a wonderful view of the city center. You can also play board games! It has a modern feel and relaxed atmosphere!",
          "We went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was a really nicely place to have a bottle of champagne while looking over the city. Central Zagreb is small, but the city stretches out surprisingly far! Of course, you have to try to find the landmarks, such as the golden",
          "This is a great site to take a picture of the City of Zagreb. It gives a 360 degree view of city with a perfect view of most the big attractions. We paid 20 kn each for access to the bar and overview. There is free wifi and heat/ac. The pass last all day just in case you",
          "Great experience. Nice view. Excellent coffee & chocolate! You can play '\u010covje\u010de ne ljuti se!' Game.. :)",
          "Tea was thoroughly mediocre, but the view over the old town can not be beaten (especially as you can't see the tower itself from the observation deck!), and I do find it so helpful in an unfamiliar city to get a good vantage point before exploring. I'm certainly glad we decided",
          "Old part of zagreb . Zagreb is not big city bat you can see a lot of things in zagreb zagreb eye is place where you can see all zagreb from old part of zagreb",
          "This is waste of both time and money. Bars are on every 2 cm, you could not get a clear picture. Everything looks like prison. Avoid it. Better look the city from the Upper Town.",
          "Bad vine, bad furniture, better view at belvedere tower, no ice for the four cocktails you could offer, but as we've been informed, people drink it whiteout ice, why should the buy ice cubes... The staff doesn't really work.",
          "Beautiful view, friendly girls on entrance, good Coffee, waiter is friendly and kind but toooooooooooooo slow. Ambient is also very fine with good choice of music.",
          "I enjoyed a fabulous sunset from the rooftop of the very central zagreb eye. all the staff was extraordinary friendly: the lift girl, the receptionist and the waiter. sitting on a comfortable couch, I gazed over the skyline and slurped a deliciously creamy cafe latte. only",
          "The Zagreb Eye isn't terribly high up (16 stories), but it's the tallest building in the city center. The views are quite good, and it's a great opportunity to get a different perspective of the city. The attraction isn't expensive - just a few dollars. You can also enjoy a",
          "I visited Zagreb in late September and this was one of the places we wanted to experience. The fee was unexpected, but worth the price. We were only there at night, and the view was beautiful, wish we had gone during the day as well. But our stay in Zagreb was short and there",
          "Go up during the day to get oriented and then return at sunset for the same ticket and see the city be transformed by night.",
          "Best view by day, best view by night. You can also organize an event at the venue or even a wedding dinner. There is also a bar with a champagne.",
          "Very cheap to visit, and your ticket is valid all day. We returned after sunset to see Zagreb at night too. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "After you done with ur daily walking or shoping in Zagreb or something else you ve been doing, i would recommend you to go visit zagreb eye. I thing it 16th floor but there is always someone to help you. Grab a cup of coffee and enjoy ur view :)",
          "What can I say that others haven't? The view is stunning. The ticket price allows you to go up again in the evening which is great. The staff are friendly and not pushy. The drinks are cheap and not overpriced. The view is spectacular day or night. Bring your camera and",
          "Great view, good beer ... what more could one want? It actually gives a better perspective on the city than the bell tower. It costs a little, but one can leave and return later. The only downsides, imo, are that they allow smoking and there are bars which make taking pictures a",
          "Really cool to see zagreb from above and you can reuse the ticket to go up again at night for example. Inside very chilly mood with comfortable seats and several games. The staff isnt pushing you to buy drinks which is nice.",
          "Worth to go up. No reservation needed. They serve drinks upstairs; it is not free of charge and not included in the ticket. Fantastic view all around, don`t forget to bring your camera! They have toys for kids, but they do not tolerate if a child is yelling, screaming or",
          "Need to say more? Situated in the heart of the city... For just 20Kn, \u20ac4, you are up high, with bar and relax area!! relaxindrelaxing area. I love it!",
          "This is probably a good first stop in Zagreb. The orientation platform, located on the 16th floor of \u201cZagreb neboder\u201d (Zagreb skyscraper), gives you a great view at the entire city and its surroundings. The skyscraper was built in 1959, as a first business building in the",
          "To see the whole city from a bird-eye view you should visit this place. Ticked is available during a day, so you can visit several times. I visited in the morning and evening. There is a bar and good drinks also. You can take nice photos and enjoy the high view to the central",
          "Great view of Zagreb and surrounding areas, it is 20 kuna well spent. The vertical bars are somewhat distracting but don't take away fro the view or the ability to take photos. Ticket lasts the whole day so you can coma and go as you please. Small but good bar at the top so we",
          "For 80 kuna (app. \u20ac 12.-) for 4 persons cheap entry. Nice view of Zagreb, not too spectaculair though. When we went very friendly girl acted as sort of hostess. Bar serves good enough coffee. Not a must see but still nice to visit.",
          "Beautiful view, well worth a little walk to see, and just by the Museum of Broken Relationships (also a must see). Zagreb is such a massive, diverse city, and you see it all from up here.",
          "Very friendly girl on reception, apologised because a group of children were there but did not concern us. Good value because the ticket allowed you to return as often as you liked and was open until very late.Fast lift to the top.",
          "What a waste of 20 kuna. The view is just OK and there are bars blocking any photos. Not worth your time. Walk around instead.",
          "Fantastic views and very friendly. But a ticket during the day and come back for a cocktail and the sunset at night for the same ticket price.",
          "You can see the entire city from atop this area. It is a uphill walk so be in shape or take a local taxi.",
          "Centrally located it offers good views from above of the main attractions. There is a safety rail all around the tower which does affect the ability to take photos a little. At only \u00a32 it is great value and you can go back anytime the same day, so you could view in daylight and",
          "We have to take a small walk form the Central but it is worth visiting. you can also use the tram to reach there",
          "First time we have visited this attraction this year after 6 times in Zagreb and we were surprised. The view from the top floor is amazing you can see each side of the city. Ticket is ok for the whole day so come here in the morning or daytime and come back at night to see the",
          "Excellent customer service; in particular, the lovely Maja who took the time to talk us through the key points to visit in the city as well as other places in Croatia. The way she seductively sucked on her coconut juice was a little distracting. The atmosphere at the bar was",
          "A very nice place to visit in order to see Zagreb from above. I liked that there is an enclosed area with a cafe, puff chairs and board games, which makes the visit really pleasant. The tickets are valid the whole day and you can come back if you want to. Staff is very friendly.",
          "Super nice! Beautiful view and kind waitress! We enjoy a lot! My friends and I had fun playing with the different table game!",
          "Have seen this advertised all week so decided to go with friends, has amazing views however there are bars all over the place so view is very disrupted, I realise this is a safety precaution however something like glass or mesh would be a lot better, it makes taking photos very",
          "A good chance to overview Zagreb..There is a caf\u00e9 up there and a good relaxed atmosphere and a good attraction for an hour..",
          "Beautiful view, and instead of crowd like in another viewpoints, here you can seat down, relax and enjoy the perfect view of the city with a drink. You can come up with the same ticket at daytime and also in the evening at the same day. Polite and helpful staff, I suggest it to",
          "This place is such good value and even the coffee is good value. They do not rip you off. Your ticket allows you up the tower as much as you want. The staff were super friendly and made you feel like you've just entered their living room. The views are great except limited",
          "Maybe interesting to know it was suicide tower or zagreb die point before it become romantic eye point. Not so popular for jumps in that time as it is for exchanging kisses today. But offcourse they charge today, times they are a changing. Today you have to pay even to have a",
          "We went up at night for drinks and a good view of the city. It's only 20 kuna to go up, and there is good indoor and outdoor seating up top that wraps around the building so you can see all of Zagreb. The drinks weren't cheap but weren't very expensive either - worth the view.",
          "Wonderful atmosphere and very kind hosts. Plus a beautiful view on Zagreb. Go there, take a beer and relax.",
          "Great views across the city. A good way to get your bareings while enjoying a few cocktails served by the friendly staff which are always happy to point you in the right direction of other attractions.",
          "There are two places in Zagreb that you can go up to have a great view of the city. This is the one by the main square. It costs 20 kuna each to go up\u2026 Very nice view from there.",
          "the view is so good, the staffs were really friendly and helpful. should visit in the beginning of your stay in Zagreb",
          "The signs can be a bit deceiving...the tower with the 360 degree view says free admission, but that is just to get into the lower floors. The quick elevator up about 20 stories will cost you 20 kuna each (about $2.80 each) but the views are spectacular, the wifi is free, and",
          "The views where beautiful at the top but not as beautiful as the blonde women that works there . She was so welcoming and was always on the go going from person to person . To make sure everyone was having a good time . My time in Zagreb I thought the customer service was quiet",
          "The Zagreb Eye is right next to the main square in the city and offers a great panoramic view of the city. It was also a nice reprieve from the weather, included wifi, and had a nice lounging area to enjoy drinks. The tickets were inexpensive and were valid all day.",
          "Tall building with a very nice view of Zagreb and low ticket price (ticket is valid for whole day, so you can come back in the evening). There is also wifi and good beer to be had.",
          "Nice place whit a panoramic view of the city, nearby are some nice coffees and small shops with souvenirs.",
          "You can see all the city from there. Maybe not 360 degrees but only 330 :D You can order a beer there or other drink, there is no food unfortunately. It costs 20KN.",
          "Right across from main square, Jelacicev Trg, great place to take a break from touring and look out over the city. Reasonably priced beers and comfortable chairs with wooden Trouble/Ludo games set out. Our daughter loved it, and also cool on a hot day. The small admission",
          "Went on the Zagreb Eye one evening. You do pay to get in, but the views are lovely. Had a drink and played a game! Very relaxing.",
          "If you don't mind paying the entry fee, this is a really quick and convenient way to get a 360 degree view of the city. It's not the best for photos since you've got to deal with bars. Chill spot and wasn't too busy.",
          "The view from the top was beautiful and it was only 20kn to go up also with your ticket you could return at any point during the day. Me and my friend went up in the afternoon and again for the sunset beautiful photos!",
          "The place is nice, the view is not amazing or with the \"wow\" affect but it is nice, the location is very good, near all the other sites. At 12:00 they have the cannon firing and that is the best thing at Zagreb Eye.",
          "was highly reviewed, so we went to see, but except for the plaza and cathedral the view was pretty monotonous",
          "Waitress was very helpful and introduced the place very well. With cheap price you get an excellent view!",

          "If you've spare 40-odd minutes I'd recommend zooming up the 16 floors & taking in the panorama. It's seriously high & affords you a vertiginous view of Zagreb & copious photo opportunities. The experience is let down somewhat by the facilities up there however. Ostensibly a bar,",
          "A quick tip: when you go on trips, do not have high expectations. I went with my friends to the \"eye\" and spend there around 90 minutes. We enjoyed the view from the 16th floor.",
          "Nice, nice to see!!! Very high up!!! Nice to see the world like this (crazy how nature do this). Can play game look chess many colour good",
          "For a small fee (10 kuna with the Zagreb card), you can go to viewing platform however many times you want in a day. We went in the morning to buy our Zagreb card and then came back in the evening to watch the sunset and overlook the performances in the square.",
          "The Zagreb Eye was great to go up and see the views. You get a lift up to the top of an office block and go inside for 20kn. The views were great and it was a really cool place to just chill out at the top. You can walk around the outside bit to see all around Zagreb. There's",
          "We weren't too sure what to expect based on the title here, but to clarify, it's essentially a lift to the top of a tall building in the centre of Zagreb. Although that doesn't sound too amazing, when you get to the top, the views are spectacular, also, the entry fee was only \u00a32",
          "We thought the evening scene with the bar would be special so we returned at the end of the day. Dead. During the day, the families seemed to enjoy the view and activity.",
          "very beautiful view of Zagreb. While you walk in the upper town just come and enjoy the view. Its worth it",

          "Good views. Decided to go at night to see the view in the dark but could have gone in the day and re-used the ticket in the evening. Very attentive staff at the top. You catch lift up and pay when you get out at the top.",
          "Zagrebeye is one of newer attractions in Zagreb, located on the top floor of skyscraper on the main city square. It was a bit difficult to find entrance at first, but luckily there were promoters who will show you the way. Ticket was 20kn per person, and it takes short elevator",
          "Really nice view of the city. Good that there are no windows so you can take beatiful pictures. A shame they don't have a student discount though...",
          "Host is nice enough to charge us only 10Kuna as students from London. They usually only accept erasmus exchange students for discounts :) Nice bar, nice place to chill and nice view!:D",
          "Was surprised to read poor reviews of this place . Came across by accident ( saw local advert) and visited in morning for great views over the city. We're told we could return as oft as wanted during day on same \u00a32 ticket. Went back in evening to enjoy cocktails, good music,",
          "The Zagreb Eye is a comfortable lounge atop a 16-story office building on Jelacik Square. It is not a ferris wheel like the London Eye. It offers a pleasant 360-degree view of the city. The entrance to the Eye is not well-marked. There are three elevators in the lobby of the",
          "As Zagreb is my hometown, I expected little from visiting this venue (you know how it goes, commoners know everything). Well, imagine my surprise. This viewpoint offers really beautiful view, you'll enjoy watching Zagreb from all angles. It's safe to bring children since there",

          "Hard to find as wasn't clear what the Zagreb eye was. It's basically a tall office block with a funky bar at the top. It's has some lovely views. Not the best tower I've been up but a fun and cheap place to have a drink. Roughly \u00a32 a person entry.",

          "With the railings, it is not great for photos or selfies.",
          "It's good but not a must go. City views from the upper town are much better.",
          "Good place to have a drink with city view.",
          "Not worth the money even though the view is in fact the best you can have from a high tower. They promise a discount card which is no longer accepted by most of the announced places. Staff is nice and do their best to make you feel good. When informed about wrong publicity they blame it all on the management...",
          "Great place to get a bird's eye view of the old town. Especially spectacular view in the night with  the lightings on the monuments. Also, you can enjoy a cold beer /hot coffee at the cafe in the observation deck",
          "Beautiful views & a nice bar where you can grab a drink",
          "Inexpensive to go up - and then lovely views of the city in a narrow outdoor passage that surrounds a cafe/bar. The whole thing opens up on warm sunny days I guess. Worth a visit.",
          "Great place in heart of Zagreb. For those who want to see one of the best panorama of Zagreb a must visit.",
          "Good views over the city, worth having a look x",
          "Cool place to get a 360 view of Zagreb.  The admission price is inexpensive and once you pay you can go in and out as many times as you want throughout the day.  With that in mind you can go during the day and take pictures and then go back \u2026",
          "Rather expensive and better views and overall experience at Lotrscak Tower",
          "Great place with spectacular view where you can organize party with catering.",
          "Awesome place!",
          "I don't care what they call this, it's a rooftop bar. Decent prices. Great view. Strict bouncer who won't let you take your drink out to the caged viewing area, but that's alright. They have a video screen which plays MTV music videos \u2026",
          "The view is nice, a bit expensive to go up but drinks are quite cheap. I'm giving 2 stars because of the guy working at the bar. He was rude for no reason.",
          "Great city views. I really should have planned to enjoy a coffee while here but failed to really look in to what this place was. It\u2019s way more than an observation deck. Failure on my part.",
          "Amazing view! One can take breathe taking photos if it was not for the bars that surround the view. Minus 1 star for the bears.",
          "Great to see a panoramic of the city.",
          "Nice views, nice and cheap coffee!",
          "Amazing view, stay to have a drink in the restaurant to make the 60kn/person worth your whil. A quite comprehensive city guide was also included in the entrance fee. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and the friendly service.",
          "Zagreb is such a lovely city!",
          "Amazing view over Zagreb, excellent service and Renata is the best waitress and she makes the best coffee. The ambient is amazing and very pretty.",
          "It was nice and quiet when we went, which was perfect. Staff are very helpful. Nice atmosphere to enjoy a few drinks and take in the views of Zagreb!",
          "Most people go for the view but end up ordering something. View is obstructed by thick metal bars which should ideally be replaced with glass to enhance the experience. Bar is decently priced and coffee was good and hence the 3 stars.",
          "its alright, i wouldn't go there again, during weekend no chance you will get seating , crowd was not friendly at all and staff was all about making money  \ud83e\udd23",
          "Big bars in the way of a truly panoramic view",
          "A really nice place to be and drink something, the problem is that the waiter is just rude and the bathtooms got a sing to indicate \"Man\" and \"Woman\" that is really disrespectful. \n\nThey deserve to close or being sanctionated.",
          "The 16th floor restaurant is nice and cosy, but the terrace is very very narrow and it is surrounded by bars, which stole the beauty of the panoramic view.",
          "Stunning views of the city.",
          "I loved it here!  The bartender was incredible and suggested great wine. Wifi and what a view. Oh, and they stamp your hand if you want to come back later in the day.",
          "The bars around the outside make it bad for selfies, (which directly conflicts their marketing) but you can stick your arm between them and get a picture of the view that way. Narrow walkway, full of smoking teenagers.",
          "A real observation deck surrounding a nice caf\u00e9 full of boardgames. I recommend to do it with the ZagrebCard (fee of 60HRK to enter otherwise)",
          "Nice and windy outside with great viewpoint, but very pleasant interior for having a rest and some drink..",
          "Very good way to take in the whole city uninterrupted views. Price includes access all day",
          "The best panaromic views of Zagreb and you can visit free Everytime if you make a card",
          "The least favourite place to visit in my book, and I have quite a few places notched there. The staff varies from okay to rude, the price of admission was 20 kn the last time I visited, and I'd say that's about optimal for what the site can \u2026",
          "Zagreb was my least favorite city in an otherwise amazing country. If you\u2019re there, do this. It was worthwhile.",
          "Awesome view. A bit mesmerising.",
          "Great place to see Zagreb. A bit harder to take a photo couse of the fence arround, but the view is just fantastic..",
          "Good view, you can see while of the city and enjoy a nice cup of coffee too.",
          "You see almost see the whole city! Greatly approved",
          "Great view from the top! Entrance fee is 60 HRK",
          "they show it like you could actually take photos of yourself with the view there (like its a window) but they have poles all over so you barely can take pictures, 60 kunas for nothing, very dissappointed place",
          "Really nice view, especially during the sunset! Nice atmosphere and the staff was friendly as well! The price for going up is moderate, I would do it again!",
          "A very quaint place although a bit misleading maybe. The 360 observation deck is actually a bar with an almost 360 view of zagreb. There is no deck, there is no platform but still you can get a really nice view of the whole city.\n\nThe \u2026",
          "Bought this as part of funicular & castle ticket. Great views, lots of info available. No lift to get to top, would think twice about taking small people to top.",
          "Nice place to see Zagreb from above. Safety is high. 100kn/13\u20ac ticket. They organize events as well.",
          "Awesome view of zagreb",
          "Nothing  much except the view, cant bring your drinks outside",
          "Nice place with great view over Zagreb! It is the 2nd tallest building in Zagreb(according to receptionist, and there aren\u2019t that many tall buildings anyways) and it indeed offer great view over the city. There is a bar on top and was very reasonable priced. Great place to chill.",
          "Defently worth passing by if you have Zagreb Card",
          "Lovely roomy cafe with great views and very comfy armchairs and games tables. If you get a Zagreb Card it's free entrance so we used it often.",
          "Good for a pleasant drink with a view",
          "Yes you have a very beautiful sight but you have protection all around and it's not the best to take good pictures or enjoy the view. Plus it's 8\u20ac juste to take an elevator. So I recommend you to go Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower, less expensive and no protection all around.",
          "If you are interested to support a business which thinks that women are second place citizens, this is the place for you!",
          "The view is awesome. The drinks are good and inexpensive. You have to pay 8\u20ac for a Zagreb card to enter the building but the card is for multiple entrance and valid until 31Jan 2018 and you will have a 20% discount for some museums and 10% for 1 restaurant and so on.",
          "This is kinda luxurious place in Zagreb center as we experienced. 8\u20ac for going to the balcony and watch the whole city. The lounge is the cafeteria. It was well conditioned and warm in winter. Tea and caf\u00e9 are ok. Prices are around 2\u20ac.\n\nI \u2026",
          "Perfect place for photo \ud83d\udcf7",
          "Great little secret, go first thing, not so busy then. At midday they shoot one shot of the cannon",
          "It's ok. Thought it was higher. Lots of people smoking and drinking on top.",
          "Cool view of the city. Everything safely fenced off, so it's ok to bring young kids up there. Admittance 30 kuna per person. Lovely bar at the top, drinks not too pricey. Board games available.",
          "Very expensive for what they offer... The view is nice, though.",
          "Too funny... a fixed pair of binoculars... however great view and just part of walking this beautiful city...cobblestone streets, museums and much to do.",
          "Love this city",
          "Nice place and view, but in my opinion ticket is to expensive.",
          "Love the view, the entrance fee is a bit pricey",
          "If you weren't been in Zagreb before, I suggest to go firstly here, because you can see the city from birds perspective, maybe to catch a sunrise or sunset. There is a entrance I think max. 10 euro depends if you are student/under \u2026",
          "This definitely had great views. I recommend going here first to get a good view of the whole city and also because your entrance gets you a Zagreb card that gives you discounted museum tickets and some food places. We went to the wine and \u2026",
          "One of the best panoramas of Zagreb",
          "Great view, but the fence around the floor is a big obstacle for serious photography. You will not be able to use a tripod and even big lens will not fit the fence width. Smart phone photography is ok, but no tripod.",
          "Gives a good amount of view of the entire city and its highlights.",
          "Awesome view of Zagreb!! Amazing sunset..",
          "It's a nice place to view the whole city and hang out. They have a lounge where you can hang out, grab a drink, or play games. When you buy the tickets, you get a stamp that grants you all day access. I went in the morning and again at night",
          "Not worth it. Rip off for a view of bars!",
          "Nothing in comparison with similar concepts in other cities. Downright disappointed. Not at all special. No cocktail menu. Would have been better in a good local pub.",
          "Really goof spot to have a 360 view of the city.\nI believe the price was fair 30kn for a day and night view.\nDrinks at the bar were good with fair prices",
          "Wonderful views of the city of Zagreb, can't miss it!! There's also a Bar where you can drink your favorite beverage while you enjoy the view..",
          "You can bring  food in!",
          "Good music. Cosy chairs and stunning view",
          "Great view (although you can't walk exactly 360\u00b0), but a bit expensive.",
          "Good view to complete whole Zagreb, cosy bar on top with good espresso and friendly staff. The entrance fee is for my opinion a little to high compared what you get for it.",
          "Fabulous!",
          "It's not really a 360\u00b0 view and it's too expensive, not worthy. You are able to see the whole city but behind bars, the security bars are so big and thick that actually ruin the view. Also I think is quite expensive for just going to a 16 floor... Not worthy",
          "Plenty of beautiful churches",
          "Good views of Zagreb but it's not 360\u00b0 as one side is not part of the viewing deck. Bar at the top and you can get a stamp to be able to go back up later on in the day, so you can see Zagreb in the day and at sunset etc. Possibly a bit expensive for what it is but with the possibility of going back up it's not too bad.",
          "A great place to get a view of th whole city.",
          "Nice view. They do have a bar and offer drinks. Not much if expecting more.",
          "Great view and great cocktails! Gorgeous during the day and at night time!",
          "We stayed in Zagreb for one night so didn't get the full feel of the place but we loved it. The bar was lovely and the staff spoke brilliant English and were very helpful (they helped me chose a Croatian beer that I then drank for most of \u2026",
          "Nice view over the city. Bars on the fence make it a little bit hard to take nice photos. I think they should include one free drink to the entrance fee, that would make it more justified. But still nice place to visit.",
          "Good place for a panoramic view of Zagreb from the center of old town while sipping your favourite drink.",
          "Definitly worth its money, not only do you get a great view, it is also a pleasant place for a drink if you'd like to rest up",
          "Sightseeing place with observation desk in the center of the city. There is a bar there with coffee, tea and alcohol drinks with good service. They rent this place for private and public events. Observation desk gives you rare opportunity to view half of the city from birds perspective. Would recommend to anyone - turist or local.",
          "You get some great views of the city from up here. The entrance was a little difficult to find -- you have to walk through a bank. But once you're on top enjoy the views, have a cappuccino and relax. If they tear the bars down I will give the next review a 5.",
          "Nice view on Zagreb. Drinks are not that expensive. You can sit there relax and play games while enjoying the view.",
          "Not a 360 view. More like 270 lol. Not really worth the money",
          "Possibly a scam. The admission fee for us was $60 Kuna per person. But reading review (after we paid) there's a review from just only 2 weeks ago that suggested a $30/person admission fee.\n\nSo am not really sure, maybe they charge different \u2026",
          "The viewpoint is really nice, but they've just doubled the entrance fee. Which makes it impossible for us locals to enjoy it more often, or to have a drink up there from time to time. Thanks for that :(",
          "It's an underwhelming experience. Would skip it if you have other plans.",
          "Peaceful place to drink coffe and study",
          "The view of the city is great from there.",
          "Amazing view, cozy place to grab a drink.",
          "Phantastik view and good drinks.",
          "A place that gives special prizes to women as woman's day gifts as long as they come in with an adult male chaperon.",
          "Great viewing. Nice cocktail bar and extremely pleasant staff.",
          "Great view.",
          "Waste of time and money\n\nThe entire place is closed. Its completely obstructing the city view. Nothing as per expectation.",
          "I go to high viewpoints in all the cities I visit to get a bird's eye view and do photography. This one ranks among one of the very best: there is no glass in the way meaning no bad reflections, there are bars but any lens or cell phone \u2026",
          "Love this place, boardgame with a spectacular view and, sometimes, live music!",
          "Good value and friendly staff.  Good views too!",
          "Amazing view, but expensive",
          "Super place with good view, good choice of many drinks..",
          "Beautiful view of the city, nice place to sit for a drink... you can also play \"Ludo\". Been there during the day but I bet during the night is also amazing! ",
          "Place where you can see everything in Zagreb, if you visit there you must go and look",
          "Small city and beautiful cemetery in the heart of Zagreb",
          "Expected to be on a TOP of a building.. not just going around \ud83d\ude10 they dont take \u20ac...",
          "the best place in the town if u want to take same great shots. It wort it! You also get discounts for some other attractions such as Museums and Zoo Zagreb",
          "Was expecting more of an open place with telescopes.",
          "It\u2019s nice but not worth the 8\u20ac entrance. Drinks are reasonably priced. Better to offer more expensive drinks and free entry",
          "Cool place to have a drink or coffe especially during the Christmas fair time ... Child friendly with big dash board games inside.\n\nBest view in Zagreb.",
          "Views are nice but your there for a short time for The fee I felt were high",
          "Great views",
          "Truly amazing experience! Really kind staff, great service and the view is astonishing by day as well as by night! A true tourists recommendation",
          "360 view of Zagreb. Really nice place to get a drink with an amazing view \ud83d\ude09",
          "From the top of a skyscraper you can get the best view of the entire Zagreb. Surrounded by that scene, you can drink coffee or other drinks. Prices of drinks are acceptable but you must paid entrance: 30 kn per person (almost 5 euro).",
          "If you are up for some sexist views and degrading approach in communication toward female visitors, this is for you. Not my cup of tea.",
          "Nice view of the city. Worth the visit.",
          "Good view worth to see it stuff also very friendly!",
          "Good for chilling. Not worth it for one time entry since you will pay the same for one time or a year. In the 16th floor which is not that high for observatory.",
          "Nice place",
          "Excellent views from the heart of Zagreb. Not for those afraid of heights.",
          "Not that interesting , costs 60 Kuna, 30 for students . Bars everywhere so it's hard to get a good picture (cant even get a decent selfie )\nWon't pay more than 10 kunas just to have a decent look and leave , not to talk about 30 or 60",
          "Nice view from 16th floor to see Zagreb. The cute friendly staff gave us a brief and useful introduction of Zagreb. We also enjoyed cocktails in the cafe \nwith company of live piano by a elated player. ",
          "Glad we did this great photos all round a great experience.",
          "Great view of he city relatively cheap, worth a look",
          "Very nice view. Caffe on top is small, it is nicely decorated but not worth paying entrance fee.",
          "Very comfortable place with a view of Zagreb.",
          "Great view, no doubt. But rather expensive (30kn) If you compare it to other things you can do in Zagreb. Take a bus to the mountains if you want a great view and experience.",
          "Nice view of the city center, but could be much cheaper for what it offers.",
          "Great ambience, a bit disappointed by the view (I went during sunset, but it was cloudy). Would suggest adding more games such as monopoly, chess, cards, etc.",
          "Views are not 360 as the title may suggest. I certainly wouldn't pay to go there, and the view from there is not as spectacular as it could be. It has a good sound system, and only one bar to serve drinks. There could be places for people \u2026",
          "The view is beautiful but there are lots of iron bars. So it's hard to take a picture.",
          "Although 8 euros is quite expensive, its a nice view. Bar is quite kitschy loud music friendly staff. One time expefience maybe.",
          "Great view of Zagreb! Plus a bar.",
          "Favourite place for me in Zagreb. Must to see that beautiful view. And drink their coffe it's perfect! :)",
          "Not high enough to get a good view. Walk around a narrow rain galley way, not nice. Should be free as was changed \u00a37.50.",
          " Good view. Disappointed in the prison Bars that obstruct the view. Been on much taller buildings that have less precautions. Just don't allow children.\n\n Cafe was reasonably priced. Cappuccino delicious.\n\n Restrooms clean.",
          "Nice view to all the town. Especially on sunset...",
          "Just a Bar with View.",

          "An amazing view of the city , lovely to have a sunset point with a drink , would recommend to have a night and a day view , a bar inside makes the moment more soothing and comfortable",
          "Unprofessional and discriminate women. To their PR: you guys are morons. Who did you have to f**k or pay to get a job?",
          "The views was obstructed by a big fence. However inside is nice to chill and have a rest. Only worth a visit if you have the Zagreb card. ",
          "Paid entry of 30kuna each as we wanted to go up for a coffee , went around the top to take a few photos waited for over 5 min for someone to serve us for a coffee.... no one came... we left, it's not worth the money in my opinion.",
          "Great view, nice bar.",
          "Friendly staff.\nGreat place to relax with a view",
          "For only 30 kn, you can revisit this location throughout the day. The drinks are a bit more expensive but not overly expensive. you get a great view and entertainment with your drink ",
          "Good views. The bars are a bit inconvenient.",
          "Great place to have some drinks and enjoy the view of this beautiful city! Affordable prices as well! Entry fee is around $3",
          "Great place to get a great view. It's a shame they close so early and there aren't food options.",
          "Don't waste money... It is not worth even zero stars..",

          "Beautiful views of the City of Zagreb. Great on a clear day.",
          "Nice view, the entrance fee of 30kn per person is okay, the prices in the caf\u00e9 are fair. 8kn for coffee and 35kn for a cocktail. Worth a visit! ",
          "Best view of the city, you can see the whole thing from up there. Also played an epic game of \u010covje\u010de ne ljuti se up there, tales are still told about the roll I went on with my blue figure guy. If not they should start talking about it because that was epic.",
          "You call this an observation deck?? Shame.",
          "50 kunas just for entry... and its not a 360 view... pretty average, nothing special",

          "One of the best places in Zagreb",
          "nice place. try to plan to come after noon and at dawn. night is nice not more then that",
          "Great wiew! Cosy caffe but since you need to pay for entrance (30kn) you don't have obligation to order. You can just spend some time here.",
          "Everything is modern and nice, but the prices are just absurd",
          "Good place to get some aerial shots but the cafe inside isn't anything special. Could be better value for 30 kuna",
          "Good to taste the atmosphere of Zagreb Advent from the air",
          "Great view but the iron bars obstructing it are a deal breaker for me. This experience could have been so much better. What a shame.",
          "Very interesting",
          "Nice place, but it\u2019s not worth 20\u20ac for a whole family, luckily we had the Zagreb Pass so we could enter for free!",
          "Beautiful views",
          "nice place, kind people, you can go there and watch out over the hole city and then play some rounds dont be angry! Funny place, my friend and i had fun.",
          "Great view. They offer a card you can use at other partner venues for discounts as well.",
          "The views are the best you will find of the city. The atmosphere was a bit cheesey, but everyone was friendly and it was comfortable.",

        "wiki": "Zagreb (; Croatian pronunciation: [z\u01ce\u02d0\u0261reb] (listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level. \nThe estimated population of the city in 2018 was 820,678. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,086,528, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's \u0160\u010ditarjevo. The name \"Zagreb\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf.\nZagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of them are at a low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.\nThe name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum. \nThe older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson.\nAn even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century).\nFor this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D\u00e9csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr\u0119b\u044a which means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatian br\u0207g < Proto-Slavic *berg\u044a, which also means '(smaller) hill', and za br\u0207g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag \u2013 modified from assumed *Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony? \u2013, mentioned above.) An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr\u0119b\u044a is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\"\nbut according to D\u00e9csy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram.\n\nIn Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as  Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri\u010d (Gradec)).\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb  za-grab-, meaning  \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation \nties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka\u017eoti\u0107 (c. 1260\u20131323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.\nIn another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water from Mandu\u0161evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\"Scoop, Manda!\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now \u0160\u0107itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in his honour. During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Zagreb ===\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara\u017edin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara\u017edin and Karlovac general command.\n\n\n=== 19th to mid-20th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first mayor \u2013 Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.\nThe first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\n\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri\u010d cannon is fired daily from the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east and \u010crnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta\u0161a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n=== Modern Zagreb ===\n\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb). \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb-zapad (West\nNovi Zagreb) and Novi Zagreb-istok (East Novi Zagreb)\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.During the 1991\u20131995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many.\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n=== Area and population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), but with significant continental influences and very closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris and London. Autumn in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those districts along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F).The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 \u00b0C (104.7 \u00b0F) in July 1950, and lowest was \u221227.3 \u00b0C (\u221217.1 \u00b0F) in February 1956. A temperature of \u221230.5 \u00b0C (\u221222.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\t\t\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep\u010danka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb \u2013 istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani\u0161te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4\u20138 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani\u0161te or Kajzerica.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n\nThe wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of \u0160\u0107itarjevo.\nPicturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, \u0160estine, Gra\u010dani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, \u0160estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products.\nTo the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament.\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\nThe old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of \u017dumberak-Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,325 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.1 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County. Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia.\nIn 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative centre of both.\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.\n\n\n==== City districts ====\n\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska \u010detvrt, pl. gradske \u010detvrti):\n\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.\n\n\n==== Settlements ====\n\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area \u2013 there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu\u010dko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately. There are 70 settlements in the City of Zagreb administrative area:\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandi\u0107 (BM 365 \u2013Labour and Solidarity Party). He was confirmed as mayor on 4 June 2017 (Zagreb local elections 2017, second round). Two deputy mayors (vice mayoresses) are Jelena Pavi\u010di\u0107-Vuki\u010devi\u0107 and Olivera Jurkovi\u0107-Maji\u0107.\nThe Zagreb Assembly is composed of 51 representatives.

It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the Zagreb Assembly city deputies have the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. \u2153 of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).\nIn the City of Zagreb the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a \"city with county rights\", there isn't State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).\nCity administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration.\nThe city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly).\nLocal government is organised in 17 city districts (or city borroughs) represented by City District Councils.

It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the Republic of Croatia Square, the other at Kamenita vrata, where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called Nine Views. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\nThe historical part of the city to the north of Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square is composed of the Gornji Grad and Kaptol, a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours.

The first comprises a tennis centre situated in a large tennis hall with four courts. There are 22 outdoor tennis courts with lights. The other block offers multipurpose sports facilities: apart from tennis courts, there are handball, basketball and indoor football grounds, as well as track and field facilities, a bocci ball alley and table tennis opportunities.\nRecreational swimmers can enjoy a smaller-size indoor swimming pool in Dani\u010di\u0107eva Street, and a newly opened indoor Olympic-size pool at Utrine sports centre in Novi Zagreb. Skaters can skate in the skating rink on Trg Sportova (Sports Square) and on the lake Jarun Skaters' park. Hippodrome Zagreb offers recreational horseback riding opportunities, while horse races are held every weekend during the warmer part of the year.\nThe 38,923-seat Maksimir Stadium, last 10 years under renovation, is located in Maksimir in the northeastern part of the city. The stadium is part of the immense Svetice recreational and sports complex (\u0160RC Svetice), south of the Maksimir Park. The complex covers an area of 276,440 m2 (68 acres). It is part of a significant Green Zone, which passes from Medvednica Mountains in the north toward the south. \u0160RC Svetice, together with Maksimir Park, creates an ideal connection of areas which are assigned to sport, recreation and leisure.\nThe latest larger recreational facility is Bundek, a group of two small lakes near the Sava in Novi Zagreb, surrounded by a partly forested park. The location had been used prior to the 1970s, but then went to neglect until 2006 when it was renovated.\nSome of the most notable sport clubs in Zagreb are: NK Dinamo Zagreb, KHL Medve\u0161\u010dak Zagreb, RK Zagreb, KK Cibona, KK Zagreb, KK Cedevita, NK Zagreb, HAVK Mladost and others.\nThe city hosted the 2016 Davis Cup World Group final between Croatia and Argentina.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Archdiocese of Zagreb is a metropolitan see of the Catholic Church in Croatia, serving as its religious centre. The current Archbishop is Josip Cardinal Bozani\u0107. The Catholic Church is the largest religious organisation in Zagreb, Catholicism being the predominant religion of Croatia, with over 1.1 million adherents.\nZagreb is also the Episcopal see of the Metropolitanate of Zagreb and Ljubljana of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\nIslamic religious organisation of Croatia has the see in Zagreb. Current president is Mufti Aziz Hasanovi\u0107. There used to be a mosque in the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion during World War II at the \u017drtava Fa\u0161izma Square, but it was relocated to the neighbourhood of Borovje in Pe\u0161\u010denica. Mainstream Protestant churches have also been present in Zagreb \u2013 Evangelical (Lutheran) Church and Reformed Christian (Calvinist) Church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is also present in the Zagreb neighbourhood of Jarun whereas Jehovah's Witnesses have their headquarters in Central Zagreb. In total there are around 40 non-Catholic religious organisations and denominations in Zagreb with their headquarters and places of worship across the city making it a large and diverse multicultural community.\nThere is also significant Jewish history through the Holocaust:  History of the Jews in Croatia - Wikipedia\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nImportant branches of industry are: production of electrical machines and devices, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, food and drink processing. Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe. Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor, INA, Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city.\nThe only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka burza), which is located in Eurotower, one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers.\nAccording to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at $32,185 and $27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of $18,686 and $15,758.As of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna, about \u20ac870 (Croatian average is 5,679 kuna, about \u20ac740). At the end of 2012, the average unemployment rate in Zagreb was around 9.5%.\n34% of companies in Croatia have headquarters in Zagreb, and 38.4% of the Croatian workforce works in Zagreb, including almost all banks, utility and public transport companies.Companies in Zagreb create 52% of total turnover and 60% of total profit of Croatia in 2006 as well as 35% of Croatian export and 57% of Croatian import.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Highways ====\n\nZagreb is the hub of five major Croatian highways.\nThe highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, and forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu\u010dko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.\nA3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa. It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe. Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori\u010dan border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Vara\u017edin \u2013 \u010cakovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes. The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu\u0161kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai\u0107 Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east\u2013west arteries, former Highway \"Brotherhood and Unity\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba\u010dka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.\n\n\n===== Bridges =====\nZagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are:\n\nThere are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi\u010devec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre\u0161i\u0107 (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east).\nTwo additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nPublic transportation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail.\nThe public transportation company ZET (Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\nThe national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice, H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.\nThe funicular (uspinja\u010da) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction.\nTaxi market has been liberalized in early 2018 and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n\n===== Tram network =====\n\nZagreb has an extensive tram network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30\u201350 kilometres per hour (19\u201331 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon\u010dar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T\u017dV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \"TMK 2200\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.\n\n\n===== Suburban rail network =====\n\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east\u2013west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor\u010dek was closed in the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Air traffic ====\n\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft. The airport had 2,77 millions of passengers in 2016 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers.\nZagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu\u010dko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu\u010dko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.A third, small grass airfield, Bu\u0161evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nZagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia. There are 5 public higher education institution and 9 private professional higher education schools.\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nFounded in 1669, the University of Zagreb is the oldest continuously operating university in Croatia and one of the largest and oldest universities in the Southeastern Europe. Ever since its foundation, the university has been continually growing and developing and now consists of 29 faculties, three art academies and the Croatian Studies Centre. More than 200,000 students have attained the Bachelor's degree at the university, which has also assigned 18,000 Master's and 8,000 Doctor's degrees.\nAs of 2011, the University of Zagreb is ranked among 500 Best Universities of the world by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities.\nZagreb is also the seat of two private universities: the Catholic University of Croatia and the Libertas International University; as well as numerous public and private polytechnics, colleges and higher professional schools.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nZagreb \u2013 Official website\nZagreb Tourist Board\nVisit Zagreb - Travel Guide\nZagreb Fair\nZagreb International airport",

          "The ZOO is not that big, you can see everything in about 2 hours, if you don't take too many photos. However, it is really beautiful and you don't have to walk a lot, as everything is close together. Many different animals, including lions, reptiles... Very cheap, included in",

          "the zoo is located in maksimir park,there is also dinamo zagreb stadium opposite the park. the park and zoo can be explored on same day, the zoo is small but adequate and just about right but has all the animals you will want to see except elephant",
          "This has to be the cheapest tourist attraction i have ever visited, \u00a32.36, yes, \u00a32.36. We spent 3 hours going round this wonderful little zoo. Some interesting animals and the design/set up is great. i have no idea how they run this zoo on the charge. It was a great escape from",
          "Welk its a zoo. Not a big one snd certanly not the best one, but if you like seeing animals even thought they are held in captivity it is the place you can easily spend two or three hours. Some of the animal spaces are rebuilt and new so animals are now being held in much",
          "This place is beautiful. Rather small but beautiful. Nice and colourful. Definitely visit it, especially with the kids. They\u2019ll love it.",
          "I visited here with my boyfriend whilst we were staying in the city. It was easy to find in maskimir park - we caught the tram up to the area from the centre. It had a wide variety of animals to see and luckily it was a sunny day which made the trip more enjoyable. The Zoo",
          "A small but really nice and clean Zoo in the Maksimir garden. Definitely a must visit when you go to this part of the town.",
          "Zagreb zoo is quite small, but you can spend there easily few hours. In recent year there were lots of refurbishments so there are lots of new things to see. Even there are not so many key animal species (elephants or giraffes) there are still other interesting animals to check",
          "While looking for things to do in Zagreb, i came across zagreb zoo as an attraction. Well, it was much better than expected, i ended up spending about 3 hours watching different types of animals. If you have spare time and have visited the main attractions of zagreb, then i",
          "This is such a lovely zoo! On first appearance and the very cheap cost of entry, we thought it was going to be a small zoo. But it is a very decent size, we spent a good four hours here! Lots of animals, bears, lions, monkeys etc. We have visited many zoos, including the best in",
          "The entrance was pretty cheap (30 KN) and the area seemed rather small, but I was positively surprised by the amount of animals in there. A nice place to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Greta variety of animal from all over the world, as well as native species. Very educational and a great day out. (Was very quiet even in August and ticket prices only couple of pounds.",
          "Nice place for spend 2-3 ours in Zagreb. Children will enjoy it. Advice: buy Ledo, the best Croatian ice cream with special (low) price)",
          "Great Zoo! Most bad reviews are from winter time visits. We really enjoyed this compact Zoo, it is green and animals look happy and well kept.",
          "Visited it with a group of friends from 10 - 18 years old. We had a lot of fun and we were really impressed by the number of animals in the zoo. Although it was hot and sunny, the icecream was available in the zoo as well as drinks. It took us around 3 hours to see the whole",
          "Well,they said it was one of the best zoos in Europe and maybe they meant animal friendly??? didn't see elephants or lions, tigers, etc. Don;t get me wrong....it was nice and worth it to see the Park and wander and people watch....but if you are into zoos because you want to",
          "Very cheap for what you get which is fantastic! Spent 3 hours hear amongst a range of beautiful animals! Especially loved the wide range of reptiles !",
          "I like how they updated the zoo, but still, wish they offered more inside the park than just the animals and animal shows. Like better food and drinks. This is a common problem with smaller zoos. Probably the only well kept Zoo in the entire Balkan region.",
          "Really a nice zoo set in a very lovely park. Great escape in the middle of the city. Reptile house as particularly good. Nice change from churches and tile roofs (although we enjoyed those too). Parking is available across the street but accessing it is convoluted. Google it",
          "Zagreb ZOO is quiet small but nice place for afternoon walk. Maybe the navigation signs to the ZOO could be better. We had problems to find way to the parking place. Many animals weren't in their areas in April.",
          "It was a lovely Sunday, sunny and warm- perfect for a stroll through Maksimir and visit to the ZOO. It is very clean, well organized with facilities for hygiene, food&beverage court, some shopping- all brand new and/or refurbished. New lion den and bear habitat ate also cool as",
          "Don't expect too much from Zagreb ZOO because you'll be disapointed. ZOO is very small, very green (in spring and summer) and new buildings look very good, so it could be said that is cute and it is nice 2 hour walk but it does meet his name - ZOO because there is too little",
          "The zoo is 15 minutes away of main center,good for walking and relaxation...Just ok zoo for spend little bit time...",
          "Nice quick visit, not so much opened at this time but cheap and interesting. Down side is that we have to walk a bit to get to the actual entrance as they closed the second entrance more easily accessible.",
          "Good value, only 10 kunas for my daughter and I. Initially we found empty bird aviaries so were wondering what was going on. Then, we discovered some very interesting exhibits. Reptiles and insects are excellent, tropical pavilion is great and we also enjoyed the nocturnal",
          "Compared to other zoo-s I visited this Zoo has the best reptile collection. And I'm a big fan of snakes, so I was really happy to see so many various species. We even had a chance to hold a snake (we came in the right moment). :) lions have big new place and you can observe them",
          "On our 4 days vacation we alloted 1 day to our 2 yr old daughter. A zoo treat. The zoo is 15 minutes away from main center that fares 30 to 40 kunas. At the entrance you need to walk a hundred meters more to get into the reception. The place is nice. Good for walking and",
          "One of the better zoos I've been to. If you're into that. Animals mostly seem well treated. There are many \"exotic\" animals, so it's a nice place to learn and observe. Has a new restaurant, which is nice.",
          "One of the best zoo-s in this part of Europe. Lots of animals in its natural environment. Also something new everytime we stop by.",
          "The zoo is renovating its excellent, full of animals that are taken care of, there are restaurants and cafes",
          "A Zoo/Park right in the city of Zagreb, a place to get away from it all during the week. And perfect for a family outing during the weekend. Kids love it, there is a playground nearby in the park.",
          "A lot of facilities for children and a great new restaurant. All in all a great place to spend an afternoon in town with the kids.",
          "This zoo has been recently renovated and expanded, is now a neat, animals have a nice and tidy quarters, worth a look",
          "Very compact and well designed zoo. Animals on exhibits are very accessible and the place is well kept. Clean and easy to navigate. You can cover it all in mid-pace easily in 2-3 hours and it is extremely cheap \ud83d\ude03",
          "First of all I would like to say that renovation was successful. Animals are mainly inside, as we expected for december but we still enjoyed. The thing that is highly annoying is: it was sunday. Zoo was full of kids and parents. NO place to drink or eat. Restaurant was closed.",
          "During summer and renovation it was not crowded, nor discounted prices... now after opening, they didn't keep side entrance that is same since it has parking close by.. animals are now mainly inside, a lot of them are sleeping or resting, I was expecting more explanations or",
          "I visited the zoo while it still was rebuilding therefore some animals were not available to visitors. Zoo in Zagreb has a large number of reptiles that are found in several locations. For children organize educational workshops where, the children are introduced to the animals.",
          "this is certainly not a good zoo. and this is when i was told it has been done up newly.only visit if one has nothing else to do.it has a long walk to entrance.its a big disappointment for animal lovers. half the enclosures are empty. hardly anything to eat/drink within the",
          "I was here in december and still was great We could not see al animals becouse of cold days (-2/3 celsius), and for some animals that to cold but still big numbers of animals are there Need to visit when u came to Zagreb",
          "We were very surprised how good this Zoo is. Al the animals seemed very happy and it was good to see that the Zoo is undergoing renovations. Would like to re-visit in warmer weather.",
          "The first zoo i ever visited so i had a really nice time seeing all the different animals they had there. Must see while in zagreb.",
          "Excellent grounds in a lovely setting, very cheap at only 30kn per person \u00a33.50 in UK terms. Was a bit upsetting to see some animals extremely stressed/ bored just as the big bear and hippopotamus, and lack of staff looking after the animals was apparent, Also park signage is",
          "If you spend more than one day in Zagreb you should visit ZOO Zagreb and Maksimir Park. You can see a lot of animals even it is always sad to see animals behind bars. For couples and kids is great place to spend time together and see animals which we usually don't see in live!",
          "Had a great trip to Zagreb Zoo. Great fun for small children. We specially enjoyed the 11:30 feeding of the seals.",
          "They have a large variety of animals to enjoy viewing. As a treat you can enjoy the vultures as well.",
          "This is great place to visit for famillies with young children. You can see plenty of animals from the area and from all around the world. The zoo just got two little leons...so we could see the softer side of wilderness. :-) Around the Zoo is park Maksimir...also recommend",
          "Zoo is orderly and neglected animals are found in inadequate areas Ticket prices are too high. I hope they fix it",
          "Enjoyed the zoo with my little kids. The Zoo is in a very nice location in Zagreb, next to beautiful Maksimir Park.",
          "Great family fun ,this would be 5 stars zoo but we did miss elephants.The zoo is clean and look nice after renovation.",
          "Coming from the States I wasn't sure what to expect when coming to a zoo in Croatia. I was thoroughly impressed. The animal enclosures are in great condition. The animals look healthy. The zoo was also much larger than I was expecting. I know some of the zoo is under",
          "It is not a Germany or Australia where you could expect a lot, therefore ZOO is also not a magical place, but as for Croatia is really very very good :) they planned a lot of rooms inside where you could walk around, there are a lot of animals outside :) they are not tortured so",
          "I gave 3 point due to the fact, that the Zoo Zagreb is trying to do the best they can to make a Zoo interesting. At the time we visited it they were just renovating it. But the lack of main attractions (elephant and the giraffe) made us sad and we left the Zoo with a feeling of",
          "Located in Maksimir park, close to the center of town, this zoo has worked wonders on the small space they have. A truly modern european zoo.",
          "Maksimir forest Zoo is a must for anyone in the city. Been reconstructed this year. Walk around animal habitats surrounded by forest and historic architecture.",
          "Very nice place, has a beautiful and entertaining animals were my friends and I and we fed monkeys recomended",
          "Nice location of new ZOO in Zagreb. The ZOO is party stll under the construction but anyway is very nice arranged and very interesting. Manny visitors come to see the ZOO and enjoy in nice pavilions with wild animals. New attraction aere two very young small lions but also other",
          "This zoo is a must for anyone in the city. While my last visit it was under reconstruction (June 2016) and almost half of it was out of service and yet it was worth it.",
          "They keep renovating this Zoo so it gets better each time I visit it. The new lion area is really nice and the bar in the middle of the zoo next to the sea lion is very cute and mediterannean looking. They serve good ice cream!",
          "It is recommended to visit during sunny, but not too hot days, because there's a lot of moist because of the animals, plants and water surfaces. If you're a ZOO lover, I guarantee you'll love it. It's located near Maksimir park which can be accessed with car/tram or by foot",
          "This zoo is very modern, with loads of different animals. You have the whole pavilion for snakes for example. Very nice for running away from the rush of the big city, and very good for children.",
          "The zoo is undergoing a lot of renovation, and many of the exhibits already offer comfort for the animals while giving spectators a fantastic view (e.g. the chimp exhibit was surrounded by wire mesh & glass).",
          "The Zagreb Zoo has a variety of nice animals to see, the display and collection of the animals are very good. Recommended for animal and nature lovers",
          "This is a very nice ZOO but at the moment it's under construction. I think it's still really nice that they reduce the price. For that kind of money I think it's more than worth seeing the animals.",
          "I visited Zagreb Zoo, again after maybe 15 years. it was disappointing that almost half of the park was closed for renovation, but I think that this reconstruction of complete Zoo in few stages is going in good directions. newest 'reptile' house is very well equipped, very",
          "We walked from old town out to the zoo only to discover it was closed for renovation . It will not be open until mid September. That said, we enjoyed our walk, but did take the team back. The park us lovely for a walk too.",
          "Yes the zoo is having major reworks but the price of entry is 20 kuna! Worth every kuna just to see what is open. The lions, reptile house, cheetah, camals etc are still viewable. I would definitely go again when it is full open as its a lovely set out zoo and the animals are",
          "This is so nice place to visit in Zagreb If you have kids, jou just have to visit this one. The location is great in Maksimir amazing beauty of nature. They have some work there in zoo. I'm so glad that they do something new it will be amazing for kids for sure we wil come",
          "Again, best and cheapest way to get there from the city is on the fantastically cheap tram network at only 30 Kuna (approx. \u00a33 for a day ticket) which can be purchased from most newsagents. The cost for entry is a staggeringly low 20 Kuna (roughly \u00a32) and is for as long as you",
          "A large part of it is closed for renovations. But the open part is excellent. Children enjoyed watching the animals. Recommendation everyone.",
          "It was a nice trip, with a great range of animals to see. Some enclosures seemed small for some of the animals but it is still under construction so may be increasing that aspect. Great for kids I think, especially we there was a puppet person singing and interacting with kids.",
          "Very nicely decorated and interesting, but at the time of my visit number of animals was low, mainly because new habitats were being built at the moment.",
          "We were happy to visit beautiful Zagreb Zoo, but this time wasnt so beautiful. They start with big changes in Zoo. So u can see 30 % of it in this period. That is really sad coz you still need to pay entry 3 euros. Also we dont like new entry (they moved to other side, out of",
          "The Zoo really has a big variety of animals and everything is well constructed. The Zoo is getting a big upgrade soon so if anyone, like me, hates construction works, jusr be patient.",

          "Zagreb ZOO is not the bigiest, not the oldiest , not the one with a lot of animals but it is really nice to see. It is part of a beautiful Maksimir park with lakes and worth of visiting. This ZOO is good maintened alsko the animals, all kind of it. Kids will enjoy this visit",
          "The size and interest surprised us for this Zoo. It was a great day and the recently renovated lion area was great. There are ongoing renovations which will only add to the whole experience. Short tram ride from old city centre, or comfortable walk of around 30-40 minutes.",
          "Strange animals with careful cares , workers now how to care them and all our friends look happy thereee",

          "Went to the ZOO in July, and It was a bit empty, there was everywhere some working and no animals. And don't come in summer time.",
          "It might have some constructions going on in some of the animal enclosure but it is still never boring! It's designed so that we are as closed up to the animals as we can without the risk of being injured, compared to other bigger zoos. For example, I felt chills down my spine",
          "Called in on last full day to see zoo that is located in part of a large town park. Small zoo but great size to while away a few hours in Zagreb, Quite a lot of new areas being developed/uprated but some interesting areas in a good setting. Easy parking across the road from the",
          "The zoo is a part of Maksimirski Park, on its southern side. It was opened in 1925 and covers the area of about 17 acres with more than two thousand animals. It is a small zoo, but well kept and worth the visit.",

          "This is a nice little zoo spread across several islands. A lot of it is undergoing construction right now as they appear to be upgrading the entire zoo at once but it's still a worthwhile visit. There is almost no food available in the zoo however so eat before you arrive.",
          "Firstly, this zoo costs only \u00a33 to enter so we weren't expecting much. However, it's lovely and the animals look really well cared for in lovely surroundings. A couple of the enclosures looked like they could have been a little bigger but the Zoo is currently under going a lot",
          "It is a large zoo, with not a lot of animals in it. It is being re-built and you can see all the new habitats are really nice for the animals. The animals look very well kept and happy to be there. Take into consideration there is a lot of idle walk in this zoo as the habitats",

          "This is a small zoo which is in the process of reconstruction, but my children (aged 8, 5 & 2) had a wonderful time. Being a small and compact zoo my kids did not get tired of walking around and one could get close to the animals and there was also an excellent 'petting-zoo'",

          "I was there for few hours, it's not so big so you can actually see everything. You get a little bit tired of walking, but you have cafe and a small restaurant with fast food, so you can sit down and enjoy. Animals are interesting, you get to experience feeding (you can watch",

          "It is clear just how much work has gone in to every single enclosure, animals are well kept and there is a brilliant variety. Every enclosure was unique, offered brilliant viewing points and we got to see all of the animals out and about because it was so quiet. There are still",
          "Lovely park for relaxation, recreation or just taking a walk. Zoo is considered one of the most beautiful one in this part of Europe. The best thing about this park is that it's constantly developing and modernizing, cages and dwellings are constantly getting bigger and better,",
          "The entrance fee costs about three pounds and we spent a good afternoon there - a very large zoo with plenty of animals. The chimp enclosure was a bit disturbing as they kept screaming and running round and seemed a bit cramped but the other animal enclosures were sizeable and",
          "After spending time in the city of Zagreb with lots of tourists I took the #12 tram to the zoo in Maksimir Park. Get off at Bukovacka stop (soccer stadium is south and park is north - cross at pedestrian traffic light). I visited at 9:30 a.m. and was delighted to see animals",
          "At first we taught it was very low maintained as the water was dirty without circulation and the exibits were poor. But going more into it you can note that there is lot of work that is getting done. I found that this zoo have a great variety of reptiles and amphibians. And",

          "I like the calm atmosphere at entire park, not only the ZOO. It is located practically in the city center but you don't feel any of metropolis rush. The animals at the zoo are well maintained while the thematic sites such as the tropical hall are probably newly done and very",
          "It is located in a very nice area of the city right inside of the maksimir park. The Zoo isn't very big or very impressive but if you are looking for something to do in a nice weather day, I'd recommend it!",
          "I visited this place many times.There are some nice animals lions,zebras,bears,sea lions.You can also see how they feed some animals.This is a great place to visit, but if we compare it with zoo in Vienna or Berlin it cannot get five stars.",
          "The Zoo is very big and has lots of animals, specially the lion pride and the cheetah were amazing.. you get a great view to see the animals.. my son enjoyed and so did we.. the monkey / chimpanzee enclave looked a bit smaller but it was good for the kids.. You have to walk a",
          "I approached this with some trepidation but was pleasantly surprised. While some of the enclosures, especially the bird ones, were too small, most of the other animals looked well cared for and fairly happy. A lot of work has been done clearly, and is still being done. It is",
          "I let my brother talk me into going to the zoo with him and his two boys.I stile remember when u could feed elephants with peanuts.So its been a while from my last visit!But I love Maksimir and to learn new facts about animals so I was game.And it was really good,it was not too",
          "I am still not convinced about zoos in general. I say that as seeing wild animals, especially hunters like lions, leopards, cheatas, and also such graceful see creatures like sea lions etc, all caged makes me positively melancholy. But I will stick to the zoo as no more than a",
          "Zagreb has not got many places of interest so if you want to spend a couple of hours relaxing and watching a limited variety of animals then Zagreb zoo can give you the answer with a few euro entry ticket.",

          "I only went for 3 stars on this which may not be totally fair. If for example i were to start making comparisons to world zoos then its maybe less, if i were to compare it to the zoo in Split, in the same country, then its 5 star. So lets be open minded here and remember where",

          "For the equivalent of around 4 euros, it is hard to see what else there could have been. Easy to spend several hours there, there is a wide range of animals and it is not too crowded with people. Slightly sad to see that some of the animals were in enclosures that were very",

          "Been in ZOO, many, many times. It's ok. But I really don't like the cages. Animals are unhappy in a place like zoo, but when I see those poor bears without nature to walk on... it's heartbreaking. Seals in too small swimming pool, monkeys with sad eyes in their small cages",

          "In many ways Zoos are depressing, particularly for large animals locked up in spaces far too small and this zoo is no exception. Having said that efforts are being made to provide more suitable spaces with work well underway. It's not up to the class of Berlin or Western",

          "This zoo is a great one! We enjoyed so much with our family. First the tickets are VERY cheap. We paid 30HRK (4,2\u20ac) for adult and 10HRK (1,2\u20ac) for kids. A big part of the ZOO is renovated and made in such a way that you can see the animals \u2026",
          "Fantastic zoo experience in a recently renovated Zagreb zoo with many great animal exhibitions.\n\nHowever the restaurant is greatly lacking in selection and quality, so if you are planning to stop by for lunch I would recommend to go \u2026",
          "A very nice quaint zoo not too far from the center of Zagreb. Public transport access is very good. A fair few enclosures are currently being renovated, however.",
          "For a city the size of Zagreb, this is an outstanding zoo. It is nicely landscaped between pleasant walk paths and very well cared for. All the animal information is well written in both Croatian and English. Our only problem was visiting \u2026",
          "One of the best Zoo's in Europe",
          "Awesome place. Very educational. And not expensive at all. Awesome ffor a day trip",
          "Plenty of (rare) animals, amazing for the kids and a very nice way to spend several hours. Next to a big park so you can continue the outdoor experience there.",
          "Exellent!",
          "I 've been to many zoos in Europe (Budapest, London, Ljubjana, Vienna etc)/but this is the best! Great interaction with the animals and many rare species in a very affordable price. Will definitely come again!",
          "A very nice Zoo that cooled us off in the hot summer days in Zagreb. The kids love it and I actually enjoyed as well. It is so big but you don't notice how far you have to walk as it is designed nicely with walking paths under the trees. \u2026",
          "Best Zoo Ever.....    You get really close to the animals",
          "Great zoo experience, check times online so you can attend scheduled feeding and lectures by the keepers. A lot of species, petting zoo with goats, sheeps abd pigs. Children friendly and it takes you around 2,5 hours for a full tour. Some animals definitley need upgrade of their enclosures.",
          "It's big and the animals sre beautiful",
          "Truly a great place for kids in Zagreb :)",
          "awesome zoo, really worth a visit. Price is fair",
          "Great fun for kids.",
          "Beautiful! For kids and adults alike. Plus lots of shade and pleasant breeze :)",
          "Some animals exibits are not in good shape and some of them could be more cleaner, and definitely some exibits are small for animals.\nBit also as you can see there were some great moments too.",
          "Lovely \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc93",
          "Small ish cozy zoo with some cool interesting exhibitions",
          "Perfect place for a day in nature. You'll forget that you're in a big city.\nDon't let the size fool you. This isn't the biggest zoo in the world but you're gonna need at least 2 hours to speed-run through it, and if you want to see \u2026",
          "A lot to see and a nice location. The animals seem to have a lot of space; I'm not an expert but they seemed mostly content. A lot of information was also available for each area and there are some interactive areas for children, as well as a petting zoo.",
          "Great place to spend some time with kids..",
          "Very clean, natural. The animals seem very well kept and living in good condition. The price for entry of reasonable price. Well worth to visit. The only down side is the car park which is either nearby carparks but not dedicated zoo's \u2026",

          "A cool Zoo with plenty animals to see and a great park",
          "The Zoo changed substantially since I was a kid. And all for the better. Apart from the animals and the repertoire, the restaurant is also new (good food selection).",
          "The zoo is wonderful, definitely ranks top 3 attractions in Zagreb, as well as one of the cheapest.",
          "Very nice place, many animals. You can eat inside the zoo, there are few restaurants and souvenir shops.",
          "In my opinion, Zoological gardens are fundamentally wrong, kind of a necessary evil. That being said, for what it is, this zoo deserves some praise. Huge continous improvements in the past 20 years, still ways to go till all animals have a decent- again relatively speaking- habitat.",
          "Horrible place, no being should live like that, caged for life. Animals are living in horrible conditions, all of them depressed and traumatized. 1 star is too good for this place.",
          "Still in middle of renovations some of enclosures small, animals looked bored and some were showing signs of repetitive behaviour. Not the worst ive been to but also not the best\ud83d\ude41",
          "Love this zoo. Lots of animals to see, in a park in the center of Zagreb. Wheelchair accessible.",
          "Good for family visits.",
          "Inside a huge park or more precisely a forest, it's the ideal place to spend a whole day especially if you are with kids.",
          "Wonderful place to spend a couple of hours",
          "Nice place with wide range od species, especially birds",
          "So many animals to see beautiful enclosures very natural made and quite big as well so the animals love it there. Lots of shade and places to rest (as well a restorant), its educational they made it easy and fun to learn about the \u2026",
          "Constantly improving. It is fresh on each visit. Will wisit again.",
          "Nice arrangements. Not so many animals.",
          "Very impressive, many interesting animals, only 30 hrk entrance",
          "Nice to walk through, but a bit small and a lot of animals you can't actually see, and it says they have them",
          "Perfect destination for a half-day family adventure, but also for solo crusing to town. In these hot days, it's a perfect oasis to hide from heat and to enjoy the beauties of wild and domestic animal kingdom.",
          "Small zoo. Couple of great enclosures. Nice visit.",
          "Very big Zoo situated near town center. Little hard to find entrance, but when you enter, you can see animals right away. We walked for 2 hours and still couldn't see everything. It has a lot of animals, some exotic, some just breathtaking, \u2026",
          "Lovely place on advent!",

          "The should get more money, but cool staff, working hard there",
          "Embarrassing. Animals need more space. The sea lions are one of them. Some animals were swimming in their own poop.",
          "Place is nice. Small enough to be right for kids and big enough to see what you should in a zoo. Great for kids, families. Bathroom is nice and tidy.",
          "The animals here are wonderful",
          "Very nice place, existing to visit a lot of animals and nice attractions.",
          "Good place to bring your kids! Tip: there's not much air conditioned rooms there - only shop and restaurant.",
          "Great place to spend few hours with kids",
          "Since last time I have been Zoo was completely renovated. Now you have nice place to eat just by sea lions, also even if you come in winter time you have many indoor places to visit like snake house, bug house, Madagascar house, monkey house etc. Definitely spot to visit in Zagreb specially if you are with kids.",
          "Great fun for kids and adults. All sorts od interesting animals. Very tidy and cool :)",
          "For family and kids. Very nice and good restaurant. Not a big zoo.  But with very animal friendly areas and thematic park's. \nNice place to spend 2-3hours in nature but so close to city centre",
          "Great ... Must see",
          "There were a lot of people when we were visiting the zoo. As the result there were queues to all animals. But maybe it was like that because of the holiday: the first of May.  One more thing I don't really get why it's allowed to smoke in \u2026",
          "A lot of different animals, playground for kids and much refreshment areas",
          "The zoo takes great pride in its conservation efforts. Bit by bit, different enclosures are being renovated and expanded to give the animals the best possible conditions in captivity. Animal enrichment is also a valuable focus.",
          "Great park and nice zoo. Good located. Sometimes hard to find parking.",
          "Very well made",
          "One of the most beautiful Zoos I've ever been \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Takes few hours to see all of animals there, few pavilions with snakes, birds and fishes. Great for kids, Caff\u00e8 bar and souvenir shop are inside the zoo. Tickets are verry cheap, can be on student sale or special price for children. Very nice park Maksimir around the Zoo, worth to spend hole day there.",
          "Good place to spend the day",
          "I was really surprised how nice Zagreb zoo is Especially replite pavilion was awesome.",

          "Nice enclosures and many different animals",
          "The best place to relax and have fun with your family. Entrance is not expensive and it is \"must go\" place for turists \ud83d\ude0a It is also in the park Maksimir so later you can visit the most beautiful park in Zagreb \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfde\ufe0f",
          "A beautiful zoo with many amazing species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.",
          "It gets better every year",
          "well we liked it pretty much. and even if price would be 100% up, still wouldnt mind it. good price and much to see..\n\n but i found out i probably wont ever again visit any zoo. couze u can see some animals are not happy. like the bear in \u2026",
          "Excellent place for day escape",
          "Stillnwork to be done but good atmosphere",
          "Ok so the worst zoo i have ever been to (i have been to 2 zoos in my life, including this one so i would know ) but its still a zoo that seems to care about their animals and whenever I visit, I am overwhelmed with joy (might be the nostalgia talking though, since as a kid i was here a lot)",
          "Great ZOO park",
          "Awesome, you need at least 4hours to see everything \ud83d\ude03",

          "Prices: adults  30 kun, kids  from 7 till 18 20 kun , kids under 7 free of charge \nNice zoo, recommend to visit for family with small kids",
          "Very nice place, if only it didn't have animals in cages.",
          "I generally love the place but summer experiences are always a bit below expectation: you pay the full price but only 1/3 of animals are there. Also, minor detail about the ice cream service: small children shouldn't eat more than 1 scoop. \u2026",
          "Small zoo. Show animals in good way",
          "Great place for kinds to see lots of animals",
          "Great zoo, just cozy and so easy. Kids adore it",
          "Zoo is fine if you like to see many snakes, lizard and various bugs. If you want to see giraffes, big cats except lions,many monkeys like before and bears this is not place for you.Every time when I come to zoo this zoo have got less and less animals",
          "Great environment, excellent animals and very clean!",
          "Improvement can be seen every visit.\nNow it is really place to spend quality family time.",

          "Beautiful habitats! Lot of wild life to see! To bad they are in captivity....but that's life!",
          "Not the biggest, not the best, but surely as exciting. Been there for ten times in 20 years period, so I have seen its ups and downs. It's always renovating something, animal species come and go, exhibits also...\nIf you want to stop and see \u2026",
          "Kids love it here, and that's most important thing.",
          "Really good zoo. It has been 2016 renovated in phase 1 and it will continue to grow. They dont have big animals like elephants but all the animal living places are made to be what animal needs.",
          "Missed elephants. Otherwise a nice experience",
          "Excellent place to spend 2-3hrs with your kids. But avoid restaurant over the weekends, slow, slow, slow...",
          "To start off with good things first: zoo is very well organized and modern. Nice walking areas with almost all flat surfaces makes it easy for wheelchair or baby stroller to move. There are plenty of benches to sit around while watching \u2026",
          "Bit a big zoo, but it is organized good and it is tidy and informative. Main attraction are sea lions, I've been lucky as it was feeding time. Zookeeper was telling stories about sea lions while feeding them. They also performed some tricks.",

          "Every kid needs to visit this zoo. And not just kid, everyone.",
          "Zagreb zoo is steadily transforming from concrete jungle into modern zoo. Places for animals are becoming more friendly, spacious and better for animals but also for visitors. Lion den is just one example if one remembers how it was 5 or even 20 years ago. Maybe a bit more activities for kids won't be bad idea for the future.",

          "New setup looks very nice and interesting\n a bit more interaction for kids wouldn't do harm",

          "Great ZOO with lot of animals and other interesting experiences.",
          "Dissapointed with zoo policy regarding tickets. If I buy a ticket that gives me the right to stay the whole day, why would I not be able to get out and get back in? My kids wanted a break from the zoo and come back later but for this you need to buy new tickets.",
          "Amazing place, would recommend to keep half a day for the visit. Nicely maintained and easily accessible by a tram.. a must visit",
          "Perfect experience for kids!",

          "Nicely arranged. Has some funky interactive stuff and questions. You can watch how the animals are being fed and the feeder explains abot the animals.",
          "Went there because it was included in the ZagrebCard. The Zoo is inside a huge park, where people jog, chill and walk their dogs. There aren't enough bathrooms in my opinion and I think some areas should be cleaner. Many animals weren't seen. If you haven't been to others Zoos I guess it's ok.",

          "They really improved some of the animal habitats, but some are still small and sad to look at. I hope they will also get better. The space is nice, the price of the ticket is okay. The best part was the feeding time,you can learn a lot from the zoo keepers stories.",
          "Renewed last year, big, located next to the park with 5 lakes,but no giraffe and  elephant",
          "Overall good. Some important animals are missing like giraffe, elephant, tiger etc. The walkways are not organised/guided properly, hence there is a chance that someone miss some areas. Zoo maintained good with a natural feel. Worth visiting. 30kuna per person. Zoo spread over a wide area near to the park.",

          "Nice clean Zoo, with animal diversity from spiders to crocodiles and zebras. Inside you will also find a restaurand, relax areas and a gift shop. Prices are around 30 kunas(5euros approximately per person). I recomend parking across the street, at the stadium parking lot-10 kunas/day",

        "wiki": "The Church of St. Mark (Croatian: Crkva sv. Marka, pronounced [tsr\u0329k\u028ba s\u028beto\u0261 mar\u0329ka]) is the parish church of old Zagreb, Croatia, located in St. Mark's Square. It is one of the oldest architectural monuments in Zagreb.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Romanesque window found in its south facade is the best evidence that the church must have been built as early as the 13th century as is also the semicircular ground-plan of St. Mary's chapel (later altered). \nIn the second half of the 14th century, the church was radically reconstructed. It was then turned into a late Gothic church of the three-nave type.\nMassive round columns support heavy ribbed vaults cut in stone and an air of peace and sublimity characterizes the church interior in its simplicity. The most valuable part of St. Mark's Church is its south portal, considered to be the work of sculptors of the Parler family from Prague (end of the 14th century). \nThe Gothic composition of the portal consists of fifteen effigies placed in eleven shallow niches. On top are the statues of Joseph and Mary with the infant Jesus, and below them one can see St. Mark and the Lion; the Twelve Apostles are placed on both sides of the portal (four wooden statues replaced the original ones which had been destroyed). In its artistic composition and the number of statues, this portal is the richest and the most valuable Gothic portal in southern Central Europe. \nOutside, on the northwest wall of the church lies the oldest coat of arms of Zagreb with the year 1499 engraved in it (the original is kept in the Zagreb City Museum). \nOn the roof, tiles are laid so that they represent the coat of arms of Zagreb (white castle on red background) and Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.As the corner of St. Mark's Square and the present day Street of \u0106iril and Metod, was a Town Hall, the seat of the city administration in medieval times. The building has gone through a number of alteration and reconstruction phases, and today this old Town Hall still keeps its doors open for the meetings of the Zagreb City Council.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Zagreb\nZagreb Cathedral\nKaptol\nGradec\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Skulpture s ju\u017enog portala crkve Sv.

          "It was quite a long walk from our hotel (The Palace Hotel) but was definitely worth it!! The road leading to the church has cute souvenir shops along the way making it even more interesting...rare finds!! The church itself is beautiful, serene and picturesque",
          "Such an eclectic mix...the tiled roof is something to behold, just one of the many interesting buildings in the square.",
          "A beautiful church in the center of the town. Cant miss it as it is basically a part of the walk around town",
          "Nice church. The special thing to St. Mark's church si the roof made from coloured pieces that illustrate the ensign of both Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia on the left side, and the emblem of Zagreb city on the right side. In front of the church you can see the guard changing",

          "Unique church with charming roof. I understand the church itself is closed. The whole square has some interesting buildings including the Parliament",

          "It was so famous and all travellers must go. We saw a lot of tourists from worldwide to pay a visit and just for some pictures and then left. Group after group and we waited for all left in order to take some pictures without people at our background!",

          "Very picturesque church in a lovely square surrounded by parliament buildings. From here walk down to the last city gate left from the city walls.",
          "The outside of the Church is unique. Not much around that area. We did not go into the church. It was not the highlight of our trip but if you have the time and are nearby it is worth the stop.",
          "Such a surprise when you see this roof! On a square in the old upper town. Lovely portals, interesting church.",
          "Beautiful church on inside and out. Nice talk in upper town. Beautiful buildings all around. Loved it all!!",

          "I absolutely love visiting churches when I travel and this one stands out as I look back at the many different ones I've visited. The tile art on the roof is beautiful and makes it seem like something out of a fairytale. When we were there in May 2018, we were the only ones",
          "While we were never able to enter the church (it was locked the entirety of our visit), we were able to enjoy its wonderful exterior. The tiled roof is magnificent. Recommended",
          "Lovely church in the old town. Well worth the walk up the hill. There is a funicular train that is very cheap - from memory it was approx 50p (4 kuna) for a one way journey. The church sits on a lovely square. Like most of Zagreb there\u2019s not too many tourists so relaxing to get",
          "Another beautiful old church but this one had a lovely colorful tile roof. On the day we were there they had a group of people walking around in the period costumes. Very pretty. There was also a wedding or maybe several ones at that time",
          "A beautiful church with historical tiles on the ceiling that makes a memorable visit. Definitely worth a visit",

          "This is a must see in Zagreb. You can see most of the church and square in about 15 minutes. The beautiful tile roof is not given any justice in pictures.",
          "A building with a totally different architecture and design. A place with beautiful blend of colours with interesting characters around it.",
          "Great historical church in the old upper part of Zagreb that is close to everything and a great example of local architecture.",
          "The church does not want interior visitors-there is a sign posted outside asking for that respect-but it is definitely something to go view as the pictures one sees are not representative of the beautiful tile work in person. The square is a great landmark to begin exploring.",
          "Really liked the pretty colours and design of the roof tiles! Maybe only worth a walk past though. Advice from the guide was to wait till 10-15 mins before or after service (6pm) to visit the church, as the priests do not like tourists.",
          "This is a lovely square to visit in the old town of Zagreb and a great place to view. Unfortunately only opens for prayers at 6:00pm so not so easy to view during the day when touring but the outside is lovely and a great point to see coats of arms upon the roof.",
          "The church has a unique appearance with the coat of arms of Croatia and Zagreb painted on its roof. Worth a visit",
          "Iconic church on the outside but hard to tour inside. The doors opened for Mass at 6pm but we viewed the inside from the vesibule only.",
          "Such a beautiful church in the historic old town, and not a lot of tour groups out front so I could get a good photos without people in it. The church may be closed when you visit but the exterior is the reason to come.",
          "The muti- coloured, tiled roof is a famous symbol of Zagreb featuring on many postcards etc. The view over the city from St Mark's is stunning and well worth the climb!",
          "Nice church. But compared to other churches is not interesting especially in terms of the architecture.",
          "The St. Mark's Church is one of the most amazing buildings in Zagreb. The roof tiles design is really nice. The details on the entrance door are nice.",
          "This church was one of the main attractions i wanted to visit while in zagreb and since i had good luck, when i went it was completely empty. Such a special church, one i dont think you could see anywhere else",
          "Iconic building in Zagreb despite being closed all the time. Come early to get nice pictures without the crowd.",
          "St Mark's Church is beautiful ans worth a visit . The area around the Church is also beautiful and nice to visit and spend time",
          "It is incredible! the roof just shines on a sunny day, it has a plaza so that you have enough space to get a good picture. Beware of crowds, I recommend going very early so that you can gaze at it and take pictures without people getting into one of them",
          "This was the picture post card image that lived up to expectations - the roof of the church is stunning. Located close to govt buildings meant that there were few cars in the square - which was lovely.",
          "Stunning architecture. Beautiful square. Very traditional. Heart of the old town. Like many other reviewers have said, always seems to be closed and then get told different times on when it will be opened! Tried a few times but without luck. Would be nice to go inside!",
          "A great church you should definitely visit. I didn't have the opportunity to see the interior, but the exterior is more than rewarding. Really worths taking some nice photos.",
          "The outer side of the Church Looks outstanding with coloured tiles. Gothic Church. Go there to see it and the whole old town.",
          "Small square to take pictures and spend some time. Just across the square there are few museums which can be of interest.",
          "It was wonderful to see such a stunning building is such great shape. The colors were so vibrant and the detail in the brickwork are astounding.",
          "We walked around this little church but also around the streets just beside it and found lots of little places to visit.",
          "Beautifully restored building, the colours are amazing. A must stop spot when visiting Zagreb. Worth the trip.",

          "I joined free spirit tour zagreb, our guide told us when she was young she thought the roof of the church was made of lego! So cute idea! I like the story on the Croatian national flag. The black kuna became their currency\u2019s name. 3 lions faces that do not look like lions, chess",

          "It was really overly to walk around the square looking at the architecture and views. Well worth a visit and the vehicular railway was an experience.",

          "This was beautiful! The roof shows off the crest of Zagreb and gorgeous! Small church, but definitely worth stopping by!",
          "A must see landmark in the Upper Town of Zagreb. Impressive, brightly coloured tiled roof with the Croatian Crest and the Coat of Arms of Zagre. The highlight was the changing of the guards. Stay and watch that when you visit the church.",

The tower, which dates to the 13th century, was built to guard the southern gate of the Gradec town wall. The name is derived from Latin campana latrunculorum, meaning \"thieves' bell\", referring to a bell hung in the tower in 1646 to signal the closing of the town gates.\n\n\n== Cannon ==\nThe Gri\u010d cannon (Croatian: Gri\u010dki top) is one of the Zagreb landmarks. In the 19th century, a fourth floor and windows were added to the tower and a cannon was placed on the top. Since 1 January 1877, the cannon is fired from the tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday. The cannon was to give the sign for exact noon for the bell-ringers of the city's churches.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nTower of Lotr\u0161\u010dak\nDo you know the story about the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower?",

          "I thought it was worth the few Kuna\u2019s to go up. Good views of Zagreb and some history about the canon. Try to get there at noon when they shoot the canon but be prepared for a very loud bang, I almost dropped my camera.",

          "This fortified tower stands just above the funicular. It is an ordinary tall structure with a number of windows. Every day at noon a cannon fires a thunderous shot from the tower. That's it. It is easily visible from the city centre. The cannon was to give the sign for exact",

          "Took the funicular to Upper Town. First stop was Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower. They fire the cannon from the tower at noon everyday so prepare yourself for the cannon blast. It's loud. Hang onto your phone, camera, etc., because the noise from the cannon is startling. lol",

          "Loved seeing the cannon shot; a fantastic tradition. Going up the tower itself is worth a look, but be ready for the stairs!",
          "Not only does the tower give you a fantastic view of Zagreb, it also has a cannon shot every day at noon which is a cool thing to see. On the way up, it has old photos of the city which gives you a good excuse to pause and get your breath back.",
          "We almost didn't go into the tower as there is a nice view of lower Zagreb next to it without having to go up any higher. But it offers a lovely view of St. Mark's too. I thought it was worth it. You can find more pics and info at ETBTravelPhotography Blog",
          "If you take the funicular, it is very close to where the funicular ends. You have to walk up several flights of stairs to the top but its not so bad as there are a few landings where you can \"rest\" and read about the history of the tower. Once you get to the top, there are",

          "Every day at noon they shoot off this cannon. Yes, it's pretty loud. Take the funicular up to save yourself on walking up hill. Once at the top, check out the view, walk up to St. Marks square, etc.",
          "The most important thing about this tower is - be around it at noon! There's nothing more typical about Zagreb than hearing the cannon roar followed by bells every day, right at the noon. It's a century old tradition. You can enter and climb the tower and what you get is one of",
          "No one told us about cannon shoot so missed it. But still the best view of the city. Can be tiring for those who have problems with steep stairs",
          "The climb to the top is broken up into floors so those who have problems climbing will have a good chance to stop and rest and enjoy the view along the way.",
          "Our tour guide brought us to the bottom of the tower - it was a surprise. You are in for a bang! At 12 the cannon shoots from the top window and the church bells ring. If was fun. The view of the city from the area in front of the tower is very nice.",
          "For a reasonable price, you can climb the very steep and tiring stairs (and see some photo displays along the way) to find a wonderful panoramic view at the top.",
          "The couple of bucks admission is worth it for the 360 degree view of the city. Some interesting historical posters in the rooms along the way up the stairs. We missed the noon canon fire by about an hour. Rats! I was looking forward to it. Recommended",
          "Interesting climb & great views from the top. Go at noon to hear the cannon & watch the expressions of any bystanders caught unawares.",
          "Probably a requisite attraction during a town tour. Is historic but not that interesting a building where historic buildings are concerned.",
          "We spent a long time on top of this tower which offers very nice views of Zagreb city. Got a good view of St. Marks Church, Zagreb Cathedral and parts of Downtown. We also got a glimpse of Medvednica mountain from here. Do not miss visiting this tower.",
          "It's the perfect spot to enjoy a nice view over the city. Ensure you're there at noon so you can see the cannon shooting.",
          "So, it is indeed a very good spot to take a look at Zagreb's center - and I recommend to do it exactly before noon - the cannon shoots right under you! You can literally smell the gunpowder.",
          "We visited the old city and came across the Lotscak Tower with the canon. It overlooks the city, being on a hill.",
          "We wanted to go up in the Lotrscak Tower. According to everything I could find about it, it is open daily. Except when we went it was closed. I'm not sure why. We actually had this happen a lot in Croatia so maybe it's just a thing there, things closing even though",
          "The guy who is in charge of the cannon is the happiest guy in the world. His job is very safe, secure, short(once a day at noon) and fun with visitors all over the world. It was all of sudden that cannon was shot, so I startled then couldn\u2019t re ord the very moment!! Just",
          "The canon is fired from here at mid day. There are amazing views from the top. The only way up is to climb the stairs.",
          "This was pretty cool to see. Canon is fired from here. Sits on the outskirts of old town so gives you a great view at top. Small rooms from the stair cases, shows different cannons. The stair cases are small so only 1 person at a time. No one else was really there when we went",
          "The best view all over Zagreb and surroundings. There is no elevator but at the top excelent view will be reward.",
          "At mid day when the canon is fired from this tower at mid day, to have a thrilling experience make sure you are on the balcony over the canon. You have an amazing view of Zagreb from the top of the tower. Lots of steep steps to climb which make the view from the top as much",
          "This tower is located right at the top of the funicular. The tourist information center is located at the base of the tower where you purchase your ticket (20 kunas). The stairs up the tower are wooden and spiral up about 4 floors. There is a landing at each floor where you can",
          "It is located at the top of the city, so you get a great view from the there. Definitely worth a trip.",
          "We were the only 4 to visit here at the time so it was easier being as the stairs were quite tight and passing someone else would have been interesting! It was only a few euros to the top and gave great views across the city and some lovely photos.",
          "You could have missed this place without realizing it. Do look up for the cannon sticking out from the top floor pointing out to sea. One can also get a panaromic view of the city from its foot.",
          "Not at noon. You want to be in the North side of the tower when the 12 o'clock gun goes off. There are some interesting displays or views to look over from each floor so unless you are disabled, don't be too afraid or the climb. You can rest on each floor. Incredible views from",
          "This tower houses the midday canon. 12 noon every day the canon tells the folks of Zagreb it\u2019s midday, just after the church bells peel.",
          "The noon day gun was the highlight of our visit to this tower. Our guide told us to prepare ourselves(all of thinking how loud can it be) for the noise. We must say it was impressively loud our ears were ringing. The cannon in times gone by would signify to the locals and",
          "Climbed up to the top and loved the 360 degree view from the top . Loved the cannon going off at noon - fired by the 5th generation of the family who have done this for over 100 years .",
          "Great views, keep going to top. Kind of Smokey on level with cannon which they shoot of at noon each day. Its just to the right of the funicular.",
          "This Tower is one of the symbols of Zagreb, and a beautiful place if you want to enjoy a view of the city",
          "This tower is located at the top of the funicular in Upper Twon. From there you have wonderful views of the Lower Town...both old and new buildings. The cannon is fired every day at noon from one of the windows at the very top. Synchronize your watch when it goes off!",
          "This tower sits at the top of the funicular. At noon, they fire off a cannon to great applause. The fusilier pops his head out to wave to the crowd. It's one of those things that isn't a huge deal but gives a city a bit of it's own character.",
          "The best view of Zagreb - unlike the Zagreb Eye you do not have metal bars obstructing your view. The tower is beautiful and the climb is not too difficult. At noon there is a canon firing. Recommended going up for sunset in the Summer months as the sun sets over St Marks",
          "few steps up walking or up by the cabine chose your way uptown is close enough so go for it its cool to see the city from there",
          "The legend about this tower is more interesting than the tower itself. The cannon at the top of the tower has been fired once at noon for more than 100 years. To fire this cannon is one of the best jobs in Zagreb.",
          "This is a good place to be at. Has a nice view over the city. At noon, a canon from the tower will shoot to alert everyone it is 12 o'clock.",
          "For only 20kn and an easy climb up the tower, you can have the best unobstructed 360 view of Zagreb. It turns out we were lucky the Zagreb Eye was closed for a private party after all!",
          "Looking at the top, you can see a canon protruding out of a window. To this day, we hear the shot at 12 noon. All churches set their time accordinly. Needless to say, we jumped when it went off. Locals laughed.",
          "Climbing on top is an excellent way to have a lovely panoramic view of the city of Zagreb. The weather was nice when we got up there and the history, introducted inside the tower on each floor is really interesting - especially about the cannon. I do recommend you take the time",
          "We have been travelling through Croatia and nearby countries for about a month and have been up many towers. This one had some interesting displays in it and the noon gun was of particular interest. The only thing that let it down is that the view of Zagreb is not all that",
          "Best aerial views of upper and lower old towns in Zagreb. Good view up the alleyway to St. Mark's Church.",
          "Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower was once a fortified tower that is near the upper town station of the funicular railway in Zagreb. We firstly could not find the entrance of the tower. That's in the Information, and I could buy tickets there. Through this Information room, we wound up in a flight",
          "The expectations were very low so I was surprised wen I got to the top. It actually gives you a great view over Zagreb. Worth a visit.",
          "This 30 meter high tower houses the cannon that is fired at noon every day, as well as providing a lovely view in all directions. Given it is in the upper town, the extra height gives a great view across the city",
          "It's located on the hill, the view from here is moderate. It's enough to see it on the way to go to St. Mark's Church actually.",
          "Be there a few minuts before 12am, to look at the views and even if you want, to visit the interior of the belvedere. The most curious part is that 2 seconds before 12 am every day, they fire a canon shot, as they would back in the day! its nice to see",
          "I cant belive there are still some tourists that are suprised by the cannon shooting. I think everybody firstly introduces himself to the sights that he wants to visit. Especially if you are using Tripadvisor and similar apps. It is an interesting little tower with a small",
          "View to up and downhill Grad. Nice old building. Close to funicular and a staircase walk down into the town.",
          "This was a great little tower and gave good views over the city. They didn't warn you about the boom at 12 noon but we were plenty early to avoid this. Nice little tower, easy to climb and good views.",
          "A nice old tower with a nice view on both parts of Zagreb upper and lower . Funicular going up from lower town . 107 stairs going up . Every day at 1200 canon shooting .Admission to tower 2.5 Euros .",
          "Get here early in the morning or late. We came here about 5 mins before the 12 hour boom came. We didn't know about it and were reading carefully the texts in the building. We went upstairs to the gun and we noticed a lot of people protecting their ears. We couldn't see what",
          "Lots of stairs with a beautiful view. They shot a very loud cannon at noon, so plug your ears. A better view is form the Zagreb 360 if you have a Zagreb Card, that is free, this has a small cost.",
          "it is from this tower that the gun fires everyday at 12pm exactly. Don't get panic it is a tradition in this town. It is also possible to see the city from the top but an entrance fee is taken and not necessarily justified.",
          "Lotrscak Tower is 30 meters high with thick walls surrounding it.. it's the best preserved defence system built in the 13th century... the bell was sounded every evening before closing of the city gates to protect... later in the 19th century a Cannon gun was fixed to fire at",
          "This is a tiny old tower which used to form part of the city walls. One must use very narrow stairs to reach the top from which one can enjoy the views of Zagreb. During summer is usually crowded.",
          "Be down at this location at noon to hear the cannon go off. We stood right in front, and it was quite loud! Many steps to get up this.",
          "Lovely view and the climb is not difficult at all, not matter your age. Nice 360 view of the city. You're inside of some history here, for sure!",
          "The view of old, medieval Zagreb from the tower is amazing. Worth all the efforts. The 12 noon blast from the cannon at the top of the tower is to mark the onset of mid day. There's some interesting history behind this practice, deeply linked to how this noon shot fired once by",
          "Low entrance fee, beautiful views of the city. Its very historic, with good interpretive signage and handouts. Its centrally located and beautiful. Ike most of Croatia, its not disabled accessible, and no AC so hot in the summertime.",
          "it is advisable to go here for great city views than the 360 view deck. Though we were not in time for the canon to go off at 12 o'clock it was still very nice.",
          "Interesting little tower, great view, but the stairs are narrow and steep, so try and pick an off peak time",
          "Either this city view or view from Zagreb Eye. Reasonable cost to walk up tower, on way up lovely historical pictures of city are displayed, the midday clock gun is located here and onwards to viewing tower. Great on a clear day. This area of Zagreb has to be explored; St Mark's",
          "Everyday at 12 o'clock there is the traditional cannon shot of this tower. They also have a Facebook page called Gricki Top, you should like it. Everyday at 12 o'clock they punctually post the message \"BOOM!\", it makes my days happier since I have left Zagreb.^^",
          "my son was texting me while the cannon was about to go off and I fell to the ground in fear - what a great job the cannon blower has!",
          "This tower is also one of the oldest buildings in Zagreb. From its top every day exactly at 12 o'clock shoots the top. It is worth buying a ticket and visiting",
          "Lotrscak Tower has a great spot in the old town section of Gradec with it being located near St. Mark's Church and Square as well as Croatia's Parliament, Stone Gate, Anton Gustav Matos sculpture bench plus it is right next to the funicular station. It's entertaining value is",
          "For someone with stair-a-phobia....it was worth it.......Very safe and secure narrow spiral stairs with museum-like photos on each landing so a nice excuse to rest. Spectacular view from the very top and I made it all the way down without having to take a Valium. Only regret",
          "It's an easy climb to the top where you're rewarded with great views of the city. I'm not great with heights so this was perfect for me as the roof slopes away from you so you're not looking straight down. We watched the man set off the cannon at midday which made me jump even",
          "Amanzing view and a cheap ticket! I recommend this to everybody who visit Zagreb. The old town is stunning.",
          "One guy fired the cannon every noon for 56 years, now they have a new guy. It was originally to maintain local time. We didn't climb it.",
          "Since we walked up the stairs from lower town we did not pay to walk up inside of the tower. It was nice to stand alongside of, it is in good repair and easy to find.",
          "It is a custom that everyday at 12:00 they fire a canon from the Lotrscak Tower! What a great bang! The view from the top is breath taking, although I was bit sacred because it was windy and a bit more high than my comfort zone.",
          "well worth the price of admission to see the view and to look at the cannon that is fired daily. The history of the tower is presented well.",
          "Tower at top of funicular ride that lead to views over the city. Tower has cannon that fires at twelve noon each day. Locals are aware of firing but can be a shock/surprise to visitors.",
          "At the top of the funicular railway, this solid, rather unattractive tower has a viewing platform at the top that gives a 360d view over all of Zagreb. It may be the highest point visitors can go anywhere in the city.",
          "This is where you go to see the BEST view of Zagreb, as simple as that. Yeah you need to climb some steps but that's all a part of the experience.",
          "A trek up to the tower is a real treat. The tower is located right at the upper station of the funicular tram, which means you can take the tram right up to it from Jelacic Square for 4kn ($0.60), or you can walk over to it if you find yourself already in Upper Town (barely",
          "We did a walking tour. The view from the top was beautiful. At 12 noon we stood underneath the Tower, to wait for the canon to be fired. Gosh it was loud. Then the man waves from the window.",
          "School kids and tourists gather here at noon to witness the canon fired. Keep your eyes closed to the tower as it only shot once.",
          "A must for everyone visiting Zagreb to get a great view of the city from this tower. You really appreciate the view of St. Mark's Church and the Cathedral all from the same place. Really beautiful. Highly recommend.",
          "This tower is one of the oldest buildings in the old part of Zagreb. It is known for the gun that fires at gunpoint every day at exactly noon",
          "Built in the 13th century, to guard the southern gate of the Gradec town wall. Located 100 meter from St. Marks church, I recommend you come up here from Ban Josip square, it will have to climb many steps, pay the 20 Kunas, kids are free and climb another 160 wood step to get to",
          "This market is a major in Croatian, is beautiful, surrounded by old buildings or the lack of it as dirty and messy",
          "Little mouseum, really great view. The price is around 3e, what is a good price for that offer. Definetly worth of visiting.",
          "It is a lovely tower from where you can have a great view of the town. You have to climb less stairst that you would assume first :) Wort to visit!",
          "Chose to go here instead of to the slightly pricier Zagreb 360 viewing tower. A winding staircase leads you to the top, with appropriate viewing spots on the way. Do not miss the 12pm cannon shot!",
          "Do pop into this tower for a fantastic view of Zagreb. This can be as a replacement for Zagreb eye. Time the visit so that you can hear the canon fire at 12 noon!",
          "This 13th century tower just radiates with history. On the top of the tower there is viewing point from which you can see Zagreb. Try to come to Lotrscak tower at noon so you can see and hear Lotrscak cannon firing. Very nice experience.",
          "This building is well worth the visit and you can find out about its history. The view is stunning and worth the climb. We timed are visit to witness the firing of the cannon. Again, if you have the time, this is a great experience. The man who fires the cannon is very nice",
          "No better place to see all the city of Zagreb than the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower\u202c! Every day at 12.00 at noon you can hear the canon of the city fires , a tradition of over a hundred years! this is one of the best experiences in Zagreb. One can take there great pictures and enjoy his way",
          "Were in the area to several local sites, the funicular, a church or two and more. Were just in time to hear the cannon at moon, but this day they were closed for tourists. Wish we could have gone up for views. I would not come here as a destination, but if you are touring upper",
          "Great view, strong historic value and a cannon which actually shoots every day, can you ask for more :)",
          "Head over to this tower to check out the cannon that is fired from the top window every day at noon. It is shot from one of the windows facing the valley and funicular. You can climb to the top to get even better views of the city.",
          "Good view and quite cheape to enter. Worth to visit, especially for the panoramic view. Be carrefour at 12 for the BIG nosie",
          "Lotrscak Tower is famous for the canon that every day announces noon. If you are somewhere close to tower during the noon and you are not aware that canon is going to fire you could be quite frighten at that moment. In few seconds you will realize that people around don't take",
          "Your in Zagreb - don't miss this tower! In my opinion it is one of the best scenic views you can find, since most towers provide a far distance view but this one is actually really close above the roofs and houses of Zagreb so that you get an amazing view while still feeling",
          "Not only does the tower offer 360' views of the city but it serves as the watch tower to alert everyone when 12:00 noon arrives. Plus, there is a lot of history here! The tower was originally used to alert residents about and to defend them from the Turks. Once that was no",
          "The view form the tower is breathtaking. You can see almost the whole city. The other interesting fact is that in 12.00 PM, everyday they shoot the cannon from the top of the tower.",
          "Located at the top station of the funicular is Lotrscak Tower. It is a winding climb up to the top which gave some views over Zagreb. One way was nice over the forested hills and the old town, and one way was over the more modern city. On the descent we visited a couple of the",
          "get the short but fun funicular ride up to the foot of the tower, and then walk up to the top. its not a bad climb (not claustrophobic) and the views are wonderful.",
          "For 20 kuna you get to have an overview of Zagreb in a historical tower. Great views and inside the tower some historical information as well. I prefer this viewing point to Zagreb Eye.",
          "Not the most beautiful tower but it has a nice view over the city. at noon the are firing a canon (just the sound) from the tower for some historical reason. surprisingly loud bang.",
          "Located at the top of the funicular. Great views across whole city. Interesting history about the defences and cannon. Fingers in ears at 1200 hrs!!",
          "Be prepared to walk a few stairs to get to the top- but it's worth it. We got to the top in time to hear the cannon go off at noon and we got to see the changing of the guards at St Mark's. There is a bit of history of the tower and canon on each of the floors. One can see the",
          "The Tower offers a trip down the town's history with pictures. At the top of the tower, there is a stunning view of the upper and lower part of the town.",
          "It has a nice view from the top of the tower, you can watch the city. At 12:00 oclock at noon you may get afraid of the strong Boom! But it is harmless, you can watch it from close. When you take the funicular from Ilica, you can reach directly to the tower. You can also see St",
          "Lotr\u0161\u010dak tower offers a better view than Zagreb Eye, but that's the only thing it does offer - no beverage, no food offers, the tickets are not too expensive, but for a tourist on budget it's probably not that recommended, as they might already spend a lot of sightseeing",
          "After the Tartars raided Central Europe, towers were built to fortify the towns. Gradec built a wall and a guard tower. At noon, a little cannon shoots from the top-floor window to commemorate a 15th century victory over the Ottomans. You can find this Tower at the top of the",
          "Like most of the towers and this one provides you with a beautiful view. But here you can see the noon - cannon and read about the history of it (for hearing it is not necessary to climb up)",
          "The lady whom we paid to climb the tower was so nice and welcoming to us (as is the case with most Croatians). The climb itself was fascinating, we learned about the canon that fires at noon and about the history of the area. You don't want to miss this view.",
          "Everyday at 12 they fire the canon and there's also a story behind it. It costed 20 kuna to get in but worth it. The view is really nice. On the way up there are a couple of floors with information about the tower.",
          "It was certainly worth the climb to the top of this ancient tower as the views were spectacular over the city and the hills behind and all the more modern suburbs streatching beyond . Pause to read the information on the various levels as you go .They also have a cannon that",
          "For the best views of the beautiful tile roof of St. Mark's, you simply must climb to the top of Lotrscak Tower!",
          "We spotted this place randomly. We didn't go up to the tower but it was a nice view anyways! Just go and take a look of the city!",
          "We visited the tower first thing this morning. It is an inexpensive but worthwhile adventure to pick up a bit of Zagreb history and experience beautiful city vistas. It is an easy climb and pays off with great photos.",
          "We randomly spotted this tower and decided we needed to check it out. The 360 view was worth the few Kunas to go up. You could see the city from all angles and it was so breathtaking.",
          "Good view of the city! Do not miss the firing of the cannon ball on midday. it ONLY fires ONCE!! Boom! that's it!! if you miss it, that's it!! go early, get a good spot! boom and then finish!",
          "In Zagreb, you can hear the blast of cannon fire. It simply means it\u2019s midday. The tower is a must to see. Its possible to visit by funicular. It will cost 20 Kn (adult) and 10 Kn (child) to get to the top. It is also an opportunity to discover temporary exhibitions but the",
          "Small entrance fee (20 kuna) to walk the top (a few flights of narrow steps) to the top for great views of the city--both old and new. The cannon fires at noon daily, so watch your eardrums!",
          "I must admit that I haven\u2019t been up into the tower. I\u2018m so old ( 72 years) that 106 steps to the top is too much for my knees, but I have been at the foot of the tower and also visited the Tourism Information inside.Instead I saw the view from the Zagreb Eye.",
          "This is one of the oldest buildings in Zagreb , with the tower at noon , every day has an old gun . At the foot of the funicular , one of the must-see attraction",
          "This tower has a cannon, which means that around noon you should be far from it. It can be very loud. Other than that this tower is great. You have great views of the city, especially Zagreb Cathedral and St. Mark's Church. The entry fee is cheap and the stairs are not that",
          "I like this tower very very much! Great view, old cannon that indeed fires at noon, old interior and authentic exhibits. And bacause I am a big fan of witch stories (Zagreb is known for that!) most interested to me was a story about this tower as a place for imprisoning and",
          "Cheap and easy walk up to the top of the tower. Great views of the city. Definitely recommend a trip to the tower if you are at this end of town.",
          "I used to live on Ilica just beneath the tower and at 12 every day the gun is fired. Used to wake me up sometimes !! Seriously it's a nice ride up the funicular (or the steps) and you can wander around and get some nice views of the city from here.",
          "the best view of the city of Zagreb As in the best way you want to see and take pictures of Zagreb come to this tower. It provides a wonderful view of the Upper Town and the entire Zagreb",
          "It is not in very good shape, but it is one of the most important landmarks on the hill. It is worth taking a look at it.",
          "People who don't want to climb up to the top (fear of heights ? unfitness ? advanced age ?) might still find a visit rewarding for the pictures which local artists exhibit on the lower floors. The excellent Croatian Museum of Naive Art is only a two or three hundred yards away,",
          "Although I suggest a segway tour, if you choose to walk, this funicular helps a lot. The view for the top is really awesome.",
          "Every noon, a real canon booms out from this wonderful tower. Get a photo if you can of its smoke - from below or even from the city centre. It is right be the funicular, so easy to get to, with great views as well",
          "You have to climb a little bit, but once up there, it's worth of it. You will get nice photo material.",
          "Old town main attraction. Very good view on all over the town. Don't panic if you hear a loud bang at noon - it's this tower signaling a time :)",
          "The tower does not just have great views of the upper, lower, old and new towns, it also has great rooms that feel like you are in a castle and there's a few exhibit rooms (some art during our visit). The tower is also a great place to meet other travelers enjoy the view.",
          "This in not for the faint heart but, when and if you get to the top, the view is breathtaking, best panoramic view ever.",
          "You can look out over all of Zagreb from this birds eye view, but you have to climb quite a few narrow steps on the way. Great for getting your bearings and seeing the most of the city. Watch out for the Emergency exit sign at the top of the climb - if you're anything like me it",
          "This beautiful tower in Gornji grad (Upper Town) stands here from 13th century when it was built to guard the southern part of the town wall of Gradec. The name came from Latin and refers to a tower bell (thieves\u2019 bell) which was signaling the closing of the gates. The tower",
          "Located in the old city it's a fortified tower Worth the climb up for a great 360 degree overview of the city Overlooking the funicular and providing a great view of St Mark's church with it's colourful roof A cannon is fired at noon daily",
          "Probably my personal favorite for Zagreb. You get a good 360 degree view of the city even though you actually don't climb that high. A little sad to have missed the cannon (fires at noon) but we could smell the lingering gun powder wafting through the towed. Definitely worth",
          "This tower really did have some really amazing views and I really do recommend climbing up the tower!",
          "We took the funicular railway and went straight into the tower. It is quite a climb, but at every floor there's a photographic exhibition. The view from the top is quite amazing and surely romantic (perfect if you're a couple), especially at sunset.",
          "The cannon was amazing and the view something more than that! You could stay there and just stare the city lost in your thoughs. Breathtaking view!",
          "The old part of Zagreb famous Tower. At noon every day a canon hit to mark exact time. One of tourist stop point",
          "We chose to climb the tower instead of the Zagreb Eye; the latter was a little higher but we got a great view from the tower. Just to one side is a nice little street with vendors selling craft items which was nice to amble along after the tower climb.",
          "Although it is difficult to climb the narrow stairs when you get to the top you will not regret, offers a beautiful view of the city",
          "Whatever, you do, don't miss the short (very short!! but great) ride up the funicular to the tower. Great views out over the city and the promenade has great vendors. The tower is just steps from the funicular and it's like a gateway to the historic buildings, museums and",
          "Zagreb is known for its clean streets - not a piece of paper to be found. And not only do it's citizens respect and love their city, but they respect themselves by dressing up for even casually walking the streets. Its relaxed atmosphere is perfect for vacation - come, sit,",
          "This tower is one of the two places in central Zagreb that you can go up to have the view of the city (the other one is Zagreb Eye by the main square). This tower is historically important; Zagreb Eye is the top of a modern building. They have slight different views of the city.",
          "And some decent exercise climbing the stairs, of course. Unbeatable panoramas when you also consider the historical value of the tower you're in. The interior has a slightly oddball 'exhibition' of '70s movie and music posters (think ABBA, Xanadu and the like) and jazz mag",
          "Its good however it is the same price as the Zagreb Eye from which you get a much better view therefore I would recommend if you want a good view point to go up the Zagreb eye and leave the tower.",
          "Nothing much except for the daily ritual of firing of a Cannon from the its top at 12:00 PM daily, which is interesting to watch You can climb atop the tower for a nice view of the City below.",
          "This is such a quirky looking tower and we even got to listen to a brilliant busker as we climbed up; there are other viewing platforms but this definitely provides the most authentic experience!",
          "The tower is just opposite the funicular exit if you have come up that way (I'd recommend you did!). You pay to go up the tower. It's quite an easy climb. There's a few floors that break up the climb which makes it more comfortable. On some of the floors there was an exhibition",
          "Good view point especially around noon everyday when the little cannon goes off. Easy to find as it is at the top of the very short funicular ride.",
          "It is very easy to go this tower. The view is lovely. There is a historical little tram but you can walk from old town, it is not steep or long. Enjoy the view up there",
          "There seemed to be far more steps then there really should have been for the height of the tower, but it was totally worth it. The views were lovely, even on a cloudy day. If you visit around midday be ready for the cannon, it's a shock if you're not! Cheap at 20kuna.",
          "We stumbled upon this by accident and as a school group was leaving, only 20kuna to climb to the top. It's 6 floors of spiral steps followed by a narrow set, open deck viewing area giving 360 views over Zagreb, we had the place to ourselves for a while which was nice. Worth the",
          "amazing view from this spot...well worth the steps to get you up there! also very interesting the canon story which is still being fired everyday at lunch time...you will have to get up there to know the whole story :-)",
          "Probably the best place to get a view over the whole of Zagreb. It's not the prettiest of cities but still worth the trip up the stairs to see the cannon and then on up to the view point.",
          "This funicular which dates XIII century allows you to climb effortless to the upper town where you can climb the tower and get the best views of Zagreb",
          "cannon fires everyday at noon with some confetti. only interesting as a novelty. also good to know that you have to cover your ears everyday at noon coz it's pretty loud!!",
          "The tower shoots a cannon every day at midday which is in itself worth watching, but the view from the top of this tower is what makes a visit worth it. It is not a hard climb up but the steps are very narrow. The views you get at the top are amazing though. You can see the",
          "One of the places in town worth a trip to visit. in upper town. Top of the funicular. Not so many locals.",
          "A lovely old tower at the top of the funicular, in the upper town which at its base has some good views, but once you have climbed the steps (quite narrow) to the top the views are even better. You can see for miles either across the city or upto the mountains but it is worth",
          "Funny smell when you come inside, not in positive way. But very interesting little tower, with old wooden stairs, incredible view on the top. You can check the whole city of Zagreb and it's very good for the orientation. They also have old photos of the city inside the tower.",
          "No big signage so you have to be observant to find this tower. Just across the upper exit of the old cable car. Climbing the tower was a bit scary since I was the only patron at the time. Once reached the top you'll be greeted by a 360 degree view of Zagreb. Beautiful !!!",
          "This toward is right at the top of the funicular. Even though you're only a few meters above the funicular, the view is much better. You're above the building around you. The stairs are narrow but surprisingly easy to climb or descend. The interior walls are mostly blank.",
          "This is the only preserved medieval tower from 13th century fortifications. From the tower every day at 12:00 p.m. a cannon is fired to mark midday. That's quite impressive!! Do not miss it!! :)",
          "Located in upper town, there is a very short funicular to get up here or you can travel the long way on the cobblestone streets through other various museums, churches, and sights. The views are quite nice in the tower as well as in front. The cannon shoots right at noon and",
          "Once you've paid you are left to find your own way , and switch the lights on when it gets dark! Interesting contemporay paintings on the way up and graffiti at the top, which unfortunately was not up to Banksy standard. Great Views over Zegreb",
          "It's a bit of a climb, but once on top, WOW. You can see all the upper and lower towns, the mountains and the new part of Zagreb",
          "From the top of the tower you can have a wonderful view of the whole city . It is nice to take many pics.",
          "Lovely view of Zagreb from this tower next to the funicular railway and museum of Broken Relationships . Quite a few steep, tight steps to get to the top but worth it once you get there as you get a 360 degree view of the city. Entry was only \u00a32 each as well which is a bonus",
          "The Lotrscak Tower, overlooking the Lower Town of Zagreb, stands as a sentinel in the Upper Town. At noon every day a cannon is fired from the tower, allowing residents to adjust their watches. The lower part of the tower is an tourist information office.",
          "You can't beat the views of the city! Cost was about $1.70 US. The steps are steep, but no problem for most. Not sure what it would have been like with a crowd of people, with the steps and small upper viewing area. Maybe a dozen people there when we were. A bonus we got to",
          "For a general admission price of 10kn, 5kn for concessions, you can climb the tower and get some really good views of the city. A canon fires at 12 noon so if you don't like loud noises then watch from a distance (I recommend from the Zagreb Eye - 20kn ticket valid all day).",
          "An easy climb to the top. Got there later in the afternoon, so I missed the 12pm cannon fire. But the views from the top are amazing.",
          "Great view, but a little pricey and difficult to get up the tower. Definitely the best view in Zagreb, so it was worth it.",
          "Reasonably cheap entrance fee so you can climb the tower and look out over the city. It was a little rainy when we went so we got it all to ourselves! The view is beautiful and you can see a long way. It is at the top of the funicular so you could take that to get to it, but we",
          "Great views and the cannon is fired at noon so make sure your there when it's fired! Easy climb even if you don't like heights.",
          "This is located just near the station of Funicolare on the hill, the beginning of old town. The view from the top of the tower was actually beautiful with many brown or orange colored roofs, Sv. Marka crkva and Cathedral of the Assumption, the symbol of the town. Here is must",
          "We stopped by on a late summer evening, and were lucky to have the chance to see the city scape just before the sun set. The views are stunning and worth the climb. The stairs are a bit narrow, and unlit in one part. We used an iPhone as light, which was sufficient to get",
          "I love this tower so much! Something draws me to it every time I am in Zagreb. When walking down Ilica, I love to see it peeking over the tops of trees. Worth climbing to the top for the view!",
          "Can't remember how many steps you have to climb if you go up there, but is quite an easy climb and it pays off, a good spot to take a couple of nice photos. You also have a story behind the tower, so ask for it, it's nice.",
          "If you hear a bang a 12 o'clock and see the pigeons in a panic, you have just heard the midday gun. Any tour guide in Zagreb will make sure you are at the tower at midday to hear the gun which has gone off every day since 1876. It is loud, but it will not deafen you. There are",
          "Famous tower overlooking the old town, each day at noon a cannon strikes to mark mid day. Try not to be too close at noon though.",
          "The Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower stands on a steep hill on the southern edge of the Upper Town. You can reach it from the Lower Town by taking steps or a short funicular \u2013 both from Tomi\u0107eva Street which meets the famous Ilica Street. If you are already in the Upper Town just go southwards",
          "It is not too high and not difficult to climb - a bit over 100 steps - and besides the great view of the city, you can also see a photo exhibition on the first floors and the canon that strikes daily at midday. I enjoyed going up and would do it again. It is a great place fir",
          "if you do 3 things in Zagreb...make sure that this is the FIRST ONE you do. A-MA-ZING views it is a bit of a clim but you will be rewarded",
          "Located at the top of the hill from lower to upper town. Walk the steep stairs up and take the funicular back down once you have seen Uptown. Cannon fired at midday everyday so I recommend visiting at that time if possible. The viewing tower is closed over winter but the gift",
          "In case you are into taking a silent walk around the upper town of Zagreb around midday, don\u2019t be surprised if the silence will suddenly be interrupted at noon. Don\u2019t be scared either, the city is not under siege, it is just the \u201cGri\u010d cannon\u201d marking its usual noon activity.",
          "Even if you don't climb the tower the view of the lower city in front of the tower is great with the funicular (currently being repaired) in front of you. Don't forget the cannon shot every day at Noon from the top window. It can be heard throughout the central city.",
          "Tower has been reconstructed and now is again splendid attraction.",
          "Located in the upper town, this place is well worth a visit. Go for the cannon being fired at lunch time, the gentleman at the counter was very helpful and informative. Only 10 kuna to climb up for some great views back to St Marks Church and over Zagreb.",
          "Worth the 10kn to go up the tower for the views of the city, especially on a clear day.",
          "On a clear day it's well worth the few Kuna it costs to climb to the top of the tower and catch the views of the city. You can see pretty far and get a good look at the beautiful roof of St. Mark's church. Of course you should try to be there around noon for the canon shot."

          "Great for kids (old cars , airplanes, submarine, tesla coil..)",
          "Would be nice to keep open the souvenir store, some minutes after the museum close time (I was not able to purchase anything because ended the visit at close time). Also some information inside the museum, should be in english too. In any case, it was a very pleasant experience inside the museum.",
          "This place always inspires! To see old times designs, machinery, electrical staff is a special feeling. Attractions like the real mine under the town and Tesla's lab will be entertainer and eye opener to many",
          "Everyone should see Tesla's cabinet, walk through coal mine and listen about stars. All in one place.",
          "Minor part is on Tesla, still did have some interesting technology displays, not consistently in English.  Old firefighting equipment was interesting, as was the small transportation section, which included a small submarine.",
          "Excellent museum! Beautiful exponents, really fun, you learn a lot! Hope to come again.",
          "A lot of fun and great for kids. The mine tour was introduced in English, but the experiments were only explained in Croatian. That wasn't a big problem and they were still exciting to follow along with and watch.",
          "Beautiful and interesting museum to visit, especially with kids! They have \"old mine\" guided tour, Nikola Tesla cabinet with interesting experiments show, and a cabinet where you can see the projections and learn about the night sky and stars and planets (planetarium)! \ud83d\ude0d",

          "A big museum with display of technical advancements. We went on our own for about 2 hours and had abour an hour and a half tours through a mine underneath the museum, Tesla's laboratory and a Planetarium. All in all, I recommed this site.",

          "Very interesting, although I thought there would be a little more Tesla stuff in the Tesla Technical museum. A lot of the exhibits have only Croatian plaques, and the Tesla demonstration was in Croatian. If this is a concern, the displays are still interesting, but consider yourself warned.",

          "It was a good place and very fun. The illusions were pretty cool and there were good photo opportunities. It was a bit touristic and there were many people there, which is expected but it was quite cramped and had to wait a long time for \u2026",
          "Funny, better if you go with friends or family,  most funny, surprised.",
          "Really amazing place. Full of surprises and fun. Should be on \u201cthe must see\u201d list for everybody visiting Zagreb.",
          "Though basically for kids, it's good fun for adults also, lots of mind boggling games.",
          "The illusions are so incredible that I'm not sure if I'm still in the museum or not. I entered it in August 2017...",
          "This is pet friendly!!! We had a great time here having fun with the interactive exhibitions and our pup had fun too!",
          "It was interesting but could be bigger. \nNo wheelchair access.",
          "Museum is great...recomend to visit.",
          "Fun place for both adults and children. Seems like a popular museum.",
          "Hmmm. It is actually more for kids and families, it has got a few good tricks tho, but , no. It is very tiny and the price is too high actually, it should be more interactive and less stationary.",
          "Very nice, one hour of magic and fun! Some of pictures were too famous...",
          "Very Nice place so spend some Time",
          "It is a museum about optical illusions, not about illusionists or magicians (my significant other was disappointed to realize this)! It was interactive and fun. Kids would really enjoy it!",
          "Not a bad place to spend an hour. Nothing new but I do like illusions. My 14 year old lad was less keen.",
          "It was very warm in the museum. The puzzles they had out you could try before buying were fun.",
          "Well worth a visit. A variety of weird and wonderful optical illusions - make sure you take your camera.",
          "Best museum in Zagreb for fun and entertainment not just for kids",
          "The museum was a lot of fun the entry price is okey but what really bothers me is that this museum is so tiny there is not really much to see if it would be bigger it would get 5 stars form me",
          "Good place to go with friends or family! Lots of interesting things to see! Staff was super friendly and helpful!",
          "Good for you and your kid",
          "There is not much to do in Zagreb anyways. It's  a very small place.",
          "Small entertaining museum. Try to go when it's not crowded. It is hard to enjoy the larger illusions when there are a lot of people inside. Not good for young kids. Better for children probably 6/7 and older since some concentration is required to enjoy many of the illusions and puzzles.",
          "Nice place to visit, bit crowded too much",
          "It is nice place, go in a group to have fun!",
          "Museum is very small, maybe it has max 200m2. Almost all installations are old and used up so they look sad. It's always crowded because it's in centre and there's no \"1in-1out\" policy so you cannot, in such a small place, have any \u2026",
          "This very unique place provides fun for everyone, for the people that just want to spend some time in a quirky place to people that love solving puzzles. Get your camera ready to take some interesting photos and have lots of fun. Even if you don't have time for a long visits, you'll still enjoy it. It's a cool really cool place.",
          "This is a fun place to go visit with a friend.",
          "We had a great time playing around in this museum! It\u2019s crazy how some things work \ud83e\udd17",
          "Very interesting setup. Make sure you read instructions for each piece before attempting to figure it out yourself. It is relatively small setup but will keep you busy for at least three hours. Definitely worth of visiting. Also interesting for kids.",
          "Fun and interactive- doesn't take long to get around, wish there was more. But great as something different to do.",
          "Perfect fun for a group, also educational and brain teesing",
          "Small but special... and therefore not expensive to do something for one hour .. nice on the hot part of the day.",
          "Good for young kids and families. Very interesting, but small.",
          "It's not very big and doesn't have many illusions, but a few of them are fun and interesting mostly for kids. And also it has a shop in it where you can buy brain teasers. But overall it's ok at best but its great for kids.",
          "Great little find.\nTook kids here after flight delay. Cost just over \u00a312 for the family. Great little illusions and experiments. Good for about 1hour.",
          "Great place to have fun with the whole family. You just have to be ready to wait a bit longer to get the ticket and enter because they are letting in a group by group.",
          "Great showcase to bring kids",
          "Great for fun with kids.",
          "Very funny to come and enjoy those weird little brain teasers, but in my experience you can see and do everything in half an hour.",
          "Quirky little museum, but well worth the 30 minutes or so to stop by and check out. There are puzzles and optical illusions (pictures, rooms, etc.) to enjoy. Very cool for children - probably 6+ years old; younger wouldn't appreciate it.",
          "Absolutely wonderful, it's a must see when visiting Zagreb!",
          "Nice but small place\ud83d\ude09",
          "Cheap tickets and it is a place where you can find a lot of fun",
          "Very small, not much of a museum to be honest.\nMost of the \"tricks\" you see there you can find on Facebook",
          "Amazing illusions and its really fun when you are with friends\u2764",
          "Could use some renovation, alot of the illusions were grubby or tatty from age and overuse. Neither toilet had a working lock. Had to strain to read some details as they were high or very low down. A good selection of experiences but expected a bit more to be honest",
          "Very interesting and fun! great for children and adults.",
          "I just love this place. I had so much fun and we made great pictures! \ud83d\ude43",
          "Small place, good experience",
          "Nice for a short fun break.",
          "It was very short and not worth 50 kunas and we waited for over half an hour.",
          "Pretty small but very nice personal and a few cool illusions. \nThe price is also very fair.",
          "Good place to hide from rain \u263a",
          "Great place to visit, specialy for kids.",
          "If you like knowing how your brain interprets reality, this place is for you. Optical illusions, puzzles, brain teasers, holographic portraits and lots of photo opportunities to have fun with. A two floor local museum that has found a very \u2026",
          "Just a few rooms, but you'll find here many interesting and curious stuff. Very nice!",
          "Museum of illusions was really cool. You got to experience and pay first hand in random illusions. I enjoyed playing inside. The place itself is also small enough to get through it fairly quickly. Great with kids.",
          "Fun place to go with kids. Doesnt take long to visit the place",
          "Definitely a must visit....",
          "If you should love wonders and illusions, you myst visit this place. I did and was very happy to be here.\nI eish you were here.",
          "My partner and I had a great time in this museum. As we travelled back 10 years, we sat quite an hour on a table where you try to built a dice in a special way and other stuff.\n\nIt has a part of illusional pictures and some installations \u2026",
          "nice, small, just another tourist trap.",
          "Great experience, fun had by all",
          "Great unusual museum for great fun\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Really cool place \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I definitely reccomend this place because the illusions are awesome! There are also puzzles and mind games.",
          "Fun little museum",
          "Great experience, very nice to see, bit not too many exhibits. Price: 50 kn for adults. Time to see everything: 1h or less",
          "If you need an entertaining break from your walk in Zagreb that's the case especially if you are traveling with your children or a young student. The museum is small and you can walk around it very quickly which I found completely helpful \u2026",
          "Am flying \u2708",
          "It was a good fun to visit museum. The tour is a little short but anyway you can see a lot of great stuff.",
          "Quite small but it's certainly fun for an hour or so. Nice for kids and pretty interactive. \n\nPrice-wise it's pretty doable, just don't plan a whole day for it.",
          "Some great illusions but not that many exhibits and you want to go when it's quiet",
          "Nice place and a must visit. Close to city center and easily accessible by tram. Couple of hours is sufficient and you alao have some puzzles on sale in case you wanna buy.",
          "Very interesting and different forms of illusions, games and riddles \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Nice to visit if you have some time left ... not very special. It's rather expensive for what you get",
          "Very interesting, funny.",
          "A bit too few things to see/try considering the price. Apart from that, an interesting place, and great for kids.",
          "Sweet but short",
          "You do not feel illusion. Waste of money",
          "A fun place and nice detour from cultural and historical site especially for kids.",
          "Great experience, my daughter loved it!",
          "Fun place to get your eyes tricked :)",
          "A bit small for the pricetag, simple illusions.",
          "Fun interactive museum, we didn't visit it long but the price is also low so perfect for a few ours out of the rain.",
          "More like a room of illusions then a museum. Small, uninformative, limited exhibits. Half of exhibits are brain teasers and puzzles which, as we all know, are not illusions.",
          "Great place to visit!!!",
          "Small place but it's pretty fun and interesting. You can see it all between 30m - 1h for 40kn. Worth checking if you enjoy more interactive museum experiences",
          "Very small and not that impressive to an adult but incredibly interesting to kids.",
          "This place was so cool and trippy",
          "Good fun for young and old.",
          "Was good fun with a small group of people!",
          "Exciting, great venue to kill boredom. But definitely not a priority, lesve it for last, unless you just want to have fun and relax your brain.",
          "The best place fir kids ever",
          "Quite fun! But also short tour, even though we tried all the tricks.",
          "Fun place, we enjoyed our time over there. Some of the illusions are mind blowing",
          "Lovely place and some good illusions. Half a day recommended and very close by to the city center.they have some puzzles too on sale which one can pick up.",
          "The place is amazing is not that big but is cool you have so much puzzles to crack you have infinity room and many more you should come and check it by your self.",
          "Good fun. Spent a long time here even though it's not that large.",
          "Very interesting to go and see something different than a classical museum. It's about optical illusions.",
          "Fun and very kind stuff. Tickets a bit pricey (especially for students - 40 kn).",
          "Lots of fun and interactive displays.",
          "This museum is out of this world.\nThe amount of illusions is incredible and it's very entertaining reading and trying them.\nIt's wonderful that this museum is something you can fully enjoy by partecipating in the actual illusion yourself.\nI loved this and I would totally recommend to give this place a try.",
          "Definitely reccomend checking it out",
          "Cute, fun stuff to do with your friend. Doesn't take too much time.",
          "Oh this place is so much fun! You can spend about 30-45 minutes here and feel like Alice in Wonderland. However a lot of the illusions are available on the internet too but the physical experience is much more fun.",
          "This is mostly a place for kids. There weren't that many exhibits",
          "Pretty claustrophobic and small for normal humans. Uuf",
          "I feel like a kid again!",
          "Its fun, but you'd expect more for ths price.\nWhen we went it was also a bit crowded, so that isnt really fun either.\nThe gift shop is pretty nice, where you can play with some puzzles and you can buy them afterwards.\nThe staff is helpfull \u2026",
          "Certainly one of the best tourist attractions in Zagreb, definitely should be in your To do list. For the 40 kuna, you get access to an hour or so of pure fun and joy. A lot of the exhibits are super interesting. Best part - the museum is interactive so you can try everything yourself :) perfect place for funny photos and memories :)",
          "Great museum with lot of optical illusions. Better when is not busy, so check before You go",
          "Fun and cool",
          "Nothing special. They ask us to write them a good comment to give us a discount.",
          "A cool place to visit with children",
          "I expected nothing from this museum so it was a very good surprise at the end. First good thing, the adult ticket is only 4\u20ac. Second the girl from the reception was very nice and helped us to take pictures. You can stay in the museum for a \u2026",
          "It's a small museum where you can observe optical illusions and other images that your brain has a hard time processing. There are also some puzzles which are really tough to complete. It's good that they have those because it gives you a more interactive experience. The infinite room is a nice experience as well.",
          "Such a cool museum, great place to have some fun with your friends! You walk through rooms viewing different puzzles and visual tricks out of which some are really interesting, particularly liked the second floor. Maybe I expected even more exhibits and more rooms, and it was a bit crowded when we visited, but still an awesome place!",
          "I expected more from museum.",
          "Must see in Zagreb, will take you about 1,5h to see everything. Perfect for sundays or rainy days.",
          "We were a group of four and I have to say we weren't that impressed. There are a few cool illusions, but also some \"classic\" ones that you've most probably already seen. There's also a room with puzzles to play with. All in all, we wouldn't quite call this a museum, rather a playground.",
          "While some of the illusions are well made, most are just printed out versions of your typical visual illusions. (e.g. A line that looks longer then another one)",
          "Nice and funny",
          "Very cool!",
          "Fun guaranteed",
          "Worth the visit.. entry fee is around 7 euros",
          "Really nicely set up museum.",
          "The place itself is nice but it's small: a few visitors can make it a worthless experience if you can't test the illusions.",
          "Interesting museum, sadly it doesn't have many attractions",
          "Very cool, but it is very small",
          "When opened was interesting, but after few years I was disappointed. \nIt needs more space and some old stuff must be renovated. Price of the ticket is to high.",
          "It was cool for my kids, we've all enjoyed, but there were less stuff than I expected. It's OK, very nice way to spend your 45-60 min.",
          "Good but if you visit it alone, you can not make pictures",
          "A lot of weird illusions.",
          "It's a very good museum, well done for children too. I suggest to go there to spend two hours in a different way.",
          "Had a couple cool things, but was very small.",
          "Fun for the whole family!",
          "Good for children",
          "It is hot and cramped but amusing nonetheless",
          "Museum with many different illusions and games. I liked it a lot but wouldnt mind that is cleaner. It looks like left from the time when it was open. Toilet dirty",
          "OK place for family\n50 Kuna per person is too much",
          "Nice, funny and interesting.",
          "Interesting and fun. The only flaw is most of their souvenirs are made of wood which makes it difficult to take on a plane cause of regulations",
          "It could be more exponents. But it is OK place to visit. Fun, but short.",
          "Entrance is not expensive, but overall, I saw only few illusions i haven't seen before. I believe it's great for kids, elementary and high school. Nice for taking photos.",
          "Always fun to visit. Really wish for more illusions.",
          "was fun but not very big.",
          "Nice staff, easy to find, there was no need for us to make a reservation before the arrival (although I would recommend to do so in case you know you're coming), they offer water for free and you can buy some t-shirts, brain teasers and \u2026",
          "Very small museum, but fun to check.",
          "Great place for some family time!",
          "Lots of fun! \ud83d\ude00",
          "Expensive tickets for it's size but very interesting and entertaining",
          "This was a really nice way to spend 90 minutes in Zagreb. Cool stuff to see for kids and adults, and a great place to take pictures",
          "Lots of illusions in a small space.",
          "Pretty cool place to waste away an hour or so. But better with friends.",
          "Super place to see nice illusions.",
          "Really cool museum. Not an expensive ticket for what you see. Real fun being out there.",
          "Very cool and  interactive, unlike any other museums in the area. Lots of fun!",
          "Nice location with a lot of ilusions",
          "Interesting exhibition but place is too small and smelly.",
          "This is a great place, looks bigger inside than outside, it's filled with all sort of optical, and other illusions. Great fun, especially for kids. They'll love it.",
          "FDefinately earns the spot as number 1 museum.The que can take a while however its worth the wait. An interesting collection of mind boggling features, with illusion rooms and an array of interactive puzzles to get stuck into.",
          "Small but fun. A bit overpriced for what you get.",
          "really fun and quirky museum, not expansive so can be in and out in about 1.5 hours",
          "Was hoping to see more exponats for that price, and it was pretty crowdy, but overall very interesting ang worth seeing.",
          "You have to be 3 to enjoy it the best way",
          "Impressive and funny.",
          "No much to say, expected more...",
          "Very funny and interesting. Must see!",
          "A bit expensive ticket, but nice place for kids.",
          "Fun but too small",
          "Very less..For 50 kn.",
          "It's ok - a bit pricy (50kn) if you compare it with the big technical museum, and most of the ilusions are very \"old\" and not so inovative.",
          "Cool, but rather small. Was expecting more, looks nicer on photos.",
          "Very interesting place. One hour of fun with kids. Small and little bit overpriced wooden puzzles",
          "Fun way to spend an hour",
          "Pitty they don't heba more space.\nNicely packed with exhibits.\nPlenty photo opportunities",

          "Very interesting place, some really great puzzles around to play,solve and purchase.",
          "Fantastic!",
          "Pretty small, but fun. Full of games to play and optical illusions that can confuse one's brain. It's more fun to go with friends and a camera. Especially recommend for kinds. There's also a small shop where you can buy some logical games - a great souvenir or birthday present ;)",
          "Original concept and great stories. Romantic and melancholic, dealing with several kinds of love and feelings. Each story can be yours and each love story was unique and worthy of being told.",
          "So much fun",
          "Had fun.",
          "Okayish museum. Very small, and a lot of the stuff they exhibit you can also see on the internet. Would definitely not recommend going there on your own, it might be more fun with a second person, because a lot of the stuff takes 2 people to really enjoy it.\nVery friendly and competent staff tho!",
          "Ok, interesting",
          "It was kind of childish, nice for families thought",
          "It is a nice museum for kids, freaking hot in the summer",
          "Nice to spend a little time and try out all the different illusions, can imagine that kids would really enjoy this museum",
          "It is very popular probably because it is the only one around here and catches the entertainment comprehension of new generations. I am not that much satisfied. It is very small and limited compared to one equivalent museum i visited in \u2026",
          "Great staff! They will gladly explain everything and take photos of you! It's a fun place to visit even if you live in Zagreb!",
          "It was not as great as I expected but it was fun and interesting",

          "Don't waste your time and money. Pretty small museum, not maintained and not conditioned inside.",
          "OK way to spend an hour or so. There are some cool curiosities and optical illusions, but it isn't really a museum.",
          "I really enjoyed the brief visit to the Museum of Illusion. I am fascinated by the subject and enjoyed what was on display. You are given a number of illusions to both look at and take part in. I won't ruin the fun and let you have a wander for yourself. ",
          "Very interesting",
          "place is small but the admission fee is low also. Loved the infinity room. great place to spend 1-2 hours of time",

          "Fun place. Good to family with children.",
          "A must visit for kids.",
          "Angled rooms are cool, but hologram photos and other stuff somehow lack in that cool factor. But all in all it's worth 40kn entry ticket and I would recommend everybody to try it. Kids love the big-small room :) ",
          "Interesting concept. However too small to justify the ticket price. Worth a visit though.",
          "Fun, but small",
          "Museum is nice to visit. A bit to small in comparison to one in Ljubljana. I",
          "Very interesting and fun museum in Zagreb!",
          "Two floors of explained illusions on 4 languages. Most of the exibits are interactive, so you will be entertained. Souvenir shop offers interesting wooden puzzles.",
          "Something magical...when you think that you cannot be tricked",
          "Too expensive for what you get",
          "Great optical illusions, and some very tricky logic puzzles! Good to spend a couple of hours",

        "wiki": "Zagreb (; Croatian pronunciation: [z\u01ce\u02d0\u0261reb] (listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level. \nThe estimated population of the city in 2018 was 820,678. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,086,528, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's \u0160\u010ditarjevo. The name \"Zagreb\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf.\nZagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of them are at a low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.\nThe name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum. \nThe older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson.\nAn even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century).\nFor this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D\u00e9csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr\u0119b\u044a which means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatian br\u0207g < Proto-Slavic *berg\u044a, which also means '(smaller) hill', and za br\u0207g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag \u2013 modified from assumed *Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony? \u2013, mentioned above.) An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr\u0119b\u044a is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\"\nbut according to D\u00e9csy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram.\n\nIn Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as  Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri\u010d (Gradec)).\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb  za-grab-, meaning  \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation \nties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka\u017eoti\u0107 (c. 1260\u20131323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.\nIn another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water from Mandu\u0161evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\"Scoop, Manda!\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now \u0160\u0107itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in his honour. During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Zagreb ===\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara\u017edin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara\u017edin and Karlovac general command.\n\n\n=== 19th to mid-20th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first mayor \u2013 Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.\nThe first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\n\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri\u010d cannon is fired daily from the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east and \u010crnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta\u0161a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n=== Modern Zagreb ===\n\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb). \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb-zapad (West\nNovi Zagreb) and Novi Zagreb-istok (East Novi Zagreb)\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.During the 1991\u20131995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many.\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n=== Area and population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), but with significant continental influences and very closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris and London. Autumn in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those districts along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F).The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 \u00b0C (104.7 \u00b0F) in July 1950, and lowest was \u221227.3 \u00b0C (\u221217.1 \u00b0F) in February 1956. A temperature of \u221230.5 \u00b0C (\u221222.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\t\t\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep\u010danka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb \u2013 istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani\u0161te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4\u20138 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani\u0161te or Kajzerica.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n\nThe wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of \u0160\u0107itarjevo.\nPicturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, \u0160estine, Gra\u010dani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, \u0160estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products.\nTo the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament.\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\nThe old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of \u017dumberak-Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,325 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.1 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County. Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia.\nIn 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative centre of both.\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.\n\n\n==== City districts ====\n\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska \u010detvrt, pl. gradske \u010detvrti):\n\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.\n\n\n==== Settlements ====\n\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area \u2013 there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu\u010dko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately. There are 70 settlements in the City of Zagreb administrative area:\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandi\u0107 (BM 365 \u2013Labour and Solidarity Party). He was confirmed as mayor on 4 June 2017 (Zagreb local elections 2017, second round).

The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the Zagreb Assembly city deputies have the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. \u2153 of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).\nIn the City of Zagreb the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a \"city with county rights\", there isn't State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).\nCity administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration.\nThe city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is also present in the Zagreb neighbourhood of Jarun whereas Jehovah's Witnesses have their headquarters in Central Zagreb. In total there are around 40 non-Catholic religious organisations and denominations in Zagreb with their headquarters and places of worship across the city making it a large and diverse multicultural community.\nThere is also significant Jewish history through the Holocaust:  History of the Jews in Croatia - Wikipedia\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nImportant branches of industry are: production of electrical machines and devices, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, food and drink processing. Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe. Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor, INA, Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city.\nThe only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka burza), which is located in Eurotower, one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers.\nAccording to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at $32,185 and $27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of $18,686 and $15,758.As of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna, about \u20ac870 (Croatian average is 5,679 kuna, about \u20ac740). At the end of 2012, the average unemployment rate in Zagreb was around 9.5%.\n34% of companies in Croatia have headquarters in Zagreb, and 38.4% of the Croatian workforce works in Zagreb, including almost all banks, utility and public transport companies.Companies in Zagreb create 52% of total turnover and 60% of total profit of Croatia in 2006 as well as 35% of Croatian export and 57% of Croatian import.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Highways ====\n\nZagreb is the hub of five major Croatian highways.\nThe highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, and forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu\u010dko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.\nA3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa. It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe. Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori\u010dan border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Vara\u017edin \u2013 \u010cakovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes. The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu\u0161kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai\u0107 Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east\u2013west arteries, former Highway \"Brotherhood and Unity\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba\u010dka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.\n\n\n===== Bridges =====\nZagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are:\n\nThere are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi\u010devec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre\u0161i\u0107 (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east).\nTwo additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nPublic transportation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail.\nThe public transportation company ZET (Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\nThe national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice, H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.\nThe funicular (uspinja\u010da) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction.\nTaxi market has been liberalized in early 2018 and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n\n===== Tram network =====\n\nZagreb has an extensive tram network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30\u201350 kilometres per hour (19\u201331 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon\u010dar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T\u017dV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \"TMK 2200\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.\n\n\n===== Suburban rail network =====\n\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east\u2013west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor\u010dek was closed in the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Air traffic ====\n\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft. The airport had 2,77 millions of passengers in 2016 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers.\nZagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu\u010dko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu\u010dko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.A third, small grass airfield, Bu\u0161evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nZagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia. There are 5 public higher education institution and 9 private professional higher education schools.\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nFounded in 1669, the University of Zagreb is the oldest continuously operating university in Croatia and one of the largest and oldest universities in the Southeastern Europe. Ever since its foundation, the university has been continually growing and developing and now consists of 29 faculties, three art academies and the Croatian Studies Centre. More than 200,000 students have attained the Bachelor's degree at the university, which has also assigned 18,000 Master's and 8,000 Doctor's degrees.\nAs of 2011, the University of Zagreb is ranked among 500 Best Universities of the world by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities.\nZagreb is also the seat of two private universities: the Catholic University of Croatia and the Libertas International University; as well as numerous public and private polytechnics, colleges and higher professional schools.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nZagreb \u2013 Official website\nZagreb Tourist Board\nVisit Zagreb - Travel Guide\nZagreb Fair\nZagreb International airport",

        "wiki": "The Croatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art (Croatian: Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti) is a fine art museum in Zagreb, Croatia dedicated to the work of na\u00efve artists of the 20th century. The museum holdings consist of over 1,900 works of art - paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints, mainly by Croatians but also by other well-known international artists in the genre.\nFrom time to time, the museum organizes topics and retrospective exhibitions by na\u00efve artists, expert meetings and educational workshops and playrooms.The museum is located on the first floor of the 18th-century Raffay Palace, 350 square metres (3,800 sq ft), in Gornji Grad at Sv. \u0106irila i Metoda 3.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 1 November 1952, the Peasant Art Gallery (Selja\u010dka umjetni\u010dka galerija) was founded in Zagreb. By 1956 it was known as the Gallery of Primitive Art (Galerija primitivne umjetnosti), and was then part of the Zagreb Municipal Galleries (today the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb). Since 1994, in line with a decision by the Croatian Parliament, its title has been the Croatian Museum of Naive Art. From the very beginning the establishment was organized and run according to strict museological principles, and is deemed to be the world's first museum of naive art. According to the Croatian Ministry of Culture, those principles include:  systematic collection, preservation, restoration, conservation, presentation and permanent protection of museum objects from the jurisdiction of the museum.\nSince 1997, the museum has undertaken many pedagogical ventures. Since 2002, the museum has concentrated on outreach to schools and the student public and intensified teaching each year in the period just before international museum day, 18 May. For this day, the museum organizes educational exhibitions, workshops and brochures geared toward younger audiences in order to educate and increase museum visitation.\n\n\n== Na\u00efve art in Croatia ==\nNa\u00efve, or primitive art is a distinct segment of the art of the 20th century. In Croatia, na\u00efve art was at first connected with the works of peasants and working men, ordinary men and women, of whom the most successful, over the course of time, became professional artists. Na\u00efve art assumes the work of artists who are more or less self-taught, painters and sculptors with no formal art training, but who have achieved their own creative style and a high level of art. An identifiably individual style and poetic nature distinguishes the Na\u00efve from other \"amateur\" painters and sculptors, and from the general self-taught artist. The view of a Na\u00efve artist will usually display unusual proportions and perspective, and certain illogicalities of form and space. Such characteristics are the expression of a free creative imagination, in a similar way to other 20th-century art movements such as Symbolism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism.\nIn Croatia, Na\u00efve art is also seen as a democratic movement, as the movement proves anyone can create worthwhile art regardless of formal training. Within these art forms various the emotive qualities of works are often more visible than any reigning form of logic or reason. Common themes include: \"the joy of life,\" \"forgotten nature,\" \"lost childhood,\" and \"wonder at the world.\" However, Na\u00efve art does not only reflect positive aspects of life, and dark and tragic themes can also be found within the genre.Na\u00efve art first appeared in Croatia at the beginning of the 1930s when the Zagreb Art Pavilion showcased an exhibition of the artists' association entitled Country (Zemlja) on 13 September 1931. Of the artists exhibited, two particularly stood out: Ivan Generali\u0107, who showed three drawings and nine watercolors, and Franjo Mraz, who exhibited three watercolors. The artists sought to show that talent does not only reside in certain social classes or privilege and started the association with na\u00efve art and paintings of villages or by artists from the countryside rather than cities. Themes in Croatian na\u00efve art branched out in the 1950s from villages to \"personal classics,\" which included architectural monuments and objects and opened a period known as \"modern primitive art.\"\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Croatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art holds more than 1,900 works of art \u2013 paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints. Of those, around 80 pieces are on display, ranging from the early 1930s to the 1980s. The focus is on Croatian artists \u2013 of the celebrated Hlebine School, and a few of the more highly valued independent artists. In addition, artworks of significant artists of other nations are also on show.\nThe collection features early masters of the Hlebine school, with works starting from the 1930s. The renowned Ivan Generali\u0107 was among the first of the naive painters in Croatia to develop a distinctive creative style, and achieve a high professional standard in his art. Other artists from the first generation of the Hlebine school include Franjo Mraz, a contemporary of Generali\u0107, and Mirko Virius, who came to renown a few years later. The stone sculptures of Lavoslav Torti, and those in wood of Petar Smaji\u0107 are the first examples of Croatian na\u00efve sculpture.During the 1930s, social issues dominated, and rural realism is reflected in the early subjects and gritty styles. Later work shows a more idealised landscape that owes more to the imagination than the outdoor scenery. The work of the second generation of Hlebine School artists, such as Ivan Ve\u010denaj, and Mijo Kova\u010di\u0107 date from the 1950s and 1960s, and include burlesque and grotesque figures, as well as works inspired by Biblical topics, with a strong use of colour. The painter Ivan Lackovi\u0107 Croata, known for twilight scenes and distinctive, melancholic elongated landscapes, is considered one of the most brilliant and remarkable draughtsmen in na\u00efve art.The collection also includes the work of independent artists such as Ivan Rabuzin who by the end of the 1950s\u20141960s was creating works of lyricism with systematic abstraction and stylisation. The work of Emerik Feje\u0161 is an example of urban Na\u00efve, with themes of exclusively city scenes and architecture characterized by geometrical composition and vivid, expressive use of colour. Matija Skurjeni, another distinguished artist, created fantasy works with lyrical landscapes with powerful distortions.Artists represented in the permanent collection include:Croatian artists\n\nArtists from other countries\n\n\n== Special exhibitions ==\nThe Museum organises special themed exhibits focusing on individual artists, or to highlight specific aspects of na\u00efve art. Recent such exhibits have included \"Foreign Masters in the Collection\", \"Unknown Skurjeni\", and \"Ivan Lackovi\u0107 / Artistic Experiments\".In addition to themed exhibits in the museum, touring exhibits are arranged to other places within Croatia, and abroad in order to reach out to a wider audience. Artwork from the museum's holdings have recently been on exhibit in Japan (2006), Italy (2002), USA (2000), and Slovakia (2000). It is estimated that over 200,000 visitors saw these international shows.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCroatian art of the 20th century\nList of museums in Croatia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKri\u017ei\u0107, Nada (1982). \"Prvi muzej naivne umjetnosti u svijetu : uz tridesetogodi\u0161njicu rada i postojanja Galerije primitivne umjetnosti u Zagrebu\" (PDF).

          "A small museum but with a wonderful collection of naive art. Not an art form with which I was that familiar so the exhibition was really interesting. Highly recommend.",
          "Stunning exhibition of vibrant art. It is well organised by artist and style in about 5 rooms. There are secure lockers free of charge to leave your coats and other gear during your visit.",
          "Absolutely stunning and beautiful paintings that were painted backwards oil paint on glass by self-taught artists. the images seem to glow. We've gone back to the museum almost every time we are in Zagreb. Well worth one's time!",
          "I stopped here on a whim while walking through Upper Town. Good call, the collection here is just amazing; I was floored. I had never hear of Ivan Generali\u0107, but his work is beautiful and moving. This is a must-see museum if you are in Zagreb.",
          "Stopped in as I was passing by. Some nice pieces, although not very many pieces in total. I would not go out of my way to get here, but it\u2019s a worthwhile stop, to see some local artists",
          "This a rare and oldest Museum of Naive Art in the world, and a best example of creative ingenuity of Croatia. With fascinating colour combination, unusual artworks, sculptures and paintings, this is a feast for lovers of Naive Art as the exhibits include the works of artists",
          "Lovely art by Ivan generalic that I really enjoyed. You must climb several steps to enter, so not very accessible.",
          "Even if you know nothing about the Naive Art movement, you'll find paintings to enjoy in this four room museum. Climb the winding stairs to the upper level to pay for your ticket, and walk into a series of rooms with well-lit and interesting pieces. Even without studying or",
          "There are some outstanding works here - mostly from the mid 1940s to the late 1960s. The works are quite quirky and bring a smile to the face. I liked it so much I returned a few weeks later and purchased some posters of a couple of my favourite pieces.",

          "Some wonderful examples of untutored art. Worth the visit to get a sense of broader area artistic expression",
          "I found this a fascinating little art museum. It doesn't take too long to go through (maybe an hour?) but the contents are both haunting and fascinating. I had not much exposure to this art form--I especially appreciated the description of the collection in the museum's pamphlet",

          "Visited this museum mainly because it was just starting to rain, but so glad we did. A relatively small collection but many of the works were quite magical. Some art is best viewed not too close up but some of the detail in these works deserves close examination and",
          "Interesting but not my kind of thing. Oil on glass was different and can have very striking colors 25 kuna each to get in so kind of pricey",
          "I was quite annoyed by the first two rooms and contemplated requesting for a refund until I was explained to me that the artists are all self trained and potentially illiterate. Things warmed up by the time I got to the last two (of four) rooms and found some rather touching",
          "This was a surprising museum with great examples of Naive Art styles on display. It was much bigger than I initially realised, and worth a look if you are interested in art and this interesting style. There was an artist working on a piece who explained the process it takes to",

          "A small exhibition of a type of art that was famous in the 60s and 70s in Zagreb. The style of art didn't really grab me. Probably only suits art enthusiasts who appreciate all types of art. Otherwise not really missing much of you don't go.",

          "I never even new that there was something called naive art so I thought let's give it a try. We were greeted by a very nice lady that spoke many languges and kindly explained where the toilets were, where to put our bags and gave us a small brochure that serves as a guide around",
          "This small museum of works by self-taught artists is worth a visit if you\u2019re in Zagreb. There are very good explanations to go with the art, such as explaining why most of the landscapes are set in the winter. It takes about 30 minutes to view.",
          "This musem has a well-organized collection of niave art accompanied by a very helpful overview brochure that is available in multiple languages. There are also some interesting art-inspired gift items that are unique, of decent quality, and reasonably priced.",

          "Located close to the top of the funicular this small upstairs gallery proved a delight. There are only around 80 exhibits on display but I was captivated by the vivid colours and the distinctive detailed execution. The entry price was well worth it. The paintings left a lasting",
          "The museum displays works by untrained peasant artists which became known as the Naive Art movement, a style largely restricted to Croatia. There are around 80 paintings all housed on one floor including several by the leading exponent of this genre Ivan Generalic. The paintings",
          "A couple of people recommended that we visit this museum, so we went and had a look. We are not at people, but we appreciate the time, effort and skill that goes into painting. I have never seen oil on glass painting before, the depth of colour and detail 8n some of these",
          "We dropped in here on a whim not knowing what to expect. The artwork was evocative. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it after I left - it was very soulful. Recommended!",
          "Nice museum in the old town. The collection is rather small but really good. Some beautiful pieces of Croatian na\u00efve art. One of the few art museums that even my kids appreciated.",
          "I enjoyed the quirky nature of the exhibits and also found that there were spinoff stores in the city selling merchandise.My favourite pieces were semi-grotesque hand puppets.",
          "The museum's Exhibition is not that big, but the quality of the pieces shown are of very high quality. Every visitor receives a pamplet about the Exhibition and the artists and their background, and that is so useful! We got it in English but I would think that the pamplet is",
          "We all fell in love with an artist we had never heard of before visiting this place - Ivan Generalic. A small museum, maybe slightly expensive (80 kunas for family of four) but when we finished we all wanted to buy postcards from the museum shop of art we had just seen.",
          "The art work is very different and extremely interesting even if your not an art lover. Staff were friendly and helpful, taking photographs is allowed. Access however is up a flight of stairs.",
          "We enjoyed visiting this intimate museum. The art is very easy to view as the space is small and comfortable. Lovely way to fill in a rainy afternoon.",
          "This is small (5 rooms) but very interesting. I had the Rick Steves guide which had some interesting background. We spend about an hour and felt it was very worthwhile.",
          "This is a very small museum, but is so worth visiting, i particularly loved the painting on glass, the colours were so vibrant, and just because the Art is classed as Naive Art, it is still very complex and very detailed. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "A friend had recommended that we visit this museum when in Zagreb. The works of art were painted by farmers who had no formal training as artists. Many of their paintings are of landscapes and scenes of farm life. They are quite fascinating and beautiful. We loved this museum",
          "A nice small museum in old town. Nice naive paintings. Enjoyed our visit and would recommend if you have spare time in Zagreb.",
          "First of all, naive art refers to art made by untrained artists (which I have always heard referred to as outsider art). This museum, though small, features some absolutely fantastic examples of Croatian outsider art. I loved it. The space is quite small so they are only able",
          "The Croatian Museum of Naive Art is a small, but interesting museum. It displays a variety of art from artists with no formal art training. It also has a very small gift shop.",
          "Only went in as it is one of few museums open on Mondays in Zagreb. Small and uninteresting and on first floor.",
          "What a cool little museum dedicated to predominantly Croatian artists of Naive Art. As it is small museum, your visit will be short. We really enjoyed it and the tour given by the museum expert. Highly recommend a visit.",
          "Not to be missed if you are an art lover or not. These pieces are meant to speak to the non-artist. Paintings and scupltures speak from the heart and soul. No pomp here.",
          "Really enjoyed the \"docent\" who gave a fantastic explanation of the type of Naive Art. Great view of the local artists. Not too much but a great sampling.",
          "This small museum turned out to be one of our favorite places in Zagreb. I wasn't familiar with Naive art in general or any of the artists but have fallen in love with the style. After travelling Europe for couple years, we sometimes get a bit museum-weary but this was",
          "We had headed of this museum and the Naive movement before arriving in Zagreb so it was a nice surprise to find it the perfect museum for travelers. It is small, easy to navigate and can be done in half an hour to an hour. Much of the best pieces are closest to the front of",
          "We did not know what to expect from \"naive\" art, and were just blown away by the small but fantastic collection.",
          "Located near the St. Mark' s Square I came across the building that houses this museum. At the entrance, I enjoyed the signage on the walls about arts and the colorful planters at the center of the entrance. Since I have 2 more days in Zagreb, I decided to visit this museum",
          "Small museum primarily highlighting Croatian more rustic art. Very interesting in US comparison more in the Grandma Moses style. Only cost about $4 and nice air-conditioned spot in Uptown.",
          "This place in the Upper Town is interesting and quite different to the norm for an art museum. There are not a huge number of pictures but what there is is distinctive in style and the use of colours in some of the paintings is amazing. Well worth a visit.",
          "The period of naive art was about painters that had not studied Art. They just painted. They were discovered. And actually had to paint nights and Sundays because of farm work. So some did not include the face, or the hands. Because that didn\u2019t come out to their satisfaction..",
          "Amazing art that depicts historical times in an interesting art form. The gallery is lovely to walk through.",
          "Our tour guide took us here and we had no idea what it was about. We were a group of 19 people and had a guide who expertly described the very interesting technique of painting on glass in reverse. It was a fully enjoyable experience and was made even better by the coincidence",
          "This museum of Naive art houses the works of art made by naive artists of the 20 th century. This is not a very large collection. These are paintings by amateurs I think. I do not know why it is called naive art. Some paintings are weird. Some look like they have been done by",
          "We visited this museum on a whim.... it was scorching hot outside, we needed to cool down, and this museum was right in front of us. In addition to being nice and cool inside, this turned out to be a delightful little museum. On the surface, this genre of art typically doesn't",
          "Great museum but the number of exhibits is small. Some of the images gifted abilities in reproducing the harsh peasant life in winter. Tip:if walking, use the funicular from the square",
          "It's a really small museum which is quite a shame. Especially considering all those gorgeous displays they had available. Folk artistic expression always struck me with awe... and this time was not different.",
          "This place isn\u2019t as well promoted as some which is a shame because it is absolutely stunning. Not a lot of paintings but what they have is excellent. Well worth a visit if you like naive art.",
          "We were surprised by the small size of the museum. There were some great work but I don\u2019t think I saw enough. Some works that was showed on the promotion paper were not available.",
          "Folk art in its most appealing. You can see where other artists, like Chagall got their inspiration.",
          "I was not expecting much but the Croation naive art took me completely by surpise and I instantly became a huge fan. I wish I had been able to purchase some of the wonderful prints for sale for 25 Kuna but as I was at the start of my trip I would have had to carry them. For the",
          "We saw this museum recommended in the Rick Steves guide book. After a disappointing visit to his also-recommended Museum of Broken Relationships, this was a breath of fresh air. The museum displays works by self-taught artists and explains the stories behind these untrained",
          "You really shouldn't skip this place! It is small and won't take very much time but it is an important stop to make. Our docent was very good and not only talked about the art but thoroughly described how the paintings on glass were made in the traditional manner. Completely",
          "Pretty cool! I loved some of the works, but all were interesting. Some of these artists should've been more well known. Well worth an hour or so to view them.",
          "As a naiive art admirer I took my son to this museum, which is a must. It was very nice, enjoying and educative. The 16 years old loved it, so what more to say.",
          "Museum is interesting, nice and it is really easy to find it. The price of a ticket is cheap, and for a visit of a museum you need less than one hour. This museum is really important and meaningful for Croatian art and cultural heritage, so if you are in Zagreb, do not forget to",
          "Small fee, quaint venue, nice art. It's nice just to walk in the A/C for a few minutes. Doesn't take long to explore. I liked the change of pace. More info and pics at etbtravelphotography blog",
          "Great art work created by artists that I am not familiar with - which made it all the more interesting. All of the art work in the museum is by artists that had no formal training. The museum is small but the art is well displayed. All the information is also in English -",
          "Unbelievable is the only way for me to describe this style of painting. Its hard to believe that the paintings are painted in reverse on glass. They are beautiful when you see them from the front and wonder who thought of this type of painting. Gave me a new respect for this",
          "The museum was small but did a good job displaying the 70 or so paintings in general chronological order. The most enjoyed section at least to me was the early period during the 1930,s and 1940\u2019s depicting the peasant class at work. The museum will only take about 30-45 to see",
          "Very pretty museum showcasing Ivan Generalic and N\u00e0ikifor. It is a fast walk from the funicular (go straight and the museum is on your left).",
          "The paintings on show are really lovely and are well curated. The reception desk staff was friendly and helpful too. 4/5 because I would\u2019ve liked more information on the paintings/context, and other staff were wandering around chatting in what is quite a small space.",
          "This is a gorgeous little museum, attended to by young, extremely knowledgable docents that are art history majors and masters candidates (Zagreb has a prestigious art history college.). The colors, methods and ideas expressed in these paintings are phenomenal.",
          "Oil on glass, you don't realize this interesting fact unless you ask or you have a previous knowledge about this technique however every member of the museum showed a great enthusiasm when I engaged on a pleasant conversation about the Naive art. It was explained to me with",
          "The artists are self taught and have produced beautiful mostly oil on glass paintings. The museum is small but is definitely worth spending an hour or less .",
          "Some nice pieces, some tacky tourist pieces but overall we believed it to be expensive. Staff were helpful though.",
          "You will be amazed by the beautiful original naive art of Ivan Generalic and others. The oil on glass is an art of its own and spectacular.",
          "Only go if you love art. Very small on one floor. About 6 rooms. When I went there were just 2 other people. Very quiet. Small entrance fee. Nicely laid out. Peaceful to appreciate the art. Staff friendly. Took me 20 minutes at a leisurely pace. I enjoyed it. Ony",
          "I've nver been a fan of modern art (most of which is a massive con IMHO) so I went with low levels of expectation to this museum (its actualy more of a gallery), and was very pleasantly surprised. The pictures are mostly of village scenes and have a very appealing simplicity to",
          "I'm not sure why untrained artists are celebrated. Some of them were excellent and other paintings could have been by children.",
          "Interesting and enjoyable visit. Saw a part of peasant life through the paintings. We were intrigued as to why these painters used the reversed glass painting technique for these works.",
          "I went to see a couple of paintings, I did not know what to expect. The place was really friendly, most of the paintings were actually telling a story, some of them reminded me of tales. The usage of colours was exciting, unique, something I haven't seen before. The staff was",
          "Came with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Loved the paintings on glass of the Crucifixion and Moses. Guide was very knowledgeable. Takes only 20 to 30 minutes to see it all. Located in Gradec near St. Mark\u2019s.",
          "Loads of pictures to view. Very colourful. Small shop size. Free and worth a visit. On the main street before the bars start.",
          "This museum is typically Croatian, where you can see the special technique of painting, the most famous painter is Ivan Generalic",
          "This is a great little museum. It doesn't take very long to look through everything, but I did thoroughly enjoy all the artwork there. I hadn't actually seen that type of art before and I was very pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed my time there.",
          "This is a very small gallery for half an hour visit, but is quite something different from what I have seen in other cities. I think it is worth seeing even for those who are not extremely interested in art. Bring your kids!",
          "You can see all of this gallery in around an hour so it fits neatly in to your tour of other nearby museums and St Mark's Church which are all nearby. It gives a good feel for the Croatian mindset so it's worth going to see too!",
          "I liked the art and the low-key display of what is apparently examples of some the finest artists and works within the Croatian Na\u00efve Art style. Self-taught artists from the rural areas painting on the back of glass, displaying the front, a complex technique also know elsewhere,",
          "This museum has a collection of works of the greatest Croatian naive painters, including Ivan Generali\u0107, the most famous of them. There are just a few rooms, so you can make your visit in a quite short time. So if you want to see some genuine Croatian art you shall not miss this",
          "Naive art is very famous art fro Croatians and in Museum you could see all famous painters with very nice paints. Nice guide will tell you all necessary and important things about naive art and explain amazing paints that are there.",
          "This is a small gallery but delivers a big punch. The drawings that represent the lives of the Croatian \"gastarbeiten\" in Germany vary between being angry and being sad but are all passionately felt. The representations of a hard life in the Croatian countryside are very vivid.",
          "We enjoyed a relaxing look around this nice museum. Loved how the artists were Croatian and the staff were nice. Bought postcards and they sell posters, too. They have lockers to put your stuff in when you enter.",
          "A nice little museum in the centre of Zagreb old town with a very interesting selection of paintings and sculptures by Croatian artists. Definitely worth a 30 minute stop when you visit the old town. The staff were friendly and helpful.",
          "It is worth making time to visit this museum/gallery. The art is very good, really interesting. The staff are very knowledgeable and will do their best to answer any questions you may have.",
          "Love the colors painted on glass and the self taught art style. My favorite piece depicts the reaction of the townspeople to a solar eclipse.",
          "I love outsider art and I was pleased to see one in Zagreb. It\u2019s small and can be done in 30 mins. So for that reason, the 25K price is high. But I appreciated the visit.",
          "Small museum with an average visit of 30 minutes. It does however have some really nice artwork to be admired and is a lot better than other galleries in the city.",
          "The space in this museum doesn't allow for a large collection of work but what is there is very interesting to see. We particularly liked how the artists depicted daily life as people went about their business in an agrarian world. We had a chuckle at Martin Mehkek's My",
          "My husband and I really enjoyed viewing all the amazing artworks. It\u2019s not a big gallery, but well worth a visit. I can\u2019t remember how much it cost to visit, but I remember thinking that it was very reasonably priced. You can easily get around to see all the art in an hour. Well",
          "Small museum (five or six small rooms), with paintings from peasants and untrained artists; this is a quick visit but worthwhile.",
          "Yes this museum has over 1900 objects in store. No, only about 70 items - mostly paintings - are exhibited in 6 small rooms. But those paintings that you do see are very nice. Definitely worth the visit. In 30 minutes you will have seen all. It's located near to St Mark's",
          "Like the museum of broken relationships this museum has an interesting concept. It is also located very close to the other museum. You could easily see both in a couple of hours. This museum is small but the fee isn't too expensive. The art was surprisingly good. I would",
          "Extremely interesting artwork to be found at this museum, it is definately a must see on a day trip to Zagreb.",
          "This is a very nice small museum. The entrance fee is 25 HRK, cheap for what you get. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the paintings, not what you expect by \"naive work\". The visit is quick, not even an hour but you will be glad you entered!",
          "This is a small gallery with some very interesting pieces. I highly recommend it if you are visiting Zagreb.",
          "As a long time fan of Naive Art this was a \"must see\" while in Zagreb. The museum has fairly minimal space to display the nearly 2000 pieces they have. We were fortunate to be able to see a few paintings from my favorite painter of the naive school, Mijo Kova\u010di\u0107. There were",
          "Having seen many of the great art museums it was a treat to see something totally different. One is challenged to place this art among the existing schools and periods because it is really just plain folk art with feeling. No fluff no frills. Just think about it.",
          "Located in Upper Town. Cost is fair and relatively low. Mainly paintings. People, landscapes and somewhat Impressionistic in style. Recommend- You can experience a lot in 45 minutes.",
          "A small museum, because of space limits just a little selection of more than 1900 works can be displayed. The works of the master of naive art Ivan Generalic, are displayed amongst which the famous death of the artist Virius. Remarkable works of Emerik Feyes who due to disease",
          "Superbly presented three room gallery highlighting some beautiful 'nai've' style art. Very interesting for art lovers.",
          "I liked that I could see this museum within an hour. It gave a good overview of this art movement and had a good cross section of the key artists, as well as some of their more well known works. Being small there were certainly things I wish could have additionally there, but",
          "The Croatian Musuem of Naive Art is a small but great museum. I didn't know anything about Naive Art from Croatia, but I really enjoyed the museum. The displayed paintings where interesting and expressive and the exhibition made me want to know more about this art genre. A",
          "Great collection of 20th century art from naive style artists. Beautifully curated and displayed. Unusual and worth a visit.",
          "I love Croatian Naive Art so I definitely had to visit this museum! They have a wonderful collection of naive art. It's a wonderful little museum!",
          "I thought there was a typo in my guide book, but nope. It is Naive Art, i.e. not professionally trained artists. I was thrilled with the art AND the small number of pieces. I didn't feel rushed, and I could just really enjoy the quality of some of the pieces!",
          "Quite a surprise thinking they misspelled \"Native\" but it's the non-pro art - which demonstrates tremendous talent",
          "The paintings are beautiful and for sure something different! Through this museum you learn some croatian artists whose work is great! It is a small museum with 4 rooms, so you will not need more than 45 minutes to see it.",
          "We enjoyed the art at the Museum of Naive Art considerably. Not as polished as the art at a fine arts museum, but a lot of it was easy to absorb and the colors (especially the works on glass) were vivid. The works on glass (painted backwards, from the back of the glass) were",
          "This gallery is smaller than I expected, but nevertheless contained a lovely collection of Croatian Art. You could probably spend 1/2 hour at the most here, although some of the work is very interesting. It's a good place to buy postcards, if you don't want to send the normal",
          "A wonderful collection of paintings in the \"Naive\" style rendered on glass. With some oils and pencil drawings to round out the collection. Not to be missed.",
          "An easy, delightful exhibition of lovely \"naive\" (no professional art training) art, some of it truly stunning. Small, accessible, incredibly nice and helpful and knowledgeable guards and wonderful captions all in English. We were some of the only ones there. And OH! I",
          "Contains painting of several artists of naive and weird paintings, worth seeing, and the ticket is not expensive as long as you are going on your own without any tour guide.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this small art gallery. The art is quite different and beautiful. I also bought my son a great T-shirt and mouse pad !!",
          "Probably not for everyone, but if you like folk art, this is a must see museum. Can be seen in less than an hour(plus it is air conditioned), this small museum is worth the small price of admission.",
          "Sometimes you \"force\" yourself to experience opportunities for the sake of diversity rather than out of native interest. The whole concept of Naive Art seemed sketchy to my left-brained engineer's thinking, but all the guide books said to go. So, when in Rome.... I was",
          "I love naive art museums and several of the artists are actually quite sophisticated. Well done, well lighted, and cheap. Don't miss it if you like art",
          "Art painted by self taught artists. Painting on the back of glass starting with front and working backwards. Very interesting and unusual art!",
          "Whether or not you visit this museum depends entirely on if you like Croatian Naive Art. If you do (I do) it's worth a visit as there are some stunning pieces of art. I just wish there were more to see (~6 rooms with ~10 pieces per room). It cost 25 kuna.",
          "The museum contains artwork done by people with no art training. The pieces are lovely. The museum consists of several rooms, all worth seeing. Admission fee is very low.",
          "Learn about Croatian naive art (primitive art). The artist on duty when we went was very helpful explaining how the paintings are completed. Good selection to view and purchase.",
          "A very small museum's with 5-6 rooms exhibiting works of naive Painters. Said to be less or self-taught the exhibition blew me away. Some are really professionally done. And very interesting that some uses layering method and work reversely, oils on glass. Who says only the",
          "This museum is a perfect size to get through in one hour. Just enough and not overwhelming. Great selection of masterpiece paintings and some sculpture.",
          "Our kids (6 & 8) loved the art in this museum. This was art they could be amazed at (oil on glass) and relate to. It gave them the wonderful feeling that the art they make could end up in a museum one day, too. We enjoyed it plenty as well, but their excitement made it excellent",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect with \"naive art\" but it turns out that simply means the artists had no formal training and developed their talents organically (more or less). The art was certainly unique & highly enjoyable. I can't say I know anything at all about art techniques,",
          "We visited this museum at the end of the day. It was a lovely way to end the day. The art is interesting - lots of oil on glass - and these people are masters of the genre. The pieces give you a feel for the history of the place. The museum is small but nicely authentic.",
          "The nicest folk art museum I have ever visited & one of my favorite art museums in the world. Very interesting. Amazing style & detail. Small but incredible.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this exhibition and wished it was larger. Some really interesting pieces and the staff were friendly and helpful. Well worth a visit.",
          "Surprising little gem in Zagreb with many interesting pieces of art. This is a collection like you will never be able to experience anywhere else, and the visit need not be long. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did and would highly recommend you visit!",
          "Small but interesting display of quite a variety of different styles and types of amateur art. You can walk through in 20 minutes, or linger if the art attracts a longer review.",
          "This museum was very manageable to view in less than hour. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Many of the pieces of art were unlike any I've seen in other museums.",
          "This is close to St Mark's and features naive art , which is a key 20th century art movement in Croatia. The artists are self-taught without any formal training and produce highly colourful works often with a political style. It used to be called the Peasant Art Gallery.",
          "This was a pleasant little detour on a cold day, a chance to look at some works I wouldn't otherwise find, and it opens your mind a bit to the Croatian art scene, past & present.",
          "The museum is compact and coherent. I liked it very much, although I am not sure I would have if I didn't know at least a little bit about Croatian Naive Art.",
          "We really didn;t know what to expect and were pleasantly susrprised. The art is most interesting. It is not a very big place but well worth a visit.",
          "A visit to the museum was included in our walking tour of Zagreb. Walked in with very low expectations and was blown away with what I saw. Don't miss it!",
          "Go and spend some time with these beautiful, powerful paintings. The gallery is in the middle of the upper old town. Great to experience something truly Croatian.",
          "This is a must see if in Zagreb. Gives a wonderful perspective and history. Easily can spend over an hour in this very intimate museum. Very near Broken Relationships.",
          "The visit takes about an hour at the most, and expect to see colorful, little-known works of art. we were constantly monitored and followed by two staff-attendants who kept telling us to stay within the zone-markers, who later got annoyed at being questioned about the artworks.",
          "This museum displays some unique art and highlights a traditional method of oil painting on glass so details are put in first and background later. The colors are so vivid because there is no canvas to absorb the paint. Museum is small but so is the price so those not as",
          "Very unusual, small art museum right near the Town Hall. Excellent guide explained the methods and artists of astonishing works. No artists had professional training, but there are fantastic results.",
          "If you are art museum goer, you should definitely stop by this small museum. It's located close to St. Mark church so you can go there while you are exploring the upper town. I have been to numerous art museums in the USA , European countries and Korea and I can say that this",
          "This is how felt when I entered the first room. I was astonished looking at such paintings. It was my first visit to a gallery that had naive art. And I was conquered, Those artists are geniuses especially Ivan Lackovic and Ivan Generalic. I could have stayed hours looking at",
          "This was one of our highlights in Zagreb. A very manageable museum (5-6 rooms), with an incredible collection of mid-century naive art. Which is.....? Not in the avant-garde of Western Art, but not Eastern Bloc realism either. Certainly in the modern tradition. Rich textures and",
          "I went in as it was on my travels, it is quite small but well worth a look. It has some really interesting art which I spent quite a while looking at, artists are mostly from Croatia and you get a real feel for how people lived in Croatia. If you have the time I would suggest",
          "If you can appreciate art, then this place is for you. It is not a large museum and you can \"knock it out\" in an hour. However, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Yes, it is a bit expensive for the amount of art on display, but it is worth a visit. You can see everything at a leisurely pace in about 30-45 minutes.",
          "If you like naive art, don't miss this museum that has some masterpieces of the best croatian naive (and others) painters!!",
          "The gallery is only about 4 rooms. You will see more Na\u00efve art at an art store. Got in and we were the only guests in the gallery. Went into the first room and were followed by two female employees who were talking like they were outside. As we went to the second room they",
          "Easy to find, central location and small collection. Doable for families and others (except persons with limited mobility). Unusual, memorable, delightful.",
          "This place is worth going to. But you should google Na\u00efve Art before going. It's all Na\u00efve Art so you will not find any other styles of art. But that having been said it is wonderfully colorful and historical in it's own way, it's mainly about rural life and some is very",
          "The \"naive art\" style is almost child-like, Grandma Moses style to the U.S. eye. It seems to be a pure expression of the local culture, so was just right for us as we wanted to learn more about this country. Takes no more than an hour to go through, and was well worth the",
          "5 rooms of esoteric primitive art. OK for a quick 30 minutes. No French masters here. There aren't any great museums in this city so relatively speaking it's as good as any.",
          "If you do, there are 5 rooms. A some of the colors are amazing. Photos without flash are allowed. It is a quick stop.",
          "I am honest that I do not know much of Naive Art. In fact I have to look it up in Google after I started browsing the art pieces since I were not able to find a cohesive art form. Then we noticed one of the paintings were used as a back drop in our hotel (Sheraton). I guess they",
          "This is a small but very interesting museum. You can experience simplicity and an artist's vision of everyday life or tourists monuments. These paintings are full of life and very colourful. It is worth exploring this museum.",
          "This is my favourite Zagreb museum.Yesterday I again took friends from Canada to this hidden gem. They say it is one of the most popular in Croatia in the season, but out of season it is a perfect place to step back in tome and see Croatia from the eyes of 'naive artists'.",
          "The Croatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art is a small-ish space filled with a wonderful art collection that I found extremely compelling. I'm no art expert, so I found it useful to read up on na\u00efve art before my visit (the definition is a bit complex but seems to be art that's done by",

          "We visited upon a friend's recommendation and loved every minute of it. The art work is stunning and if you are looking for gifts for friends who appreciate the unusual, the tee shirts are just the thing. We were able to find many that communicated both the art work and the",
          "This museum features known but not famous artists who have different and unique painting techniques and visual displays. Wonderful experience.",

          "I had never heard of Naive Art until I visited this museum but was pleasantly surprised and glad that I did. The artwork is charming and not what I expected. Well worth a visit.",
          "I had no background on na\u00efve art when I entered the museum and had no idea what to expect. What a nice surprise! The artwork is intriguing and the tour guide did a fabulous job explaining the art form and interpreting the displayed artwork. The small museum is a gem and just",
          "This small museum is charming. It's divided into several rooms where you will see a wonderful bit of history captured in an art movement described as \"na\u00efve\". The art displayed demonstrates several different artistic approaches to this type of art.....reverse glass technique",
          "Zagreb card gives you almost no discount here but here is the only place in the world where you can see LOCAL naive art. Fabulous ones. Very small museum with about 5 small rooms but every room is filled with what we considered treasures of folk arts. Time and money worth",
          "These artists really know their play of colors. Wonderful and amazing works on display. Talent can not be contained !!!",
          "Was very quiet when we visited which was nice not a big museum, but worth a visit. There are not loads of exhibits, but something different",
          "Really small museum but very cheap especially for students. Staff all seemed very friendly. Some interesting works - Completely new style to me but worth a visit. Passed an hour.",
          "I really loved this museum! It's pretty small but you get a good guide with information to take you through the different rooms. Plus the staff are really friendly and knowledgeable so will happily give more details if you ask! The art is something a bit different and I found it",
          "A small venue, and tickets only $3. We were surprised how enjoyable this was. Beautiful 'folk art', inspiring my husband to take too many photos.",
          "Upper town. Very surprised with the use of brilliant color and adorable depictions. Mainly 1960s-1970s. Takes less than 30 minutes to see everything. I felt like it was worth seeing the talented artists.",
          "This is an interesting little museum that doesn't seem to get the respect it should. It ain't the Louvre, but there's nothing wrong with that. It's fun to see art other than the great masters, and this museum is worth an hour's stop; I suspect even kids would enjoy it...",
          "It is not a lot but you tended to appreciate art more when there are few. It is more contemporary art by famous Croatian artists.",
          "Have been to a few naive art style galleries and although the diversity of them is part of the charm, I can sometimes leave without the feeling that the exhibits really flowed. Here this was not the case and I discovered several artists and a couple of themes which have stayed",
          "If you have any interest in \"folk, or outsider\" art, this is definitely worth a stop. The building isn't quite museum quality, but the artwork makes up for it.",
          "I loved this art museum! I saw it had good reviews online and am in Zagreb for a bit, so decided to stop over and check it out. The artwork is so amazing, all done by self-taught artists, some of which didn't finish elementary school. There are all different kinds of pieces: pen",
          "What an amazing discovery! All artwork is done by self-taught artists. It is unbelievable what work they could do. True that a lot looks primitive, but a story the work tells.",
          "This was great. Winding rooms, a useable bathroom, and art by the \"common\" man or woman. It was fun to look at each piece and pick our favorite and least favorite. We also recommend taking your student card for a sizeable discount!",
          "Tiny little \"museum\", more the size of a gallery. Lovely naive art paintings. If you end up loving Rabuzin make sure to wander over the main lobby of he Sheraton in town, which has a magnificent gigantic (and I mean gigantic) landscape of his.",
          "One of those places which I would never think I could visit, where instead I ended up in a rainy day after suggestion from some local people, and I'm glad I did! The small museum presents this traditional type of Croatian art in a nice way and the paintings are quite",
          "Small enough to enjoy quickly. Our guide was very knowledgeable. Paintings gave insight into Croatian country life.",
          "Amazing art - cannot believe that none of the artists were trained. Their skill is apparent, and seeing their art and reading about the artists - I feel like I learned more about the country.",
          "If you do not wish to drag our children through large museums, this place is perfect. Very small but with a selection of paintings that will give your children an idea of the art form behind naive art. And with a small entry fee it doesn't matter that the visit is over after",
          "The artwork and story that the artist told through his artwork was well worth seeing. A staff member walked us through the museum and explained the meaning of the work. We got to really appreciate what life was like at that time.",
          "When you think about the premise behind this art, the methodology, the intensity, and the labor ... you have to love the art in this small museum. It is a total gem --- don't miss this one! (Yes, they sell postcards and tee shirts --- very good ones!)",
          "A very nice collection of the work of folk artists. Professional and not touristy or camp. Good gift shop with cards and catalogs",
          "I went to this museum based on the opinions written by other tripadvisor users and it was splendid! I went there on my last morning in Zagreb and I'm happy I did. One of my favourite places in the city!!",
          "My tour group had a stop here as part of our city tour. Very small place, only 4 display rooms. Reminded me of folk art in the U.S. Not sure of the value since our guide took care of that.",
          "Croatian Museum of Naive Art is the oldest of its kind in the world. It really is a fantastic place guaranteed to put smile on your face. It has only 80 exhibits on display, but, on a positive note, almost every exhibit did grab my attention. Excellent!",
          "Nice collection. It took us only 10 minutes to cover the museum. Good for at lovers. Ticket is 25 Kuna.",
          "I was fascinated by all of the paintings created by untrained peasant artists. The colours are vibrant and the scenes captivating. It was hard to imagine that these beautiful works of art were painted by peasants who had no formal training, and even harder to imagine that the",
          "Really enjoyed wandering round this little gallery. Just big enough to justify the fee, small enough to keep you interested. The art on show is accessible as it's na\u00efve so anyone can appreciate it. A few gems in there that we got post cards of. I'd recommend to anyone who",
          "One of our local guides recommended this small art museum and we were so glad that we took her advice. The art on display was amazing -- the artists may not have been \"classically trained\" (thus the name of \"naive art\") but that does not diminish the quality of the work",
          "Croatian Naive Art and the museum itself are refreshingly simple and heart-felt. My husband and I have been to many wonderful museums around the world, but there was something special in these colorful, on-glass paintings by artists who simply paint the landscapes, people, and",
          "Galleries, though small, are chock full of wonderful art, mostly paintings. Set aside a hour of your Zagreb stay for a visit! A short walk from the Westin.",
          "This is a relatively small art gallery of about 5 rooms, but what a wonderful find it is! The works on display are uplighting and talented. I particularly liked the works by Ivan Generalic and Ivan Lackovic Croata. We also visited the much larger and more comprehensive modern",
          "I went to the museum partly because of the good reviews I saw on tripadvisor. I was rather disappointed by the museum. It is really very small (5 rooms) and there is basically no explanation. I am definitely not a person knowing a lot of naive art so I hoped you would find some",
          "If you go to the upper, older part of Zagreb city, walk or catch the vernicular tram to the top and there are quite a few attractions, including a great view of the city plus this small art gallery are just two. The gallery is worth the small entry fee to see the art work, many",
          "This turns out to be one of the best museums I have ever visited. I spent quite a bit of time enjoying the paintings and looking at them in detail. Really unique, recommend it as something to do in Zagreb. We had a day to kill there when traveling.",
          "The museum is little (only 5 rooms), but very representative of the na\u00efve movements. You can see very different kind of painting: some of them seem pictures taken from child books, others seems illustration of a fantastic world, also when they represent tales of common life.",
          "Loved the collection that they had on display here. It was a good introduction to the naive art movement in Croatia. Went nuts buying the postcard reproductions. The staff were helpful in giving information about the artwork, although there is a brochure as well. Really loved",
          "This museum is small and not as well-publicized as it should be. The artists did not have formal training, but the paintings are interesting and high quality. The primary theme is farm scenes. It's a quick visit that is definitely worthwhile.",
          "Tiny entrance leads to a great collection of what I would call \"primitives\" Colorful and fanciful local art. Lots of variety from the artists",
          "Small, second floor located right off St. Mark's square. Primitive art which was quite fun to look at. Small museum and worth the 20 hrs to get in.",
          "The artwork exhibited showed the human painted to be ordinary folks than the well to do family. The artist interpretation of daily life is amazing. Most of the art pieces were done on glass by reverse painting technique.",
          "I liked this lovely museum with is Na\u00efve Art by the Croatian painters. This colorful paintings are really bursting with the joys of life.",
          "We went to this small museum based on the recommendation of Rick Steves. The art is colorful and interesting. It gets it unique color and quality by being painted on glass. There is a brochure in English that is helpful. The Rick Steves guidebook gives a lot of information",
          "Very small museum that is very well organized. I really liked some of the paintings and as there is not much info there do your research ahead of time.",
          "beautifful spot to visit. we were delighted by Zagerb and its surrundings. we will be back for sure.",
          "I loved this small well-organized museum of striking naive art. Caution: set of winding stairs to access the museum. Small gift shop includes postcard reproductions of the paintings.",
          "Whoever curated the collection put together a startlingly varied assortment of interesting work. If you like \"outsider\" or folk art, you'll love this place. It would have been nice if they offered more context around the paintings. As a non-Croatian, none of the artists were",
          "This small museum presents a wonderful collection of Croatian primitive art. It is hard to believe that the artists are self taught. The pieces showed a great deal of imagination and skill. We walked up a flight of stairs to enter the museum. Not sure if there is an",
          "The museum is small but has some beautiful works of naive art and we really enjoyed mooching around it! Would go back again, as I suspect that they rotate their works.",
          "Fascinating art collection. I was mostly intrigued on how they painted these paintings. Most where one on the back of glass so the artists had to paint opposite to what you normally paint. The art is a mixed collection of landscapes, portraits, buildings and a mix of strange",
          "A lovely little gallery of interesting paintings. Well worth stopping by if you like a more contemporary and accessible style of art. Or if you just like colour.",
          "There were some wonderful artists displayed here. Pity there is not more space as not all the collection can be displayed. I enjoyed it.",
          "It is a very small museum with around 1000 artwork and paintings. This is a collection of some Na\u00efve artists of Croatia. My favorite among them is Ivan Rabuzin",
          "A really nice compact museum of Na\u00efve Art: self taught modern art. While this museum is very compact there are some great exhibits. This art is really colourful and bold with a variety of artists, styles and subjects. The inexpensive cost makes a visit to this well laid out",
          "I decided to give it a chance but ultimately I'm not a fan of naive art, so I mostly looked at the wood sculptures and counted how many paintings included 'snow on the roof of a hut'. It's a cozy museum and for 25kr (less than \u00a33) it's a good place to visit without feeling",
          "This museum is small but quite lovely. The style of many of the paintings is reminiscent of Brueghels depiction of peasant life.Ivan Generali\u0107 was one of its founding artists painting in a naive peasant style.Some of his unique art is displayed.",
          "I loved this small, intimate gallery that showcased the na\u00efve art of Croatia. Anja, the young woman who was working there when I visited, spoke wonderful English. She was helpful and very well informed as well as quite charming.",
          "In this museum you need to know the local language or English and like to read because museum is build around a number of objects together with a text to read to understand the story",
          "Intrigued by the name (not being an art lover), my friend encouraged me to come with her one rainy day. Even though it's not my kind of art, once she told me how some of the more vibrant ones were done, it made me appreciate them so much more. Oil on glass reverse painting -",
          "It has very short opening times so I made sure to be there within the slot. Six rooms with a great variety of naive paintings. Hardly any visitors so you can take your time and go at a leisurely pace. In the middle of Old town.",
          "This museum is in a shop with tacky souveniers but has a wonderful collection of Croatian Naive Art priced quite reasonably. I bought a small piece to bring home. The paintings on the back of glass depicts early croatian scenes painted by untrained artists. it is a protected",
          "This little museum is worth stopping at. The art is beautiful and you can buy something special as a momento. Very interesting application methods on glass. Fascinating and lovely chatting to the owner.",
          "a small but wonderful museum, nicely laid out, you can see the development of the style, and staff are very helpful.",
          "Naive paintings are developed in the emotions of the artist rather than in the classroom. None of these artists had any training, yet ,,in many ways their works rival the masters we all know so well. A must see in Zagreb.",
          "Small very well organized Museum of naive art aloud to the travellers to get brief but bright impression of local and international naive artists You will spend not more than an hour, but will remember those images much longer",
          "It is a small and very nice museum, demostrating Croatian naive art, located in the heart of the old upper part of the center. Nicely laid out, small but interesting! Paintings are on the back of glass. I found many of the paintings extremely beautiful and interesting! A nice",
          "i took some guests here and i was surprised how lovely this museum is, although small it represents some of fine croatian art, that is very local and specific, my guests loved it so did i, several pieces in their shop are good souvenire from zagreb",
          "It is a cozy interesting museum. If you want to know more about Croatia art, it is a place to visit. The paintings are beautiful to me and easy to understand.",
          "The museum housed a collection of paintings done by untrained (naive) artists who draw from their daily experience in life. The color was vivid and the painting told stories. The painting technique was unique to Croatia and it was really interesting, it's a must see place in",
          "I have always admired Croatian Naive Art and when I found myself in Zagreb, it was a must see for me. This museum was small ,intimate and so beautiful I'm sure that if it was bigger I would not have had the..Wow ... So glad I saw this one",
          "Filled with naive--but famous--paintings and \"plastic\" (sculptural) works of art showing how traditional Croatia lives and thinks. This relatively small museum is a jewel. Staff members are kind, patient, good-humoured. Good little gift and book shop.",
          "A nice contrast to the classical art museum, the displays of Croatian naive art are lovely and intimate.",
          "The amount of sophistication and refinement to be found in many of the exhibits in this museum are remarkable. Naivete is subjective and some of these works are remarkably intelligent and mature. I think you will enjoy it.",
          "This museum, although the size of a large apartment, has some of the best and most intriguing art work in Zagreb. You will spend much more time than you think at this venue given the complexity and beauty of the paintings. I think that this one place gave me a better",
          "This is a very small museum but the art it contains will amaze and thrill you. The guide is very knowledgeable and they speak very good English.",
          "I happened to pass this little museum so not knowing much about naive art I decided to give it a whirl. I found out that naive art simply means self taught. Most of these painters had a farming background and that's why many of them are set in winter cos they're too busy farming",
          "If you have an even vaguely interest in folk art, outsider art, naive art, or any unconventional art by untrained artists with an unique perspective then stop by this small but amazing museum. I only wish they had more rooms to show more of their fantastic and unique collection.",
          "First, I had no idea that an entire movement involved painting on glass. It's striking how incredible some of these look. Some look almost three dimensional. It's quiet, nice and one of the best things we saw while in Zagreb.",
          "The Croatian Museum of Naive Art is a really worthwhile experience if you are interested in art and haven't been exposed to this form before.",
          "Loved the paintings. Wish it was more extensive and wish more posters of the beautiful artwork were available.",
          "It's a little museum which only deserves a visit if you are in love with naive art or have spare time to spend. Anyway it's a cheap visit so probably you won't regret spend the money.",
          "After visiting the broken relationships museum, and not being too taken with that, we walked a hundred feet down the block to this museum, and we were really impressed with this collection of naive, or primitive, art from local peasants. Some of the paintings are extraordinary",
          "Our group of four visited today. We were quite impressed by the art. The young Roman working at the counter in the shop was eager to explain the art and answer questions. She gave a recommendation for lunch - Grandfather's Dream - (not Croation name) which was close by and very",
          "Great visit to one of the best museums in Zagreb. The technique used to create the art is so unusual - painting on glass, gives fantastically vibrant results. Really loved it and purchased lots of postcards to frame",
          "Definitely worth a look! Unique, folky addition to the trip. The rooms are small and the museum can be completed in half an hour or so. Great rainy day activity for us. It was cool to see oil on glass, which we had never seen before.",
          "Thought it was a typo and was the Museum of Native Art, but found out Naive is correct and means \"not formally taught\". It is similar to folk art and unique and refreshing. Croatia has a lot of creativity and much is in evidence here. Worth seeing as well in galleries that are",
          "For a country that has experienced so much in terms of change, wars, hardships, this exhibition is a bit of fresh air.",
          "Na\u00efve in this context means 'not formally taught'. Some of it's a bit meh, but most is surprisingly good; a couple down right excellent. The technique is mostly 'oil on glass' which has a distinctive attractive look. Miles better than the exhibitions at the Klovi\u0107evi dvori",
          "I was amazed at the range and quality of the works on display here. Especially the paintings done on the back of glass! The two young ladies monitoring the displays also provided interesting explanations. Well worth a visit.",
          "This small but interesting gallery should be on your list of must see things to visit in Zagreb. The paintings are displayed in a series of rooms. The brochure is very helpful and should be read as you tour the gallery. Great collection of postcards to purchase.",
          "Fascinating art - small museum so can be seen within 30 minutes. Wish gift shop had more prints to choose from for purchase.",
          "This was my favourite museum in Zagreb, partly because one of the room attendants was so enthusiastic and interested herself and really improved my experience. Just the right size as well. Last but not least I loved the paintings and sculptures.",
          "This is worth a stop to see the native art collections. Many beautiful pieces and a nice stop while exploring downtown",
          "Loved this small, three room, museum. It can be easily viewed in 1/2 hour. Many of the pieces were oil on glass instead of canvas, which we hadn't seen before. Website says it is closed on Mindays, but in the summer months it is open on that day.",
          "This little gem is not big in any sense -- it's really only five or so rooms. The art itself is often unpretentious as well - scenes of rural life or of nature, with simplistic forms and bright colours. But this is the point, and the charm, of naive art, and I couldn't imagine a",
          "We were really fortunate when we visited that one of the staff was an art student herself who obviously enjoys her job and given she was fluent in English was able to give us a mini-guide to the museum. She explained the different genres to us and stories behind the artists.",
          "A great little museum with staff who go out of their way to be informative and engaging. Postcards of artwork are reasonably priced, so if you like a painting you can have a token to remember it by, as no photos are allowed.It's not the Louvre, but it's worth a visit to see the",
          "Always had interest in primitive art form but this was a fascinating introduction to naive art. Especially enjoyed painting on glass. Artists very creative in expressing their views of the simple life.",
          "I enjoyed this museum because it w work created by everyday people as a result of an interest or hobby. There is some really good stuff here and worth taking g the yi e to have a look",
          "The art in this small museum is so creative and imaginative, it simply blew me away. Days later, specific images still burn in my mind. It's a real jewel.",
          "If naive art is your thing, you must visit. A hike to upper town will leave you envigorated and ready to feast your eyes on this lovely art expression",
          "A real gem of a museum, though I really don't think the art should be called naive. It's astonishingly good.",
          "I saw the place on a travel show (Rick Steves...got to admit it.) When I passed by, I just had to go in. Small museum and the entry fee is slight. Quite interesting...go see for yourself....",
          "If you are an art lover or even just interested in art, this is worth a visit. Very unusual and interesting museum.",
          "We went on our last day. The museum is small with beautiful examples of folk art, glass painting, a few wood carvings, but is greatly enhanced by the guides who obviously love the works and have lots of enthusiasm and information to share. This is art created by the workers and",
          "The unusual art form consisted of painting on reverse side of glass. Creative and beautiful colors of an artwork that is rarely seen anywhere",
          "This is a very small museum that can be seen in 20 minutes. Very interesting and well displayed. I wish they had had a bigger selection of souvenirs because they had some really need pictures in the museum.",
          "My husband and I are art lovers and really enjoyed this small museum filled with the best of Croatian Naive Art by the top artists. We were especially grateful to have a young woman from the museum volunteer to be our guide through the exhibit as it really heightened our",
          "Put this museum on your must see list! It was fascinating and worth the entrance fee. Check out the 4 seasons paintings and the trolls!",
          "We really enjoyed this exhibition. Although we enjoy art galleries, this hadn't initially been on our itinerary and we went in on a whim. The genre was really interesting and not one I knew much about. Mostly paintings by peasant artists with no formal education, these were",
          "Never has \"I don't know much about art, but I know what I like\" been more true than when I stumbled across this place on my wandering around the Upper Town in Zagreb. Absolutely loved this collection, which is small but very impressive. I particularly liked the works of Ivan",
          "Obviously artwork is subjective, but I really enjoyed the art they put on display here. While the museum is small with only 4 rooms each holding perhaps 6-10 paintings, I thought it was well worth the 20KN admission for the novel form of domestic artwork you don't usually see",
          "Best part A/C on a hot day, interesting exhibits of Croatian artists and sculptures. These were generally peasant artists and not world renowned.",
          "The museum is in the street that runs from the vehicular to St Marks and is worth the 25 Kunar entry fee. You can take photos without a flash and/or get post card versions of most of the works in the small shop at the entry to the gallery. You won't miss a lot if you don't visit",
          "I would rather say it is Native ar rather than \"naive\", but I found the paintings delightful showing a slice mostly village life around Croatia.",
          "We truly enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Naive Art in Zagreb. The size of the exhibit is small, just a few rooms. This makes the collection more accessible and increases the impact of viewing the paintings. The images created by the several self taught artists in the",
          "You won't find this style of art anywhere else but here in Croatia. Sure there are other na\u00efve art museums, but this style is pure Croatian. It's modern but with Croatian subjects and not really similar to anything else. Don't let the 'naive' fool you. These are well thought",
          "This museum affected me deeply. Not large, about six modest rooms. The first room left me sitting on the bench, journalling about my experience of the paintings, many of the paintings, not just one. I don't react this way ordinarily. I took many photos, also unusual. The work",
          "We love naive art and thoroughly enjoyed the museum (not very big). Only works of Croatian painters and sculptors to be seen, some really stunning (we thought).",
          "very small but i could have spent all day here. very different and very beautiful. the art was extremely interesting to me. ended up buying a piece from a gallery later on, i was so taken with the naive art. highly highly recommend especially if you like folk art or",
          "Who knew how difficult it is for artists to paint on glass? The locals perfected the art, and several beauties hang on the walls, along with several rooms of 'rustic' art done in other forms, including sculptures. Try to have the young lady who helps sell in the gift shop, guide",
          "This museum can't be missed! Excellent selection of naive art and artists. Knowledgeable staff. The art conveys a love for the peasant life and landscape. The artists were not trained, which accounts for the evocative nature of their works.",
          "We enjoyed this little museum immensely. The art was quite interesting ..but a major plus were the knowledgable English speaking guides. We learned alot...not just about the art but also about the history and geography of Croatia. It was an hour or two well worth our time and",
          "A small museum, but so very interesting. So fun to compare the artists shown, and to find out about the Japanese artist, Taizi Harada, who was so taken by the Croatian style. Sorry to realize (by BeTravelish's review) that I missed the Gallery Mirko Virius. Next time!!! It",
          "The art there was very good and worth seeing -- I loved the na\u00efve style of are, but the museum is very small. I saw far more naive art by going to a Gallery of Na\u00efve Art - the Gallery Mirko Virius -- which was just fantastic. I highly recommend going to the Gallery.",
          "This museum is terrific, and small, so you can enjoy a couple of hours here but not feel exhausted by the effort. It's near the Museum of Broken Relationships, which is also small, so you can do both together.",
          "Loved the art -- a small but lovely exhibit -- only problem it is a challenge for physcially challenged -- on the second floor and no elevator have to use a curved staircase. But well worth the effort.",
          "I enjoy my visit to this museum. I really like the style of Croatian naive art, the dedicate, fine, precise brush strokes, the idyllic and romantic country scenes, and the cleanness of the lines. It is a must stop if you are interested in the cultural aspect of Croatia.",
          "Although the issue does not affect me, I approve the Museum for being upfront about not having wheel-chair access. Unusually for me, I was the first visitor of the day, for which I am immensely grateful because the rooms where the artwork is displayed are quite small. Some of",
          "Well worth the low price of admission to this small art museum. It's unfortunate they don't have more space as they have a lot more art in storage. The docent was helpful and spoke English fluently.",
          "This was a form of art I'd never heard about and I was deeply impressed by the creativity and ability of these artisans! Some of the work is humorous ('Goiterous Jana') and other pieces are beautiful: a wide range for a tiny place. The museum is small, clean and quiet: we did",
          "This is the oldest museum of na\u00efve art in the World and it is wonderful, na\u00efve art is apparently art produced by people with no formal artistic training or education. On wandering around this fascinating gallery it is very difficult to believe that the artists on display have",
          "Maybe 25 works of art by unschooled artists. Some are quite good, some are quite charming, some are not so great. We paid the senior ticket price of about $3 so was okay, but I would not pay a lot to go in.",
          "A very nice small museum to visit and see some really interesting art. It wasn't too crowded when we went and we saw some really lovely pieces.",
          "Fascinating visit in a small museum, presenting a nice collection of Croatian naive art, colorful paintings of landscapes and portraits, many of them containing scenes from daily rural life and folklore. Not to miss !!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this tiny museum...we spent about 1.5 hours exploring the paintings, carvings and sketches and learning more about Na\u00efve Art which is quite fascinating. We wish it was a bigger space so they could display more of their collection...that was our",

          "I normally do not enjoy folk- or naive-art as it seems hokey. This museum, on the other hand, opened my mind as the exhibition has some outstanding work, landscapes to portraits, drawings to sculpture. As part of the national art heritage as well as repository of foreign",
          "Although this museum is quite small the art it contains makes it well worth a visit. I know very little of naive art but the style is very unique and unusual. It makes for some beautiful paintings and sculptures which are quite intricate and detailed,",
          "What can I say? I thought it would be charming to explore a museum of naive art, but it wasn't. It struck me as just naive art. My advice? Keep your 20 Kuna entrance fee and spend it at the museum store--they have the best if the art on mouse pads, magnets, t-shirts, lens",
          "A delightful half hour or so appreciating some delightful art works - unusual and clever. Well worth a visit",
          "These Na\u00efve art is unbelievable. Bought a picture in the store. I will not spoil the surprise you will have but assure you it is something you wont want to miss..",
          "Take an hour and spend time in the galleries of the Croatian Museum of Naive Art while in Zagreb's upper city. Artist's provide a window into Croatia and their view of Croatia in the twentieth century. Works of naive artists from other countries also part of the collection. Nice",
          "Worth a visit,more of a gallery than museum, beautiful na\u00efve depictions of Croatia done by contemporary talented artists but this is not folk art.",
          "Many years ago,in 1971, as visiting students from the U.S., my wife and I traveled to Hlebine to meet Ivan Generalic, the first great Croatian naive painter. He showed us some of his paintings over a glass of wine and some snacks. We fell in love with this unique art form, and",
          "A fascinating display of naiive art from a range of Croatian artists. The genre is almost cartoon like in its presentation but features genuine feeling, depth and an amazing amount of detail.Well worth a visit.",
          "Small but very interesting collection of native Croatian painters in Naive style. Bought a print for framing at home!",
          "Very good museum in the upper town. Just a few rooms but a nice selection of Generalic's paintings on glass. Worth a visit",
          "This is a tiny museum, if you like naive art you will be charmed. This is the only museum I went to, as time was very limited, I am happy that I chose this one. Entrance fee is twenty Kuna, will take you twenty minutes max to view the exhibits though!",
          "We spent about 1-2 hours at the museum, it is a bit small but very enjoyable, and has some excellent, local naif artworks, originals. It is a most pleasant museum, bright, airy, and educational The staff were all extremely helpful and most spoke English",
          "The art on review is made often by farmers,rural folk with no art background...Peter Breugel often comes to mind...It is simply so beautiful and such a pleasure to see the art on display..I just wish there was more..much more than the 6 lovely rooms this museum has",
          "Colourful pictures depicting country life, some painted on glass for a luminous finish I hadn't seen before, others abstracted into pretty repeat patterns. The distant scenes were reminiscent of a Croatian Lowry.",
          "This is an indigenous art form that is painted onto mirrors. Per our local guide, rather than pay the money to enter this museum in the upper town, go into the souvenir shop just off Jelacic Square on the way up to the Cathedral and opposite the 3D bronze map of the city of",

          "In this museum you will experience the beuty of croatian naive art. You will be impressed for sure, but this does not take the whole day. One hour is enough. The friendly staff will guide you and give you a nice experience.",
          "This is a great little museum with a unique style of artwork. I had never heard of naive art, but was impressed that everything is done by self taught artists and it's all painted on glass- not canvas. What you'll see is a good representation of the Croatian country side. I",
          "It was great to see a different type of art in a museum, a type of art that I always liked. Great to learn about the beginning of it.",
          "So happy we went there and discovered this art movement. Unlike large museums where staff is nowhere to be found, here you could have a conversation with the staff and discuss the pieces. They were friendly and knowledgeable. I would go back again, on a sunny or a rainy day!",
          "This particular art form of Croatia found immediately its place to my heart when I first saw it and I visited the \"Croatian Museum of Naive Art\" as soon as the opportunity presented itself. I was charmed by the major part of its exhibits and spent quite a time there, although",
          "I liked pieces of croatian naive paintors like Rabuzin, Lackovi\u0107 and Generali\u0107, it was defenitively worth to see and they had a guy who was painting there for pepople some pictures.. and in museum shop the pictures were on sale",
          "I went to this gallery three times because of its whimsical and colourful art,art that is not naive in its perspective.Further,the gallery is in the wonderfully atmospheric old town across from the Museum of Broken Relationships.",
          "Reason I am posting this is to try and make a change. I love Croatian Naive art. I have few pieces myself. However, this museum should be bigger. In a small village of Hlebine in Croatian area known as 'Podravina' there is a same kind a museum that holds master pieces of most",
          "Very evocative artworks, all by unschooled artists. A beautiful collection of unique, soulful works. Highly recommended!",
          "We went. Saw art of a kind I'd not seen before. Extraordinarily compelling art. The exhibition is fairly small, representing only a portion of their collection. We were the only visitors, and I found it fairly unnerving having two staff members follow me into every room.",
          "Climb the stairs to the second floor to find this museum - it's well worth a visit when you're in the upper town. The lighting on the reverse glass paintings really brings them to life. There is a selection of reproduction postcards and a few books availablefor purchase in the",
          "The fact that the people who painted this artwork were painting from their experience and soul, not having been to colleges for art, made it very interesting.",
          "You have to go see it to understand why this is not a place to skip while in Zagreb. Those paintings are so different from everything I have seen; their stories about village life so vivid, so complex!",
          "Naive does not mean primitive. This collection of works by unschooled Croatian artists is outstanding and varied. While it is not large, it is delightful and ranges from works painted on glass to sculptures to drawings. Some depict local village life and events, others are",
          "Remarkable small museum exhibiting Croatian Folk Art painted on glass from the reverse. The process requires multiple applications of oil paint. Staff are eager to explain the process and product is very unique. Worth a visit about 20 Kuna or a little more than 3 dollars.",
          "Liked the variety and quality of the art works on display. Ivan Lackovic-Croata was a featured artist when we visited, and there was a very nice catalog of his work. The small space has so much art, it feels somewhat crowded and hard to appreciate some of the pieces.",
          "We are very delighted at this small museum, the paintings are amazing. I\u00b4ve never been in a art naive museum and didn\u00b4t know many things about this art, but it\u00b4s very beautiful.",
          "If you visit Zagreb, you should definitely stop at the upper towns small museum called Croatian museum of naive art; paintings made on glass; from the behind and in reverse. And they had no art education. Wow. Just wow! Ticket doesn't cost much and even if it did, worth every",
          "OK. Not my cup of tea . Very small but I know there are people who loved it and spent significant time there",
          "A very small museum and can be done in half an hour. It has a mix of nationalities for artists, but most come from rural Croatia. Loved it!",
          "It was nice to learn about Naive Art in Croatia. Really love the permanent exhibit and was easy to go thru with the pamphlet they provide.",
          "I'm not a big art fan in general, but I would definitely recommend swinging by this gem if you have some time in Zagreb.",
          "A quick stop at a small and friendly museum in the upper town of Zagreb. Remarkable oil on glass painting by local artists.",
          "If you have an hour or so to spare and are in the neighborhood, give this gem of a little museum a try. Admission is only 20 kuna. A variety of styles of folk art, some quite intriguing.",
          "This little museum was a lot of fun. \"Naive Art\" is simply another word for folk art. There are many examples of really well done folk art here, and one of the security women offered to give us an enlightening tour and explanation.",
          "Mia, the girl working in the staff, is very knowledgable and good in presenting the background for the naive art coming from Croatia. I was unsure whether or not to attend, but I'm glad I took the trip. Especially the painting from Ivan Rabuzin called \"On the Hills - Primevil",
          "Do not miss this small gem museum in Zagreb's Old Town. Wonderful, imaginative art painted on glass by Croatian artists.",
          "As it is the Museum of Naive Art, thus the artists are from the Naive (they did not have any art education background). Despite that, the arts there are really nice and beautiful. No wonder they won something on Trip Advisor ;)",
          "It's a small museum but very interesting. I really like this kind of painting and I was not disappointed with the artworks exposed, even though it is so small. You will need 1 hour or so to see it, so don't forget to include it into your plantrip! Best upside: not many people",
          "Didn't understand what Naive Art was- but loved it when I saw it- it is art from \"untrained\" artists! Worth a visit!",
          "It's a small place, but a very interesting place with the unique art styles. It took us an hour to see. Cost was about $3.50 US. Be sure to get a brochure. It helps explain Naive art. Definitely stop if you have time.",
          "These paintings are gorgeous, even if you are not an art museum type you should take a peek. The artists have created works of exquisite beauty and provocative subjects, all without formal art training. The museum is small so you can enjoy without getting museum eyes.",
          "I am not really fond of naive art, but I went to see it not to be an ignorant, as it is in my home town and it shows our local art. I liked it a lot. Some artists and works you may not like, but most people will find something they will quite like and I thing it will be",
          "Definitely worth 30 - 40 mins of our time to learn about and appreciate a concentrated selection of Naive art by mostly Croatian artists.",
          "This gallery is up in the old upper town. Its not very big, but we quite enjoyed looking at the unique art on offer",
          "If you are travelling to Zagreb, the excellent Croatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art should not be missed. The museum is tiny -- 4-5 rooms -- and focuses on a handful of artists active in this specific artistic movement. A simple but helpful brochure walks you through the artist's",
          "Very pleasant little museum in the old-town Zagreb, with the local naive-art period on show. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable. Worth the detour.",
          "Small but superb collection of art from the naive movement. Didn't know much about it before but I was impressed. You can buy nice postcards after the visit of almost all of the works.",
          "I'm glad I went here because I learned what Naive Art really is, and how the painting on glass works (the artist has to paint backwards, with the foreground first), which is amazing. However, in Zagreb are many galleries with naive art that you can look at (and buy). I'd suggest",
          "Small museum with beautiful and very special artworks! The museum has great suvenirshop, which is very cheap. Employees are kind and friendly!",
          "I've always enjoyed Na\u00efve art but this is the first time I've come across a gallery dedicated to it. Thoroughly enjoyed it - many pictures are oil on glass which makes them very vibrant. If you like Na\u00efve art I thoroughly recommend.",
          "Rick Steves highly recommends this museum and I am so glad that I followed his advice. This museum can be tackled in 30-45 minutes. Perfect for a taste of art that is purely Croatian. The ticket desk will provide a nice color guide to the museum (in multiple languages) which",
          "I loved my one hour in this museum. It was all new information to me. I had never heard of \"naive\" art before and actually thought it was a misspelling of \"native\". Glad I was wrong. The paintings that most impressed me were the ones done on glass - and the back of the glass",
          "We visited as a part of a guided tour through the city and were much impressed. It provides a great way to experience some art work that would not otherwise be noted. While the subject matter is somewhat repetitious, the reverse painting on glass technique is worth inspection",
          "I had no idea what kind of paintings were considered Naive art before I went, so I was really surprised to see how beautiful some of the paintings were. Lots of colors and interesting subjects. But what really helped make the museum fascinating for me, was the help of one of the",
          "The museum is small but has some excellent art in this interesting art form. The painting is done in oils directly on the back of the glass. Therefore the entire painting has to be done in reverse (details first, then mid-information and finally the sky and background). The",
          "I've liked Naive art since I first saw it in Zagreb about a decade ago. This museum has about 80 pieces (mostly paintings, some sculpture) that give you a nice overview of the style. I'm no art critic, but I really enjoyed walking through here.",
          "I was aware of painting on glass before, but I have never seen glass painting of this quality. It was a real eye-opener and something every art lover should see. Perhaps the term \"naive art\" sounds like it won't be great art, but it certainly is. I was blown away. The young",
          "I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I ended up only spending 20 minutes here. They have some cool paintings, and I pad 10 kunas (student discount). It's up to you really if you want to come. It's not a big museum.",
          "This is a small art gallery (5 rooms) however the impact of the paintings and sculpture is undeniable. Bold, colourful and, at times, grotesque art left us wanting to explore this genre more. Inexpensive to enter. An excellent leaflet explaining a little about the art.",
          "It took a visit to a nearby art gallery to get a complete understanding of the concept of naive art. The museum is well laid out and has a great display of various artist's works. The staff are very respectfully quiet and pleasant. It is a fun museum to visit and definitely",
          "Amazing museum! So different and just great art! The style is so unique. I really did not know what to expect and was so surprised.",
          "We really enjoyed the Museum of Naive Art with its colorful paintings. An informative brochure provided a little bit of background information on many of the artists and their paintings and our experience was further enhanced by the knowledgeable insights and explanations",
          "A style of art we had never seen - knocked us out. Probably the most amazing is Kovacic, but several just incredibe - never saw anything like it. If you have ANY interest in art, go!",
          "Great examples of naive art and not expensive entry. Though only five rooms, they were full of wonderful, colourful paintings using different media. My husband had never known of the style before and he enjoyed it too.",
          "We enjoyed this museum much more than we predicted. It's up a flight of stairs and then has several large rooms of bright artwork. Get a souvenir eyeglass/computer cleaner that depicts one of the paintings at the little shop. Very nice gift for travel.",
          "A totally unexpected technique of painting charming experiences of life in Croatia in this last century. Very talented self-taught artists who will surprise you in very room.",
          "this little gem of a place is not too far from the museum of broken relationships, and is different from the normal art galleries you will go to,lots of cool stuff.i would recommend it.cheap and fun",
          "Didn't expect much but was really surprised. Have one of the 'guards' explain what you are seeing to get a fuller understanding of what this art entails. They are informative and it will help you appreciate what's on display much better. Worth the price of admission!",
          "A small gallery in the upper town by artists who are little known, at least to me! A wonderful collection of colourful paintings, many of which are oil on glass. Helpful staff helped and leaflet helped us get a lot more out of our visit.",
          "the naive art represents the simple subject matter and technique used to produce this beautiful art. there are some amazing colours on the glass and oil paintings that just make you happy. easy to understand art that makes you feel good. a must visit!",
          "We like art museums, but this was more like a gallery than a museum. There were only a few rooms but the style and work was very appealing. This is a great attraction if you are in the upper town and looking for some Croatian culture.",
          "Went there in 2008. It was around lunchtime and the museum personnel was about to close it, but they have been extremely kind and let me in for free (!). It is definitely a must visit if you go to Zagreb.",
          "I love this style of artwork and spent hours at this museum. I also went back again as there was so much to see. Another must visit when in Zagreb. Make sure you have lots of time as it is not a visit to be rushed.",
          "This museum is a \"do not miss it\". 1. The art shown here is unique. It would be hard to find something similar without going out of your way. 2. It is fairly small, so you will not tire yourself out going thru it. 3. It is inexpensive, admission is less than $4. 4. The location",
          "We weren't sure what to expect at the Museum of Naive Art, but we were blown away by the amazing colorful primitive folk art done on glass in reverse mode many by artists with no formal training. This museum is worth seeking out in the upper old town of Zagreb. You won't be",
          "If you are into art this is a must see. If you are not into art, but have the time, I also recommend visiting this museum. Very interesting paintings and some sculptures by untrained Croatian artists from rural areas. Most pieces are from the 1930's to the 1970's. Museum",
          "This is a great art museum, if you are not into art this museum is perfect for you -- just the right of art for you not to get too bored or overwhelmed. If you like art you will enjoy what you see. It is diverse and the quality of the works is high -- you will enjoy it.",
          "As art neophytes we were very pleased by this museum. This is a different kind of art than what we were used to. If you have 30 min or 1 hour, take a look at this place.",
          "Small but very interesting museum. Nice helpful lady at the front desk.You really get an understanding of what croatian naive painting is like.",
          "Small museum in Zagreb with art that shows themes of the common people. Some of it is really good and some just charming. I thought it was worth it.",
          "This museum has many very nice pieces of naive art. Many of the pieces are reverse images on glass. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "The artwork here is absolutely breathtaking. We still talk about what we saw and wish we could have taken pictures. It was truly amazing. Well worth the visit.",
          "My initial reaction was 'oh no, another museum!' But then, seeing the talent of Croatian na\u00efve artists and learning about the technique of reverse painting on glass left me truly intrigued. It was a highlight of my visit -- other than the food and street theater!",
          "It's a quick run-through, but well worth it. Some colorful and captivating works you don't often get the chance to experience.",
          "This is the place. Though small, it has an impressive collection. Most importantly, staff is well versed on this important part of Croatian culture. Do not hesitate to ask questions and talk with them. As you enter the museum, you will receive a pamphlet. If you only read one",
          "Did not know much about the subject, even I have studied art history, now see this form of art in a different light. There is much more to it than at first sight. So came away much more enlightened. Really enjoyed it.",
          "OK, naive art can be pretty awful, but sometimes, it's brilliant, and this is one of the brilliant ones. You can see it all in about 20 minutes, and take it in thoroughly in 40, but I recommend one last dash through the six or so rooms to greet the favourites one last time, and",
          "This is an enjoyable small museum that has unique Croatian art. Some very beautiful. My wife and I really enjoyed our stop here. Highly recommended if you like to see historical/local art produced by Croatian farmers and artists without traditional training.",
          "I don't know if one needs to be an art aficionado to appreciate this museum, but it was worth the time. \"Na\u00efve\" is the wrong term for this museum--the art is not \"na\u00efve\" so much as it is art by \"unschooled,\" less-than art-educated painters. I found it fascinating--here was",
          "Well presented , but very stuffy atmosphere - not good for the people visiting & definitely not good for the paintings ,some of which were quite spectacular",
          "This museum has a nice collection of mainly croation naive artists, and is really worth a visit. It is not a big museum, and visiting does not take that much time.",
          "If you are not pressed for time, pop in, the work is bright and cheerful, the owner/curator handy to answer questions. It was a pleasant 10 minute visit",
          "We really enjoyed this small but interesting gallery. For UK visitors, some of the painting will remind you of some of the St Ives school most especially Alfred Wallis. The typical technique of painting in oils on glass gives an unusual quality to the pictures. The shop is full",
          "This is another unique museum in Zagreb as it features paintings from people who are not \"full-time\" artists. More from basically farmers who painted.",
          "This is the best gallery of naive art that I have ever seen, anywhere. While small, the quality is stunning. They have paintings on wood, canvas, and on glass. Particularly strong is the collection of Croatioan art, of course. The attached gallery shop sells excellent, and",
          "We went to the museum of naive art based on reviews and were a little disappointed. It was slightly more expensive and smaller than other places we visited and there was little variety in the exhibits. We were not really aware of the 'naive' painting style and wished we had",
          "Museum has 6 rooms full of naive art. It is well worth the visit if you are tired of other types of European art museums. You can see it all in about 1 hour. There is a good pamphlet in english to explain the movement and the artists. The curation could use a little help",
          "I knew little about this style of art before going to this museum. Went with my boyfriend (who is not interested in art) in May 2013 and we both had a really good time. The staff were friendly and the entrance fee was quite low and definitely worth the money. Some wonderful",
          "This is a great little museum & should not be missed. The admission price is right & it doesn't take long to visit, thereby not exhausting you as you explore the city. The technique employed by the artists was so clever & really makes the art vivid & unique.",
          "These are Croatian Artists and I feel that seeing the fine art of a country is interesting as there are not those \"big names\" but lesser known artists who are still worth your time. Check it out.",
          "We visited the Croatian Museum of Naive Art as my friend thought it would be interesting. I very much enjoyed some of the pictures, but not all of them. Art like this is also on sale in some of the shops around the city centre, so you can take a souvenir home with you.",
          "Compact exhibit of Croatian art -- done in reverse on glass -- canvas was too scarce and expensive. Don't hesitate to ask one of the \"docents\" about some of the symbolism --they'll take the time, and you'll walk away rewarded with a better understanding of the art and its",
          "Helpful and informative staff. If you have not really been exposed to this style of art, you will be surprised at how much skill is required to produce the paintings and drawings. The poster reproductions of many of the works are excellent value at only $5 a piece. A style that",
          "Really rich museum, nice to spend the afternoon. If you like art, this is the museum to see while visiting Zagreb.",
          "Be it a bit small, a really suburb collection of Naive art. You really would wish they had more space to exhibit lots more works. Surreal work of Christ's crucifixion by Kavocic and several paintings with a grotesque rooster by Vecenaj. One of my favourite museums in Zagreb.",
          "It's very small, and I actually only popped in to get out of the snow, but I loved this place. I'd never heard of Naive Art before, and I hadn't heard of any of the artists on display, but I'm now a convert. After traipsing through the thousands of dark, religious paintings",
          "If you like colors and naive art and have spare moment - just come in. A few rooms with many very interesting works of the local artists, some really interesting. Found also Nikifor's work (famous PL art naive representative).",
          "I had always thought that Naive Art was just a description of art by people who were not very good at it. This gallery has competely changed my view. I am now a convert. It really is worth a visit",
          "Museum has rather small number of paintings. Croatian naive art is fantastic, and real pleasure for the eye, tho this museum doesnt quite give the full picture of its value and selection. Collection is small and not giving you idea of how good naive art in this area really is.",
          "If possible, get a guide or docent to explain the exhibits. The technique of painting on glass is like nothing we've every seen. Just a few steps from the top of the funicular, this is a museum that can be enjoyed in about an hour and celebrates the unschooled creativity of",
          "This museum is located in the heart of Old Zagreb and should not be missed. While it is small, it's walls are teeming with local art of unusual imterpretation and perspective. One can spend hours perusing these paintings on glass.",
          "I enjoy looking at small collections of paintings, but this collection just amazed me, and to be honest, I could happily have spent many more hours there. After viewing some of the works, I remarked, in my ignorance, that the paintings looked like photographs. What I had not",
          "Beautiful, carefully curated collection of Croatian Naive art. Of any small gallery in the city, this would be my only must-see for visitors.",
          "There are just a few rooms, but each one is filled with treasures -- these paintings are amazing. This is one of the most interesting museums I have been to in a while.",
          "The visit to this museum wouldn't take more than 30 minutes maybe but the artworks in the museum are really extraordinary and interesting. Definitely advisable.",
          "Forget the prior review. This museum may not be as big as the Louvre but each piece of art is a gem. Many of the artists represented are now in galleries with high price tags and bought by collectors who have the ability to appreciate this work. The museum is currently closed",
          "the folk art is a true pleasure to see. the museum is small, the art easy to absorb, no overwhelm as you might experience in a large museum.",
          "This museum only has a few dozen paintings, I am not sure that is really represents a wide range of work. Not impressed with this museum.",
          "This small museum is well worth a visit to enjoy the unique naif art style depicting old country life, along with some more modern paintings in the naif style.",
          "The art is interesting just to see--and the museum is small enough that you could breeze in and out in an hour. However, it's much more interesting if you can get a member of the staff to give you details and backstory on some of the pieces. The Naive Art movement was more",
          "For the price (10 kn which is 50%off when you buy a Zagreb card) it is a deal. However, the display is not large and took me just under an hour to view. When I bought a few postcards, I asked the clerk about one of the paintings, and that I had not seen it on display. She said",
          "When we first saw this on our itinerary I thought it was a museum of NATIVE art that had been mispelled. Wrong! It is a remarkable museum of some 1500 pieces, many of which are oils on glass, except that the painting is applied backwards by the artist so when seen, it is \"under\"",
          "Interesting and different experience (not the usual tourist trap stop). Only 3-4 rooms, but well presented. Vladimir was our guide (arranged by our tour guide) and was excellent. Well worth the stop on the otherwise boring Zageb city tour.",
          "love to see their different styles of naive art, very good. Small museum, would be good for children, or others who dont have much time, good amount of paintings, books postcards. Interesting background on some of the painters.",
          "I didn't previously know about the Naive movement in Croatia, but totally fell in love with the work produced out of the movement. It's all kind of crazy and surrealist in an amazing way.",
          "This is a small gallery featuring paintings from classically untrained Croatian artists, the naive art movement. I learned about this museum from a Rick Steves episode and it was on the top of our list of things to do in Zagreb. The paintings are simply stunning - some display",
          "This is a small museum (Upper Town) with great art! Croatias most famous artists. Few pieces - but we spent a couple of hours just watching them. Not as busy as some of the bigger museums in Europe - we loved it!",
          "This was an intriguing museum not only from the standpoint of the style of art and the glimpse into (mostly) the more rural aspects of peasant life in Croatia --- but also the method of painting. What was fascinating to me was the fact that because canvas was so hard to come",
          "A wonderful collection of insider art, figurative and painted on glass by self-taught artists. The curator who took us through was knowledgeable and able to relate this Croatian work to the full panoply of Western Art in the 20th century.",
          "Most people when they see Naive Art will recognise the style - this is a small museum but none the less great. The artwork selection is varied and the info leaflet is great to help you understand more about the art and the artists as you go round.",
          "Cute museum with fascinating drawings.some more information on the artists or the techniques had been interesting.",
          "This is a must for lovers of genuine naive art and Croatian naive art in particular. Not big but housing a representative selection of interesting works. Well worth the visit - and worth revisiting as I did recently!",
          "We wandered by the Museum of Naive Art and remembered it from an episode of Rick Steves' Europe (a travel show on public broadcast tv in the US) so we decided to go in. We had never seen this type of art before and were really impressed. It only takes about 30 minutes to walk",
          "Fascinating when you realise that these pictures came form a small area of Croatia - and that this collection globe trotted in the 70s",
          "This is really more of a gallery than a museum. There are several rooms but the number of pieces is limited. It's a nice space and in the upper town, close to Jelacic Square.",
          "Well, at first we read this as native art only to learn naive art is an art form. The museum is on the small side, almost like a boutique store. The exhibits were mostly paintings. Brochures were available in several languages. We were outnumbered by staff while visiting and",
          "One of the best museum/art gallery that I have every visited. Although small, the artwork was stunning and memorable.",
          "There were about 80 painting on view. It is a super little gallery. The staff were informative. Very different art to that we usually view. A nice little souvenir/gift shop and very reasonably priced.",
          "I really enjoyed the paintings. It is small, but worth the visit.",
          "I have been collecting peasant painting from China, a visit to this little gallery gave me the pleasant surprise and I brought home some colorful prints. The little cable car ride uphill is a must as well.",
          "After watching a Rick Steves video, my wife and I decided to give this museum a try. I am not an art lover, but I must say this little gallery was worth the time. Located in the upper/old town, it was only a few Kuna to get in. We love Zagreb, so finding the little museums",
          "A small gallery, very reasonable, the information is thorough thought the art was brilliant. |Really enjoyed this, they have some very reasonably priced prints for sale in the shop too, much cheaper than if you buy them in the souvenir 'galleries'. Well worth a visit.",
          "My first experience seeing this type of art. Most people would find something to appreciate.",
          "This was the highlight of the Upper Town walk. Every piece in this museum is so interesting.",

        "wiki": "Gri\u010d Tunnel (Croatian: Tunel Gri\u010d) is a pedestrian tunnel located in the city centre of Zagreb, Croatia, under the historic neighbourhood of Gri\u010d (also called Gradec or Gornji Grad), which gave the tunnel its name. The tunnel consists of a central hall, which is connected by two passageways to Mesni\u010dka Street in the west and Stjepan Radi\u0107 Street in the east, and four passageways extending to the south. It was built during World War II by the Usta\u0161e government to serve both as a bomb shelter and a promenade, but following the war it quickly fell into disrepair and disuse. The tunnel saw renewed use only in the 1990s, hosting one of the first raves in Croatia, and functioning as a shelter during the Croatian War of Independence. In 2016, the tunnel was remodeled and opened to the public, serving as a tourist attraction and hosting cultural events. Planned expansions include a museum and a lift.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe tunnel spans 350 metres (1,150 ft) from Mesni\u010dka Street to Stjepan Radi\u0107 Street, and measures 3.2 metres (10 ft) in width. The central hall measures around 100 metres (330 ft) in length and 5.5 metres (18 ft) in width. The tunnel has six exits \u2013 the western one in Mesni\u010dka Street, the eastern in a yard at Radi\u0107 Street 19, and four branches extending southwards to back yards in Ilica Street and Tomi\u0107 Street. One of these exits leads to Tomi\u0107 Street 5a (Art Park), one to Ilica 8, and the two between them are unfinished as of December 2016, leading to Ilica 28 and 30. The tunnel's floor surface encompasses around 2,200 square metres (24,000 sq ft).The tunnel is open for public access every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Two sets of public toilets, remodeled in 2016, are placed near two of the tunnel exits. Parts of the original signage remain, but they were not fully restored in the 2016 remodeling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nIn 1943, due to fear of Allied bombing, the prime minister of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Nikola Mandi\u0107, ordered the creation of a public bomb shelter under the hill of Gornji Grad. The said shelter was to be connected to an east-west corridor spanning the entirety of the hill. A sum of 141.2 million NDH kuna was allocated for planning and construction of the tunnel. The project was assigned to engineers Abramovi\u0107, Senjakovi\u0107 and Vajda. The plan was to construct the tunnel in 90 working days, but the cost rose to 490 million kuna (partly due to high wartime inflation) and the date of opening was delayed into 1944.The project soon came under criticism. In February 1944, the Construction Committee of Zagreb, which was responsible for urban planning, issued a statement saying that the \"creation of a shelter as a transport link is completely inappropriate,\" and that \"too much attention has been devoted to it.\" Another argument was that in its function as a shelter, the tunnel only had a capacity of 5,000 people. At the time of the statement, the costs amounted to 60,000 kuna per person, which was deemed too expensive by the committee. Nevertheless, the construction continued, albeit parts of the project were scrapped. In May, the mayor of Zagreb, Ivan Werner, rejected the plans for a large central underground hall; instead, only the east-west corridor was built. The tunnel was built mostly using locally-sourced materials, including gravel from Zagreb area and wood from Bosnia.Following the end of World War II, the tunnel was renovated in 1947. Additional work was performed to secure the structure against water damage. In 1949, the tunnel was used as a warehouse by Malina, a food production company. A document dating to 31 October 1949 proposed the construction of another corridor connecting the existing one to the area of Gup\u010deva Zvijezda, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the north. There is no evidence that this corridor was ever constructed. However, the NDH plan's central hall, measuring almost 100 metres (330 ft) in length, was built sometime after. Emil Mate\u0161i\u0107, the director of the Cultural Informative Centre of Zagreb (Croatian: Kulturno informativni centar), believed that its construction was driven by the Cold War tensions and carried out in secret with some documents concerning the tunnel not having been released by the Croatian Ministry of Defence as of July 2016.\n\n\n=== Fall into obscurity ===\n\nFrom the mid-20th century, the tunnel fell into disuse. It became popular with homeless people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for warmth and shelter from elements, as well as a hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gup\u010deva Zvijezda.Gri\u010d Tunnel was not mentioned again in media until 1993, when it served as the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991\u201395), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter. During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radi\u0107 Street exit.\n\n\n=== Renovation ===\n\nIn the early 21st century, there were several proposals to remodel the tunnel. Proposals included a \"museum of senses\", and a lift to allow people to reach Gornji Grad from the Tu\u0161kanac parking garage without climbing the steep hill on foot. Both proposals were shelved.A renovation plan was finally announced in April 2015. The work began on 18 April 2016. It was to be done in three phases: the first phase was the renovation of the tunnel, the second phase the addition of a lift to Gornji Grad surface, and the third phase adding cultural facilities to attract tourists. A sum of 1,350,000 kuna (\u20ac180,000) was allocated for the first phase. The renovation phase was completed on 6 July and the Gri\u010d Tunnel was officially opened to the public. Only the Mesni\u010dka Street entrance, Art Park exit and Tomi\u0107 Street exit were opened at the time; Radi\u0107 Street and Ilica 28 and 30 entrances remained closed. The execution of the renovation was criticised for not following safety precautions; the tunnel was said to be damp and to lack smoke detectors, fire doors, sprinklers, or a mechanical ventilation system, and the fire escape route was problematic because two exits were narrowed to allow space for toilets.\n\n\n== Cultural content ==\nThe Museum of Senses (Croatian: Muzej osjeta) is a planned museum in the Gri\u010d Tunnel. The project will use display screens, video projectors and holograms to exhibit the history of Zagreb, while the central hall would be used for temporary exhibitions, concerts and other events. Additionally, two glass lifts are planned to connect the central hall with the Vranyczany Meadow overhead. Both ideas were considered by the city government as of 2005, but were eventually shelved for more than a decade.The 2016 opening of the tunnel was followed by several performances, including fashion shows and an Advent celebration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Gri\u010d Tunnel, Zagreb at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Literally just a tunnel, which is a cut through for the locals. Maybe if there was a display or exhibition then it might be worth it.",
          "We visited the tunnels in December, which saw it being decorated in a festive manner with Christmas music that added much character to the tunnel, but I still found it to be quite an interesting place considering its purpose and its architecture that is built into the hill. It's",
          "The reverence of the folks that pass and pray is addictive and moving. the decorations are beautiful and well preserved.",
          "What a clever way to use an old bomb shelter. You can only walk one way through it so be sure you start at the correct end. During the Christmas season, it is decked out like a Christmas Wonderland. It was fun to walk through and see the happy faces of children.",
          "Part of a city tour but you can do it alone as long as you find the correct of 4 entrances and the times it is available. Interesting part of the cities history and much bigger than we expected. They had decorated the central area with the Nutcracker Suite theme. We worth the",
          "It took us about 45 minutes to find the correct entrance and about 5 minutes to walk through it. It is one way so you need to find the correct entrance. It is however a free activity to do. It had about 50m of Christmas decorations in the middle which was really nice and I\u2019d",
          "I mean...I think all cities that have leftover WWII \ud83d\udca3 shelters should turn them into winter wonderlands, no?!? Still, what do they do the rest of the year? Put in fake palm trees\ud83c\udf34 and flamingos\ud83e\udda9?",
          "We were staying in a AirBnB on the hill in the old town. The temperatures were in the 90F range so a walk to the central market, although not far, meant ruining a good shower. Turns out that this tunnel, built as a bomb shelter (there are bathrooms on one of the entrances),",
          "Be aware that some entrances\\exits are blocked. We entered the tunnel on mesnicka street and got out on Radiceva street.",

          "Literally and figuratively a cool place to check out. Literally because it was 90F and going in there was like walking into a fridge. Figuratively the bomb shelter history was really neat.",
          "Friends took me through in order to get to the parking where they had their car parked. I was surprised with the vastness of the tunnels, as well as with the different surprises behind corners - art groups, people milling around.",
          "Well, I love tunnels, and this WWII relic was lovely. It took a while to find the entrance and then we walked from one end to the other. The tunnel is devoid of any information board. There were Christmas and New Year decorations inside the tunnel in January.",

          "I used the tunnel as a means of getting from the Lower to the Upper town. They were easy to find, and are only 10 minutes walk from Ban Jelacic Square. They are free to travel through. I wanted to travel them because they were built during World War II as a a bomb shelter and",
          "It was one of the things we were looking forward to seeing. A place where people hid, when there were bombing alerts, the place where the young people made a rave party in opposition of the war... and the place which people are now using, so as not to climb the hill :) Really",
          "This neat little tunnel was right next to our Hostel (chillout). It take you to the parks or the alley ways of some great streets for food, shopping and activities. It's a nice escape from the sun and it gets you to places a lot quicker if you know where you are going. Also,",
          "It is hard to comment on a pedestrian tunnel. If you are in the area check it out. It is quite long and a popular thoroughfare for the locals.",
          "we didnt see all the art work when we recently went but it was cool to walk through. even has toilets - which is strange as it doesnt take that long to walk through. worth doing though.",
          "Surprisingly long tunnel to traverse town. Feels like a cold war bomb shelter. Creepy feel but entirely safe.",
          "It's a tunnel how can anyone describe this as being interesting is beyond me but I am sure that someone can see the beauty but it escaped me possibly that's what tunnels are used for?",
          "Tunnels in old places are always mysterious and exciting. This tunnel was built during the World War ll and served as a bomb shelter and also as a pedestrian pathway under the area called Gric or Gornji grad. It was meant to be a short cut. It was out of use after the war.",
          "Cool Tunnel lead us into the street with all the bars and Cafes. Just plug your ears from the shameless screaming girls.",
          "I see photos of this tunnel with art and lights, but when we visited it was just a gray tunnel. It was much cooler inside than the scorched weather in Zagreb, so we enjoyed the short stroll for that reason. Free.",
          "These tunnels allow modern day Croatians to move freely underneath the city without climbing up the hill. You can enter or exit to all four points of the compass. Built during WW2 to protect citizens from bombing raids the tunnels have an eerie feel and a slightly damp",
          "Pretty much hidden off the main tracks, this tunnel was dug so that the Croat Government could his during WW2 in case of invasion. not much information inside or at the entrances about it, but walking from west to east sees you discreetly enter into the hubub of the city centre.",
          "These tunnels were built in the Cold war, and used as refuges during the Homelands War in 1991-4. They are cool and damp, and I don't fancy spending a night in them, but they were great in the heat this summer. Not a lot to see but interestingly used all the time by locals as an",
          "There seem to be several stories doing the rounds about the background to this tunnel Our guide told us it was built as a shelter from the WWII air raids. It connects Mesni\u010dka and Radi\u0107eva streets. ",
          "An interesting experience - walk underneath a city, through a hill. A rather long tunnel, with several exits to different parts of the city. Cool idea, enjoyable walk. But rather boring inside.",
          "I don't know why this tunnel complex exists. Seems kinda unnecessary... lol. The hill is not THAT big to walk around or over. But it is pretty cool -- both to see/walk and temperature wise in the summer. There are 5-6 different entry/exit points, all near the central,",

          "We walked through the Tunnel once in July, but there wasn't a whole lot to see...just basically a tunnel. There is some historical significance to it, but it isn't really explained and without that...it is just basically a tunnel. I wouldn't go out of my way to see this unless",
          "Pretty cool and also a good short cut to get around town. Brings you out in some great places, in particular the art garden.",
          "I stumbled upon this tunnel quite by chance when walking towards the Museum of Broken Relationships. It provides a nice respite from the 30C plus heat of Zagreb. However, the entrances are not so easy to find. One is behind some gates off the Radi\u0107eva and you could easily miss",

          "the actuall entrances to the tunel are not very easy to find, they really are just doors in the wall for the most part or take the signpost at the bottom of the finicular, down the passage till you see the Graffiti Entrance in my pictures. Dont do it alone as i did as it can be",

It is positioned perfectly to make a pleasant walk from the Jela\u010di\u0107 square, through the tunnel, up onto Strossmayer Promenade and Lotr\u0161\u0107ak Tower. The only challenge is to find the actual",

          "There are several entrances and exits for Tunel Gric. I tried to use GPS to find it. It took me several wrong turns to find one of the entrances. The entrance that I eventually found was just an inconspicious door way along the street! If you blink, you would miss it! It was",
          "There\u2019s not much to see here. It\u2019s a tunnel with history, but unless you have a guide to tell you some stories then it\u2019s just a tunnel. But at least it\u2019s free and it\u2019s cooler inside than on the street. The art park between two of the exits is worth a look",
          "When we walked the tunnel only a single exhibit was being set up so it was just a nice longish walk in the constant temperature of the tunnel. There is no cost for walking the length of the tunnel so what the heck. Nice historical perspective, too. Recommended",
          "The tunnel is a nice walk to old town. There was an exhibition of artwork from local school students which decorated the whole tunnel. It only takes a few minutes to walk through the tunnel, but worth the visit.",
          "Came across this by chance and despite our fears of claustrophobia we took the tunnel as a shortcut back to the old town - well preserved air raid shelter and the acoustics in the middle of the tunnel were interesting!",
          "We went walking through the area after our guide left and decided to wander into the old WWII tunnels. When there's nothing scheduled in the tunnel, it's just a cool tunnel from the heat of the day. It's been renovated and is a nice pedestrian walkway",
          "This is definitely a place to check out while in Zagreb. It's a tunnel, but still interesting given the history. It only take a few minutes to walk through, but it's worth it.",
          "You can read about the history of this converted bomb shelter on Wikipedia. We were there during Zagreb\u2019s Festival of Lights andre there was a lovely installation inside the tunnel.",
          "Tunnel was built in Second World War for shelter. Nowadays opened for public. As a part of advent happenings used for exhibition. Nothing special but interesting",

          "A very interesting tunnel that was built during World War 2 as a bomb shelter for the Croatians. The tunnel connects Mesni\u010dka and Radi\u0107eva Street in Zagreb. We were there during the Advent season and the tunnel was beautifully decorated with Christmas lightings and decorations.",
          "Tunel Gric can be great, but in same time disappointing. There are a lot of events happening there during the year, but they never live up to my expectations.",
          "Even though the tunnel wasn't decorated when I visited, it was still a nice walk from Gri\u010d to the city center. The tunnel has multiple exits and entrances, and even a (well equiped) toilet inside! Suitable for children and dogs, although it's not allowed to ride a bike inside.",
          "Unfortunately when I visited there were no exhibits but it was still a very neat thing to see since its one of Zagreb's claims to fame.",
          "Tunnel was built during World War II, and now it is open as underground passage which connects Mesni\u010dka and Radi\u0107eva street. Very strange and unique place.",

          "This tunel connects Mesni\u010dka and Radi\u0107eva Street, it's kind of shortcut but under ground. It was open to the public in July 2016.",
          "Many times in Zagreb but first time I see this tunel. It is very old but first time opened not long time ago and I was trying to visit tunel for 3 times. It was closed for Christmas and a day after has no luck to see it but third time we find tunel open. Thank's God. It was nice",
          "The Gri\u010d tunnel was originally made as a wartime shelter for the inhabitants of the city centre. In the 1990s it was used both as a shelter and as a venue for techno parties. Today, it is open for visitors and its interior changes with seasons and/or events. There are several",
          "We visited for New Year and the whole town is beautifully decorated including this tunnel the regular displays are covered and replaced by Christmas ones.",
          "Nice tunel to visit if you're near the old town. I believe that it is decorated accordingly to the season. In december you can see pine trees and other Christmas stuff.",
          "Very easy to find it... I was there yesterday during advent. I think this tunnel has 3 or 4 entrances. You can feel history when you walk through this place. Interesting!",
          "Although this tunnel was first introduced to public only a few years ago, it dates way back. It was actually used during the Croatian War of Independence, as a public shelter during the bombings. It's, in a way, hidden. All of its entrances (exept for the one on Mesni\u010dka",
          "Very unusual attraction and we made it for a special occasion, as they decorated it for Christmas. There was a music as well, nice and acoustic.",
          "It's quite nice tunnel and some Croatia based theme. Long tunnel upto 1.5 km so it's one time watch. From there you can cover the different spots to watch. You can try the cable car but it's just for few seconds which doesn't worth. Happy Travelling!!",
          "Being one of the attractions during the Zagreb advent Christmas Festival, we were looking forward to visiting the tunnel. We funiculared (is that even a verb?) to the upper town. We were super keen to see the Christmas-ified version of the Gric Tunnel and were not",
          "We came across the tunnels as the funicular was not running. What a lovely display for Advent based on Christmas books including a Christmas carol. Really lovely display. Well worth a visit.",
          "This tunnel is worth a visit, especially when there are some thematic contents in it, connecting the west and south of the city center",
          "Our tour guide in Zagreb recommended visiting the Tunel Gric and we're so glad she did. I'm not certain we would have discovered this gem of a museum without her recommendation. This former tunnel takes you through the complicated history of Croatia and is inviting, charming",
          "When I visited there was an exhibition about the history of Croatia. I found it very interesting. The only thing that I found annoying was...Tesla's Musical Spiral because there was a large group of teenagers that were setting it off! Go and see what I'm talking about! I",
          "excellent venue. great exhibition!!!! the exhibition was a retrospective of Zagreb and we had a lot of fun inside. I heard that during Advent, the tunel is also the venue, so I will go back.",
          "This is truly unique experience. We entered the tunnel from Mesnicka Ul. street. During our visit the long tunnel was a travel to the history of Croatia. Very interesting. In addition the integrated interactive art components. For example ... at a certain point in the tunnel,",
          "The current free exhibition in this old WW 2 bunker, the history of Croatia is an excellent interactive display. It is of a high standard and well worth the visit but I believe it finishes soon.",
          "No regrets to visit this old WW II tunnel. They had an expositie about the history of Croatia till now. Very informatieve and they create a rain-shower in the tunnel to wash the bad times away. Very impressive.",
          "This place is nice during Christmas time,nice decoration, nice place to go thru it but nothing special. If one is close is ok to visit...",
          "Had a tough time find the entrance but worked at it. There was a info art show about Croatian history in the tunnel and it was very informative. Tunnel was surprisingly long and the History was amazing. The even had an art instilation set up in the middle so that it Rained",
          "Really pleased that we took the time to visit this exhibition. It's located in an old tunnel in the historic centre of Zagreb which was once a bomb shelter. The exhibition when we visited was centred around the history of Croatia and was very interesting, with a few interactive",
          "Make sure you allow yourself an hour or more for this exhibit. It gives you the history of Croatia and has some interesting displays! Very well done! So glad I had the opportunity to visit this and it was free! No tour guide necessary/required and it is safe place to visit.",
          "This tunnel originally was intended as an air raid shelter in WW2. The tunnel itself is barren, grey and dull. There is a temporary exhibition about 125 years of Croatian history (till November 2017). As a result you can only enter the tunnel at its western end, the other",
          "We visited in early October and there was a free art exhibition going on in there (it really is a tunnel) about the history of Croatia showcasing the highlights and some of Croatia's colorful characters. This was an interesting event not to be missed.",
          "Its hard to find this place but its definetly a gem in Zagreb that you should find, especially on hot summer day when temperature and shadow are most human in the city.",
          "I though that this was a really great way to present the history of Croatia and I did think that the section where it rained had been brilliantly thought out - right down to the umbrellas.",
          "Nothing much to see inside the tunnel (empty tunnel) except when there's an exhibition in there, but still a nice refreshing walk during hot summer days, and great shortcut for getting around in Zagreb! I'm glad it's opened to public!",
          "Theme was the History of Croatia. Everything was sorted in years and short,informative sentences were provided under the photos. Great experience and lovely idea",
          "Lucky enough to visit when there was an exhibit. Was like a timeline of Croatian/Zagreb history. Excellent! And it was free. We enjoyed.",
          "the tunnel is closed until september 22. The area near the door is pretty particular. Really sad we've missed it.. but happy we saw the entrance.",
          "The tunnels have a great atmosphere and history. I am a bit of a party girl myself and when I found out that the tunnels were previously home to illegal raves etc I could picture huge lighting systems and techno/house music pumping through the walls\u2026 it would have been a great",
          "Very cold and windy tunnel, not much to see but its a fun way to travel around the city if you're avoiding the sun light.",

          "LIterally and figuratively cool. During the heat wave of August 2017, we just happened to come upon this network of tunnels. A quick way to avoid the hoards of people above. A way to cool off and get out of the sun. The entrance we used had a water fountain and bathrooms.",

          "I haven't seen the part with the blue light and paper flowers like the main picture here. Where I entered, it was just a concrete tunnel looking quite empty. However, I think there was a photo exhbition and also music was being played. It is good to take a short cut or to cool",
          "Quite interesting to wander through the tunnels, which are all interlinked under the city. Won't take long, less than half an hour, and there's not much to see, but it's a quirky thing to do and a good chance to cool down in hot weather. One of the entrances is in the Art Park,",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Tomislav (pronounced [t\u01d2misla\u028b], Latin: Tamisclaus) was the first King of Croatia. He became Duke of Croatia in c. 910, was elevated to kingship by 925 and reigned until 928. At the time of his rule, Croatia forged an alliance with the Byzantines during their struggle with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom Croatia eventually went to war that culminated in the decisive Battle of the Bosnian Highlands in 926. To the north there were often conflicts with the Principality of Hungary. Croatia kept its borders and to some extent expanded on the disintegrated Pannonian Duchy.\nTomislav attended the Church Council of Split in 925, convened by Pope John X to discuss the use of Slavic language in liturgy and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Croatia and the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia. Although the Pope sought to prohibit Slavic liturgy, the Council did not agree, while jurisdiction was given to the Archbishop of Split instead of the Croatian Bishop Gregory of Nin. Since the historical sources about Tomislav are scarce, the exact year of his accession and his death are not known. The rule of his successors was marked by a series of civil wars in Croatia and gradual weakening of the country.\n\n\n== Reign ==\n\n\n=== Early Duke of Croatia ===\n\nTomislav's ancestry is not known, but he maybe hailed from the House of Trpimirovi\u0107. There is a time difference of almost twenty years between the first attestation of Tomislav's name and the last mention of Muncimir, his predecessor as the Duke of Croatia. The historical records of him are scarce, but it is assumed that he was the son of Muncimir. Tomislav succeeded Muncimir, son of Trpimir I, on the throne of the Duchy of Croatia, either directly in about 910, which is the most widely accepted view, or after the rule of different figures following Muncimir's death. In any case, Tomislav gained the throne of Croatia at some time between 910 and 914. In Historia Salonitana (\"History of Salona\"), a chronicle from the 13th century written by Thomas the Archdeacon from Split, Tomislav was mentioned as the Duke of Croatia in 914.Following the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th and early 10th century, the Hungarians immediately began raiding and expanding their territory. They particularly threatened the Duchy of Pannonia, that was still nominally under Frankish suzerainty, and killed the last Pannonian Duke Braslav. The Hungarians also fought against Croatia, although it wasn't a primary target of their raids.The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja mentions that Tomislav, whose rule was specified at 13 years, successfully fought many battles with the Hungarians. Since the Venetian chronicler Andrea Dandolo and a notary of King B\u00e9la III mention Hungarian victories against Croatia in the same period, both sides had occasional gains. Croatia did manage to maintain its northern borders, but also to expand on a part of the collapsed Pannonian Duchy, such as its former capital Sisak. The plains north of Sisak were difficult to defend in front of the Hungarian cavalry, while Sisak was well fortified since the times of Duke Ljudevit. The sparsely populated area between the Sava and Drava rivers was on the outskirts of the Hungarian state, as well as of the Duchy of Croatia that was centered on the coastal areas, so neither country had the power to strengthen its rule there after the dissolution of the Duchy of Pannonia.East of Croatia, the power of the First Bulgarian Empire increased significantly. After a war between the Bulgarian Knyaz Boris I and Croatian Duke Trpimir I, the Croatian-Bulgarian relations were fairly good. Papal legates regularly went through Croatian territory, where they received protection, to Bulgaria. The situation changed in the 10th century during the reign of Simeon I, who decided to subordinate the Byzantine Empire to his rule.Tomislav's realm covered most of Southern and Central Croatia, the Dalmatian coast excluding the Theme of Dalmatia, parts of western present-day Herzegovina and northern and western present-day Bosnia. In the early 10th century Croatia was divided into 11 counties: Livno, Cetina, Imotski, Pliva, Pset, Primorje, Bribir, Nona, Knin, Sidraga, and Nin. 3 counties, Lika, Krbava, and Gacka, where under the rule of a ban (viceroy of the king). Presumably within Tomislav's state, after its expansion, there were more than eleven counties. Byzantine emperor and chronicler Constantine VII states in De Administrando Imperio that at its peak Croatia could have raised a vast military force composed out of 100,000 infantrymen, 60,000 horsemen and a sizable fleet of 80 large ships and 100 smaller vessels. However, these figures are viewed as a considerable exaggeration and an overemphasis of the Croatian army.\n\n\n=== Coronation and Croatian Kingdom ===\n\nTomislav became King of Croatia by the year 925. He was the first Croatian ruler whom the Papal chancellery honoured with the title \"king\". It is generally said that Tomislav was crowned in 924 or 925, however, this is not certain. It is not known when, where, or by whom he was crowned. The letters in which Tomislav was called a king were preserved in a version of Thomas the Archdeacon's History of Salona. In a note preceding the text of the Council conclusions in Split in 925 it is written that Tomislav is the king \"in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions\" (in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege). In the 12th canon of the Council conclusions in 925 the ruler of the Croats is called \"king\" (rex et proceres Chroatorum), while in a letter sent by the Pope John X Tomislav is named \"King of the Croats\" (Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum). Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves \"kings\".In older historiography it was assumed that Tomislav was crowned at the field of Duvno near Tomislavgrad (named \"Tomislav's City\" in his honour), although there are no contemporary records of this event. Such a conclusion was derived from the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja where a coronation of an alleged King \"Svatopluk\" (in a later version of the chronicle he was named \"Budimir\") and a council held on the field of Dalma were described. Some historians in the 19th century considered that Tomislav and Svatopluk were in fact the same person, or that the author mistakenly wrote the wrong name of the King. Other theories suggest that the Pope or one of his representatives had Tomislav crowned before the Church Council of Split in 925, or that Tomislav crowned himself.\n\n\n=== Church Councils of Split ===\n\nIn 925 Pope John X summoned a Church Council in Split. It was to be decided which of the bishops in the former Roman province of Dalmatia will gain ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The jurisdiction was contested between Gregory, the Croatian bishop of Nin, and John, the archbishop of Split. Prior to the council Bishop Gregory was responsible for a significantly larger territory than Archbishop John, but his reputation and financial situation could not be measured with the Archbishopric of Split. Split also claimed its continuity with the ancient Archbishopric of Salona, so due to its tradition the council confirmed Split as the archiepiscopal see. The territory from the river Ra\u0161a in Istria to Kotor, including Nin, were subjected to Split. Furthermore, the use of the Slavic language and Glagolitic script in the ecclesiastical service has also been discussed. The Pope sought to condemn it, but the council did allow the use of Slavic for local priests and monks, but they were prevented from advancing to higher positions.Thomas the Archdeacon didn't mention the council in his History of Salona. Thomas claimed that Split had ecclesiastical rights over former Roman Dalmatia since the 7th century, contradicting the conclusions of the council that gave these rights to Split in 925. Thomas apparently ignored the council so it wouldn't undermine his claims.The council was attended by Tomislav, who was referred as a king in documents relating to it, and Michael of Zahumlje. According to some historians, Michael recognized Tomislav's rule, making Zachlumia a vassal of Croatia. Tomislav did not protest against the decision of the council. Bishop Gregory appealed to the Pope and a second council was convened in 928 to resolve the controversial issues and enforce the conclusions of the first one in 925. It was also held in Split. The supremacy of the metropolitan Archbishopric of Split was confirmed, and the Diocese of Nin was abolished.\n\n\n=== War with Bulgaria ===\nDuring Tomislav's rule the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires were in a war. In 924 the Bulgarians under Emperor Simeon I destroyed the Principality of Serbia, a Byzantine ally, forcing Serbian Prince Zaharija and a part of the Serbian population to flee to Croatia. Croatia, also an ally of the Byzantines, was now located between Bulgaria and the weakly defended Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia. Tomislav may have been given some form of control over the coastal cities of the Theme of Dalmatia or a share of collected taxes for his assistance to the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines granted Tomislav the honorary title of proconsul, but there is no evidence that the Byzantines recognized the loss of their rights in the Theme of Dalmatia to Tomislav.Since Croatia was harboring Bulgarian enemies and was allied to the Byzantine Empire, Simeon decided to attack Croatia and sent an army led by Duke Alogobotur, but Tomislav cut his advance into Croatian realm and entirely destroyed his army at the Croatian\u2013Bulgarian battle of 926 which probably took place in the eastern part of Bosnia. The Croatians under Tomislav won a great victory, decimating the entire Bulgarian force. After the death of Emperor Simeon in 927, Pope John X sent his legates with Bishop Madalbert to mediate between Croatia and Bulgaria, thus restoring peace.It is unknown how Tomislav's life ended, but he disappeared from the political scene after 928 and was succeeded by Trpimir II.\n\n\n=== Geographical extent ===\n\nThe geographical extent of Tomislav's kingdom is not fully known. The chronicler John the Deacon, whose chronicle is a primary source for the history of Slavic peoples in Dalmatia during the 9th and 10th century, wrote that in 912 a Venetian ambassador, returning from Bulgaria, passed through Croatian territory before reaching the land of Zahumlje under Duke Michael, which suggests that Tomislav's Croatia bordered Bulgaria, then under the rule of Simeon I. British writer Marcus Tanner suggested that it covered most of modern Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the coastline of Montenegro. However, Roger Lampe argued that the state did not go as far south as Dubrovnik and that Istria was not included. Many Croatian scholars argued that the kingdom covered the whole region south of the Drava river to the Drina and Neretva rivers north of Dubrovnik.\nNevertheless, Croatian historian Nada Klai\u0107 had disputed the eastward (i.e. Bosnian) extension of Tomislav's kingdom in her 1972 book.Josip Lu\u010di\u0107 and Franjo \u0160anjek's 1993 Hrvatski povijesni zemljovid (Croatian historical map) provided an extended depiction of Tomislav's kingdom. Lu\u010di\u0107 was a known historical geographer from the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb who authored numerous maps in Croatian history books. Ivo Goldstein in turn argued in his 1995 book Hrvatski rani srednji vijek that Tomislav made no crucial expansion deeper into inner Bosnia and that he incorporated only parts of Pannonia to the Kingdom of Croatia, not the whole area between Drava and Sava, which was according to him Terra nullius. Neven Budak is in full agreement with Goldstein regarding the status of the Drava-Sava area, arguing that the northern Croatian border most likely passed through the wider Sisak area. Dominant modern university history textbooks in Croatia such as Tomislav Raukar's Hrvatsko srednjovjekovlje (1997) consider that during Tomislav's rule his kingdom covered between 60% to 80% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina. Franjo \u0160anjek also edited a major work by sixteen authors on the medieval Croatian state, which is also used as a university textbook also includes such a view.John Van Antwerp Fine stated that Tomislav's northern border was the Drava River. South of it he held \"modern Croatia, Slavonia, northern and western Bosnia, and the territory along the Dalmatian coast from what is now Rijeka to at least the mouth of the Cetina River (excluding the scattered Byzantine towns)\". In his 2006 book, John Van Antwerp Fine criticized the relationship between Tomislav's territory and modern nationalist sentiment in Croatia saying that 10th-century sources are unreliable and \"roughly a third\" of Croatia's perceived eastern land is \"entirely speculation\". Fine stated, \"It is possible that Croatia really did have some of it, but Bulgaria may have had some of it; early Serb entities may have had some of it, not to speak of various \u017eupans and other local Slavic lords who in any serious way answered to no one. If the last supposition is true (to any degree), then parts of this territory would not have been held by any 'state.'\" While acknowledging the possibility of Croatia having held all the depicted territory and more, Fine stated that whoever controlled the eastern land depicted in Tomislav's kingdom is unknown and should be marked as terra incognita in maps. He criticised Lu\u010di\u0107 and \u0160anjek's delineation of Tomislav's eastern border as \"nationalist map-making\" and distorting the perceptions of children on their nation's history in a way that promotes interpreting later events as territorial loss and fragmentation.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nTomislav is celebrated as the first Croatian king and the founder of the first united Croatian state. In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, there is a square dedicated to Tomislav, named after him in November 1927. A monument in Zagreb by sculptor Robert Frange\u0161 Mihanovi\u0107 was raised in his honor. The Bosnian city of Duvno was renamed Tomislavgrad (literally:Tomislavcity or Tomislavtown) in 1925 on the occasion of the 1,000th anniversary of his coronation by King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Celebrations of the anniversary were held across the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1926 an obelisk in his honor was made in Livno.\nTomislav's statue in Zagreb is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 1000 kuna banknote, issued in 1994. He also lends his name to a 'dark beer' which is brewed in Croatia.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of Croatia\nCroatian\u2013Bulgarian wars\nGrand Order of King Tomislav\nList of rulers of Croatia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCroatia in the 10th and 11th centuries: maps from the book of Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107, a Croatian historian",

        "wiki": "The Zagreb rocket attacks were a series of two rocket attacks conducted by the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina that used multiple rocket launchers to strike the Croatian capital of Zagreb during the  Croatian War of Independence. The attack killed seven and wounded over 200 Croatian civilians and was carried out on 2 May and 3 May 1995 as retaliation for the Croatian army's offensive in Operation Flash. The rocket attacks deliberately targeted civilian locations. Zagreb was the largest of several cities hit by the attack. It was the only instance in the entire war in Croatia that cluster bombs were used in combat.The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) characterized the attack as a crime against humanity and convicted Croatian Serb leader Milan Marti\u0107 of ordering the attack.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nDuring the early part of the war, the Croatian capital Zagreb was spared from devastation, as it was far from the frontlines. Serb General Milan \u010celeketi\u0107 announced to the press on 24 March 1995, more than a month prior to the attack, that should a Croatian offensive be launched, he expected to respond by targeting the \"weak points,\" that is, \"the parks of the Croatian cities\" and added: \"We know who the people in the parks are; civilians.\"In May 1995 Croatia launched Operation Flash, which recaptured the area of western Slavonia (UNPA sector West) that had been under Serb control since 1991. In neighboring Bosnia, the leader of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, threatened to send help to the Serbs in Croatia. Following the rapid collapse of the Serb defence in the area, Serb leader Milan Marti\u0107 ordered Serb rocket artillery units in the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina to fire missiles on the capital of Zagreb. Karlovac and Sisak were also subjected to retaliatory attacks.\nThe Yugoslav-produced  Orkan 262 mm Multiple rocket launchers (MRL) fires M-87 non-guided missiles. The ones fired against Zagreb were armed with aviation cluster bomb warheads (called cassette bombs or Jinglebell), each of which contains 288 \"bomblets\" (smaller ammunition) which are ejected at a height of 1,000 meters above the target area. Upon impact, each bomblet explodes and releases 420 pellets, the lethal range of each of which is ten meters. This means that each rocket releases around 120,000 of these pellets, which have been characterized as designed specifically to kill or maim local infantry.\n\n\n== Strikes ==\n\nOn 1 May, a meeting was held between leaders of the RSK. Although negotiations were on-going, Marti\u0107 and \u010celeketi\u0107 were not in favor of a peaceful solution. At 1 pm on 1 May, Milan \u010celeketi\u0107 ordered, with Marti\u0107 present, an artillery barrage on Sisak which was opened at 5 pm that day. On the same day, an M-87 Orkan rocket artillery unit from Knin was redeployed to Vojni\u0107 (about 50 km south of Zagreb).The first attack occurred on 2 May, at 10:25 in the morning. At the time, many civilians were in the streets. The targets hit included the Strossmayer promenade, Petrinjska street and Vla\u0161ka street where a tram full of passengers was hit. The Classical Gymnasium in Zagreb located in the city centre was also hit, as were Pleso and its airport. In total, five civilians were killed and 146 injured.The second attack occurred the following day, at 12:10 in the afternoon. The children's hospital in Klai\u0107eva street, the Croatian National Theatre building (which housed Russian, Ukrainian and British ballet dancers at the time, some of whom were wounded) and the Courthouse at Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski Square were among those hit.Two civilians were killed that day and 48 injured, which were less than the day before due to many people avoiding public areas following the first attack. Most of the missiles targeted the city center and surrounding streets, which were most likely to be filled with civilians in the morning. In total, seven people were killed and about 200 injured (of which about 100 seriously) from these attacks.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nOn 3 May, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, President of Serbia at the time, instructed Yugoslav Army Chief of the General Staff Mom\u010dilo Peri\u0161i\u0107 to call \u010celeketi\u0107 and forbid further strikes against Zagreb.After 4 May and the end of Operation Flash, United Nations Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi met with Marti\u0107 and condemned him for the attack. Marti\u0107 then threatened to resume the attacks and spoke of \"massive rocket attacks on Zagreb which would leave 100,000 people dead.\"On October 10, 2013, a cluster bomb which failed to detonate was discovered on the roof of the Klai\u0107eva children's hospital, 18 years after the attacks. After surgery on several patients had been completed, the Zagreb police bomb disposal squad was given clearance to detonate the ordnance. No one was injured in the detonation.In May 2013, city mayor Milan Bandi\u0107 opened a museum in Petri\u0107eva St. dedicated to the tragedy. \n\n\n== War crimes charges by the ICTY ==\nMilan Marti\u0107, President of the Republic of Serbian Krajina and Supreme Commander of the SVK, ordered the shelling of three Croatian cities: Zagreb, Sisak and Karlovac. On 2 May 1995, at approximately 10:25 hours, on the order of Milan Marti\u0107, General \u010celeketi\u0107 of the SVK ordered his subordinates to fire an Orkan Multiple Barrel Rocket Launcher fitted with \"cluster bomb\" warheads from the area of Petrova Gora into the central part of Zagreb and the airport (Pleso). These rockets impacted in several locations within the central commercial district of Zagreb, primarily the areas of Stara Vla\u0161ka Street, Josip Juraj Strossmayer Square and Krizaniceva Street. During this unlawful attack, at least five civilians were killed and at least 146 civilians wounded. On 3 May 1995, at approximately 12:10 hours on the orders of Milan Martic, the Orkan Multiple Barrel Rocket Launcher fitted with \"cluster bomb\" warheads was once again fired from the area of Petrova Gora into the centre of Zagreb. Rockets impacted in the areas of Klaiceva Street, Meduliceva Street, Ilica Street and near the Croatian National Theatre. This unlawful attack caused the deaths of two civilians and wounded forty-eight others.\nImmediately following the attacks, Marti\u0107 appeared on Serb television and publicly boasted about ordering the attacks. This video was later used against him during his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) after he was indicted for war crimes. The attack on Zagreb was one of the main points of the indictment against him, to which he confessed, but claimed it was a \"legitimate action against the enemy\". On June 12, 2007, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison.Peri\u0161i\u0107, was also indicted for his role in the rocket attack. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison because the judges ruled that he had effective control over the SVK commanders since he issued orders to them and initiated disciplinary proceedings against them; therefore he was responsible for the failure to punish those who launched the rockets on Zagreb. In February 2013, Peri\u0161i\u0107 was acquitted on all counts and released upon appealing his conviction.\nIn the mid-morning of the 2nd of May 1995, without warning, several Orkan rockets struck locations in Zagreb, including the main square, several shopping streets, a school, the village of Pleso near Zagreb airport and the airport itself. Five persons, all civilians, were killed in these attacks and at least 160 persons were severely injured. Many of these victims still today suffer from their injuries. At midday the following day, 3rd May 1995, Zagreb was again shelled by Orkan rockets. The areas hit were the Croatian National Theatre at present-day Republic of Croatia Square, a children\u2019s hospital, as well as another square. These attacks claimed two lives and injured 54 people. Many of these victims also still suffer from their injuries.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Martic Ordered Shelling Centre Of Zagreb, Says Protected Witness\". Journal of Turkish Weekly.

        "wiki": "Zagreb (; Croatian pronunciation: [z\u01ce\u02d0\u0261reb] (listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level. \nThe estimated population of the city in 2018 was 820,678. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,086,528, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's \u0160\u010ditarjevo. The name \"Zagreb\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf.\nZagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of them are at a low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.\nThe name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum. \nThe older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson.\nAn even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century).\nFor this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D\u00e9csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr\u0119b\u044a which means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatian br\u0207g < Proto-Slavic *berg\u044a, which also means '(smaller) hill', and za br\u0207g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag \u2013 modified from assumed *Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony? \u2013, mentioned above.) An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr\u0119b\u044a is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\"\nbut according to D\u00e9csy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram.\n\nIn Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as  Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri\u010d (Gradec)).\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb  za-grab-, meaning  \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation \nties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka\u017eoti\u0107 (c. 1260\u20131323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.\nIn another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water from Mandu\u0161evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\"Scoop, Manda!\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now \u0160\u0107itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in his honour. During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Zagreb ===\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara\u017edin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara\u017edin and Karlovac general command.\n\n\n=== 19th to mid-20th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first mayor \u2013 Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.\nThe first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\n\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri\u010d cannon is fired daily from the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east and \u010crnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta\u0161a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n=== Modern Zagreb ===\n\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb). \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb-zapad (West\nNovi Zagreb) and Novi Zagreb-istok (East Novi Zagreb)\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.During the 1991\u20131995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many.\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n=== Area and population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), but with significant continental influences and very closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris and London. Autumn in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those districts along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F).The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 \u00b0C (104.7 \u00b0F) in July 1950, and lowest was \u221227.3 \u00b0C (\u221217.1 \u00b0F) in February 1956. A temperature of \u221230.5 \u00b0C (\u221222.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\t\t\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep\u010danka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb \u2013 istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani\u0161te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4\u20138 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani\u0161te or Kajzerica.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n\nThe wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of \u0160\u0107itarjevo.\nPicturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, \u0160estine, Gra\u010dani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, \u0160estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products.\nTo the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament.\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\nThe old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of \u017dumberak-Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,325 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.1 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County. Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia.\nIn 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative centre of both.\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.\n\n\n==== City districts ====\n\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska \u010detvrt, pl. gradske \u010detvrti):\n\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.\n\n\n==== Settlements ====\n\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area \u2013 there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu\u010dko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately. There are 70 settlements in the City of Zagreb administrative area:\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandi\u0107 (BM 365 \u2013Labour and Solidarity Party). He was confirmed as mayor on 4 June 2017 (Zagreb local elections 2017, second round). Two deputy mayors (vice mayoresses) are Jelena Pavi\u010di\u0107-Vuki\u010devi\u0107 and Olivera Jurkovi\u0107-Maji\u0107.\nThe Zagreb Assembly is composed of 51 representatives. Last elections were held on 21 May 2017 (Zagreb local elections). The current structure of the city assembly by party lines is as follows (2 December 2017):\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia, has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county. It is also the seat of the Zagreb County which encircles Zagreb.\nThe city administration bodies are the Zagreb City Assembly (Gradska skup\u0161tina Grada Zagreba) as the representative body and the mayor of Zagreb  (Gradona\u010delnik Grada Zagreba) who is the executive head of the city.\nThe City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d'Hondt method in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them president and vice-presidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives.\nPrior to 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the Zagreb Assembly city deputies have the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. \u2153 of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).\nIn the City of Zagreb the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a \"city with county rights\", there isn't State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).\nCity administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration.\nThe city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly).\nLocal government is organised in 17 city districts (or city borroughs) represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ====\nZagreb is twinned with the following towns and cities:\n\n\n==== Partner cities ====\nThe city has partnership arrangements with:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nZagreb is an important tourist center, not only in terms of passengers traveling from the rest of Europe to the Adriatic Sea, but also as a travel destination itself. Since the end of the war, it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from Austria, Germany and Italy, and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the Republic of Croatia Square, the other at Kamenita vrata, where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire.

The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu\u010dko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.\nA3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa. It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe. Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori\u010dan border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Vara\u017edin \u2013 \u010cakovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes. The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu\u0161kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai\u0107 Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east\u2013west arteries, former Highway \"Brotherhood and Unity\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba\u010dka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.\n\n\n===== Bridges =====\nZagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are:\n\nThere are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi\u010devec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre\u0161i\u0107 (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east).\nTwo additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nPublic transportation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail.\nThe public transportation company ZET (Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\nThe national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice, H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.\nThe funicular (uspinja\u010da) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction.\nTaxi market has been liberalized in early 2018 and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n\n===== Tram network =====\n\nZagreb has an extensive tram network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30\u201350 kilometres per hour (19\u201331 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon\u010dar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T\u017dV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \"TMK 2200\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.\n\n\n===== Suburban rail network =====\n\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east\u2013west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor\u010dek was closed in the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Air traffic ====\n\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft. The airport had 2,77 millions of passengers in 2016 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers.\nZagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu\u010dko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu\u010dko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.A third, small grass airfield, Bu\u0161evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nZagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia.

          "After reading other reviews here, I decided to give this museum a try, and I'm so glad I did. I spent a full three hours there, so allow enough time. (Although it certain can be done faster.) Don't be discouraged in the beginning-there's very little English in the prehistory",
          "I wasn't that interested before I went in but since it was raining decided to give it a chance. Really, it was filled with so many interesting items and facts of history. I spent over an hour here perusing all the showcases and reading interesting facts about the city. Well",

          "I had a great time at this museum, and I learned a lot. I just wish I knew how big it actually was, and I would have paced myself better. Much of the information is in English, and there is a lot of interesting history of the city, tailing off at around 1991, but with impressive"

        "wiki": "The Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb (Croatian: Hrvatsko narodno kazali\u0161te u Zagrebu), commonly referred to as HNK Zagreb, is a theatre, opera and ballet house located in Zagreb.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe theatre evolved out of the first city theatre built in 1836 housed in the present-day Old City Hall. The theatre was first established as the Croatian National Theatre in 1860, and in 1861 it gained government support putting it on par with many other European national theatres. In 1870 an opera company was added to the theatre and in 1895 it moved to the new purpose-built building on Republic of Croatia Square in Zagreb's Lower Town, where it is based today.\nAustro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph I was at the unveiling of this new building during his visit to the city in 1895.\nThe building itself was the project of famed Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Herman Helmer, whose firm had built several theatres in Vienna. Celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the building were held on October 14, 1995.\nAt the entrance of the theatre is located the wall fountain The Source of Life (Zdenac \u017eivota), designed by Croatian artist and sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 in 1905.Many of Croatia's leading artist have worked at the theatre. Its first manager and dramatist was the Greek\u2013Croatian poet Dimitrija Demeter, a leading activist of the Croatian national revival movement, with Ivan Zajc as first conductor. Jakov Gotovac was the Theatre's opera conductor from 1923 to 1958. The famous Croatian theatre director Branko Gavella began his career here, as did the first Croatian prima ballerina Mia \u010corak Slavenska.\nThe theatre has also seen many international artists including Franz Liszt, Sarah Bernhardt, Franz Leh\u00e1r, Richard Strauss, G\u00e9rard Philipe, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Jean-Louis Barrault, Peter Brook, Mario Del Monaco, Jos\u00e9 Carreras.There are also Croatian National Theatres in Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Vara\u017edin and Zadar.Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic the Croatian National Theater in Zagreb decided, in collaboration with the daily newspaper 24sata, to allow citizens access quality cultural content through a YouTube channel, which will feature daily performances from the branches of opera, ballet and drama, and the viewers will be able to watch some of the most popular performances of the Theater, such as:\nOne Song a Day Takes Mischief Away - Video on YouTube\nSwan lake - Video on YouTube\nEro the Joker - Video on YouTube\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Zagreb\nHistory of Croatia\nCroatian Academy of Sciences and Arts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Croatian)",

        "wiki": "Zagreb (; Croatian pronunciation: [z\u01ce\u02d0\u0261reb] (listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level. \nThe estimated population of the city in 2018 was 820,678. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,086,528, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's \u0160\u010ditarjevo. The name \"Zagreb\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf.\nZagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of them are at a low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.\nThe name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum. \nThe older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson.\nAn even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century).\nFor this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D\u00e9csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr\u0119b\u044a which means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatian br\u0207g < Proto-Slavic *berg\u044a, which also means '(smaller) hill', and za br\u0207g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag \u2013 modified from assumed *Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony? \u2013, mentioned above.) An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr\u0119b\u044a is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\"\nbut according to D\u00e9csy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram.\n\nIn Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as  Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri\u010d (Gradec)).\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb  za-grab-, meaning  \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation \nties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka\u017eoti\u0107 (c. 1260\u20131323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.\nIn another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water from Mandu\u0161evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\"Scoop, Manda!\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now \u0160\u0107itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in his honour. During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Zagreb ===\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara\u017edin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara\u017edin and Karlovac general command.\n\n\n=== 19th to mid-20th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first mayor \u2013 Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.\nThe first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\n\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri\u010d cannon is fired daily from the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east and \u010crnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta\u0161a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n=== Modern Zagreb ===\n\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb). \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb-zapad (West\nNovi Zagreb) and Novi Zagreb-istok (East Novi Zagreb)\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.During the 1991\u20131995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many.\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n=== Area and population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), but with significant continental influences and very closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris and London. Autumn in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those districts along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F).The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 \u00b0C (104.7 \u00b0F) in July 1950, and lowest was \u221227.3 \u00b0C (\u221217.1 \u00b0F) in February 1956. A temperature of \u221230.5 \u00b0C (\u221222.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\t\t\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep\u010danka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb \u2013 istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani\u0161te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4\u20138 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani\u0161te or Kajzerica.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n\nThe wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of \u0160\u0107itarjevo.\nPicturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, \u0160estine, Gra\u010dani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, \u0160estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products.\nTo the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament.\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\nThe old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of \u017dumberak-Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,325 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.1 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County. Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia.\nIn 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative centre of both.\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.\n\n\n==== City districts ====\n\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska \u010detvrt, pl. gradske \u010detvrti):\n\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.\n\n\n==== Settlements ====\n\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area \u2013 there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu\u010dko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately.

The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu\u010dko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY.

The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu\u0161kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai\u0107 Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east\u2013west arteries, former Highway \"Brotherhood and Unity\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba\u010dka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day.

The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30\u201350 kilometres per hour (19\u201331 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon\u010dar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T\u017dV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \"TMK 2200\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.\n\n\n===== Suburban rail network =====\n\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east\u2013west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor\u010dek was closed in the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Air traffic ====\n\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica.

        "wiki": "Zagreb (; Croatian pronunciation: [z\u01ce\u02d0\u0261reb] (listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level. \nThe estimated population of the city in 2018 was 820,678. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,086,528, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's \u0160\u010ditarjevo. The name \"Zagreb\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf.\nZagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of them are at a low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.\nThe name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum. \nThe older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson.\nAn even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century).\nFor this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D\u00e9csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr\u0119b\u044a which means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatian br\u0207g < Proto-Slavic *berg\u044a, which also means '(smaller) hill', and za br\u0207g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag \u2013 modified from assumed *Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony? \u2013, mentioned above.) An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr\u0119b\u044a is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\"\nbut according to D\u00e9csy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram.\n\nIn Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as  Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri\u010d (Gradec)).\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb  za-grab-, meaning  \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation \nties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka\u017eoti\u0107 (c. 1260\u20131323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.\nIn another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water from Mandu\u0161evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\"Scoop, Manda!\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now \u0160\u0107itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in his honour. During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Zagreb ===\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\n\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara\u017edin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara\u017edin and Karlovac general command.\n\n\n=== 19th to mid-20th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first mayor \u2013 Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.\nThe first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\n\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri\u010d cannon is fired daily from the Lotr\u0161\u010dak Tower on Gri\u010d to mark midday.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east and \u010crnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta\u0161a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n=== Modern Zagreb ===\n\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb). \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb-zapad (West\nNovi Zagreb) and Novi Zagreb-istok (East Novi Zagreb)\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.During the 1991\u20131995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many.\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n=== Area and population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), but with significant continental influences and very closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris and London. Autumn in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those districts along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F).The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 \u00b0C (104.7 \u00b0F) in July 1950, and lowest was \u221227.3 \u00b0C (\u221217.1 \u00b0F) in February 1956. A temperature of \u221230.5 \u00b0C (\u221222.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\t\t\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep\u010danka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb \u2013 istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani\u0161te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4\u20138 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani\u0161te or Kajzerica.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n\nThe wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of \u0160\u0107itarjevo.\nPicturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, \u0160estine, Gra\u010dani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, \u0160estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products.\nTo the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagreba\u010dka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament.\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\nThe old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of \u017dumberak-Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,325 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.1 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County. Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia.\nIn 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative centre of both.\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.\n\n\n==== City districts ====\n\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska \u010detvrt, pl. gradske \u010detvrti):\n\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.\n\n\n==== Settlements ====\n\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area \u2013 there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu\u010dko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately. There are 70 settlements in the City of Zagreb administrative area:\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandi\u0107 (BM 365 \u2013Labour and Solidarity Party). He was confirmed as mayor on 4 June 2017 (Zagreb local elections 2017, second round). Two deputy mayors (vice mayoresses) are Jelena Pavi\u010di\u0107-Vuki\u010devi\u0107 and Olivera Jurkovi\u0107-Maji\u0107.\nThe Zagreb Assembly is composed of 51 representatives. Last elections were held on 21 May 2017 (Zagreb local elections). The current structure of the city assembly by party lines is as follows (2 December 2017):\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia, has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county. It is also the seat of the Zagreb County which encircles Zagreb.\nThe city administration bodies are the Zagreb City Assembly (Gradska skup\u0161tina Grada Zagreba) as the representative body and the mayor of Zagreb  (Gradona\u010delnik Grada Zagreba) who is the executive head of the city.\nThe City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d'Hondt method in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them president and vice-presidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives.\nPrior to 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the Zagreb Assembly city deputies have the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. \u2153 of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).\nIn the City of Zagreb the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a \"city with county rights\", there isn't State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).\nCity administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration.\nThe city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly).\nLocal government is organised in 17 city districts (or city borroughs) represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ====\nZagreb is twinned with the following towns and cities:\n\n\n==== Partner cities ====\nThe city has partnership arrangements with:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nZagreb is an important tourist center, not only in terms of passengers traveling from the rest of Europe to the Adriatic Sea, but also as a travel destination itself. Since the end of the war, it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from Austria, Germany and Italy, and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the Republic of Croatia Square, the other at Kamenita vrata, where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called Nine Views. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\nThe historical part of the city to the north of Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square is composed of the Gornji Grad and Kaptol, a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours. The historic district can be reached on foot, starting from Jela\u010di\u0107 Square, the centre of Zagreb, or by a funicular on nearby Tomi\u0107eva Street. Each Saturday, (from April till the end of September), on St. Mark's Square in the Upper town, tourists can meet members of the Order of The Silver Dragon (Red Srebrnog Zmaja), who reenact famous historical conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol. It's a great opportunity for all visitors to take photographs of authentic and fully functional historical replicas of medieval armour.\nIn 2010 more than 600,000 tourists visited the city, with a 10% increase seen in 2011. In 2012 a total of 675 707 tourists visited the city.\nThe record number of tourists visited Zagreb in 2017. \u2013 1.286.087, up 16% compared to the year before, which generated 2.263.758 overnight stays, up 14,8%.\n\n\n==== Souvenirs and gastronomy ====\n\nNumerous shops, boutiques, store houses and shopping centers offer a variety of quality clothing. There are about fourteen big shopping centers in Zagreb. Zagreb's offerings include crystal, china and ceramics, wicker or straw baskets, and top-quality Croatian wines and gastronomic products.\nNotable Zagreb souvenirs are the tie or cravat, an accessory named after Croats who wore characteristic scarves around their necks in the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century and the ball-point pen, a tool developed from the inventions by Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, an inventor and a citizen of Zagreb.\nMany Zagreb restaurants offer various specialties of national and international cuisine. Domestic products which deserve to be tasted include turkey, duck or goose with mlinci (a kind of pasta), \u0161trukli (cottage cheese strudel), sir i vrhnje (cottage cheese with cream), krem\u0161nite (custard slices in flaky pastry), and orehnja\u010da (traditional walnut roll).\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nZagreb's numerous museums reflect the history, art and culture not only of Zagreb and Croatia, but also of Europe and the world.

The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu\u010dko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.\nA3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa. It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe. Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori\u010dan border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Vara\u017edin \u2013 \u010cakovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes. The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu\u0161kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai\u0107 Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east\u2013west arteries, former Highway \"Brotherhood and Unity\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba\u010dka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.\n\n\n===== Bridges =====\nZagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are:\n\nThere are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi\u010devec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre\u0161i\u0107 (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east).\nTwo additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nPublic transportation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail.\nThe public transportation company ZET (Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\nThe national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice, H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.\nThe funicular (uspinja\u010da) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction.\nTaxi market has been liberalized in early 2018 and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n\n===== Tram network =====\n\nZagreb has an extensive tram network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30\u201350 kilometres per hour (19\u201331 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon\u010dar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T\u017dV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \"TMK 2200\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.\n\n\n===== Suburban rail network =====\n\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east\u2013west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor\u010dek was closed in the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Air traffic ====\n\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft. The airport had 2,77 millions of passengers in 2016 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers.\nZagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu\u010dko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu\u010dko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.A third, small grass airfield, Bu\u0161evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nZagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia. There are 5 public higher education institution and 9 private professional higher education schools.\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nFounded in 1669, the University of Zagreb is the oldest continuously operating university in Croatia and one of the largest and oldest universities in the Southeastern Europe. Ever since its foundation, the university has been continually growing and developing and now consists of 29 faculties, three art academies and the Croatian Studies Centre.

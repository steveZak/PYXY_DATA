        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 359,666 and a population density of 1,300 persons per km2. There were 160,242 households residing in Nara. The highest concentration of both households and population, respectively about 46,000 and 125,000, is found along the newer bedtown districts, along the Kintetsu line connecting to Osaka.\nThere were about 3,000 registered foreigners in the city, of which Koreans and Chinese are the two largest groups with about 1,200 and 800 people respectively.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== Buddhist temples ===\nT\u014ddai-ji, including Nigatsu-d\u014d and Sh\u014ds\u014din\nSaidai-ji\nK\u014dfuku-ji\nGang\u014d-ji\nYakushi-ji\nT\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji\nShin-Yakushi-ji\nAkishino-dera\nByakug\u014d-ji\nDaian-ji\nEnj\u014d-ji\nEnsh\u014d-ji\nFutai-ji\nHannya-ji\nHokke-ji\nKik\u014d-ji\nRy\u014dsen-ji\nSh\u014dryaku-ji\n\n\n=== Shinto shrines ===\n\nHimuro Shrine\nKasuga Shrine\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine\n\n\n=== Former imperial palace ===\nHeij\u014d Palace\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNara National Museum\nNara Municipal Buried Cultural Properties Research Centre\nNara City Historical Materials Preservation House\nNara Prefectural Museum of Art\nIrie Taikichi Memorial Museum of Photography Nara City\nNakano Museum of Art\nNeiraku Museum\nSh\u014dhaku Art Museum\nYamato Bunkakan\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nFormer Daij\u014d-in Gardens (\u65e7\u5927\u4e57\u9662\u5ead\u5712)\nIsuien Garden\nKy\u016bseki Teien\nManyo Botanical Garden, Nara\nYoshiki-en\nYagy\u016b Iris Garden, Nara (\u67f3\u751f\u82b1\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3076\u5712)\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNaramachi\nNara Park\nNara Hotel\nNara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties\nYagy\u016b\nZut\u014d (\u982d\u5854)\nNara Dreamland\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nNara Marathon\nNara Centennial Hall\nNara Kasugano International Forum Iraka\nShuni-eGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Deer in Nara ==\nAccording to the legendary history of Kasuga Shrine, the god Takemikazuchi arrived in Nara on a white deer to guard the newly built capital of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d. Since then, the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.Tame sika deer (also known as spotted deer or Japanese deer) roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. In 2015, there were more than 1,200 sika deer in Nara. Snack vendors sell sika senbei (deer crackers) to visitors so they can feed the deer. Some deer have learned to bow in order to receive senbei from people.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\nAs of 2005, there are 16 high schools and 6 universities located in the city of Nara.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nNara Women's University is one of only two national women's universities in Japan.

          "Deers are everywhere, from the streets to temples and grass landscapes. Droppings are also everywhere, but the locals are sweeping it up when they see it. Dont get too concern with stepping on them. Apparently i went during the mating season; where they may be more",
          "It is an awesome experience, not only for my boys, but also for the parents! We are lucky we have a very informative tour guide who informed us on what to and not to do with the deer in the park to avoid aggressive behaviors of them. If you feed them, they will surely gather",
          "The deer here were VERY aggressive towards my children, they kept ramming them and knocking them down. One knocked my 3 year old son by the nub of a horn (they had already de-horned these creatures) and flung him through the air like a football. I hope that my children aren't",
          "I always imagined deers to be too uptight and ready to flee upon sensing the presence of people, but these deers made me appreciate them up close, so friendly. Be careful though feeding them, because once a deer gets a piece of acorn or deer food, the rest would gang up on you,",
          "Unlike other park..this park is a home of hundreds of deer. You can feed the deer by buying a biscuit which cost you 200 yen..however don't be afraid..since you hold the biscuit a lot of deer will coming to get the biscuit instantly..the park is clean..if you continue to explore",
          "It was a fun place for friends, families and couples. Note that you will need to buy biscuits to feed the deers (do not feed them with outside food). The deers are so smart, they learnt to bow their heads to beg for food, they are so very cute!",
          "Such a nice place to visit... you can walk around with a lot of deers... you can also feed them with some food they sell locally.. But be careful not to have spare food in you pockets because they can easily find them LOL). We enjoyed a lot!!!",
          "There are many deer here and they are rather calm until there is food. However, when you bow to the deer, some of the deer will bow back which is very cute. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while strolling in the park. Love the environment.",

          "Visited the park in mid Jan and was charged 200 yen for deer biscuits. Although wild, the deers are so used to Humans they almost seem docile, just minding their own business in this protected park. Animal instincts kick in when it comes to feeding with some, so conditioned,",

          "We were a group of four friends from Serbia visiting Japan for the first time. We have heard about Nara, its nature and dears, but honestly, we were not well informed about its historical and cultural importance. However, we were quite lucky to meet Mrs Reiko Imayoshi at the JR",
          "The park itself is gorgeous and definitely worth the visit. You can spend a whole day here without getting bored if it wasn\u2019t for the hordes of tourists. There are just too many people making the place crowded and loud. They should initiate some type of a reservation system to",
          "Unusual and surprising place to go where you can find thousand of deers begging for cookies (you better dont play with them), Great Buddha statue, shrines, amazing architecture and beautiful park. It's really easy to go there from Kyoto or Osaka (less than hour by train).",
          "Nara is a must visit on your itinerary but keep in mind that you move near or through Nara Park to see most sights. The travel brochures that show a few isolated deer wandering around miss the fact that there are absolutely 1000\u2019s of deer and they get close and personal as",
          "Loved my time here, although I was here at the hottest time of day. The deer are amazing and I can only imagine what the place looks like at 5pm. The stroll through is lovely with lots of temples to see. I really enjoyed being able to escape the heat at the refreshment area",

          "Going to Nara Park is a must do if you are in Kansai area. We went on a day trip on our own, riding the train from Kyoto to Nara. A few minutes walk from the train station, we experienced our 1st encounter with the deers who were just lazing around waiting for people to feed",
          "From the nearest train station (Kintetsu Nara Station) all the way to the park was an experience in itself. There's a local shop which sells and make super delicious mochi on the spot so its piping hot and ohh so delicious! Its was a perfect day, sunny and not so cold to feed",
          "Must do for animal lovers! Deers roam freely through the park, spread over 500acres. Very friendly, though not overly interested if you don\u2019t buy the biscuits. Packs of biscuits can be purchased around the park for 150yen (approx $1.70 AUD)",

There are vendors at the entrances selling biscuits. Cash only. There\u2019s a lake for a short walk and restaurants to",
          "Strolling around this park and feeding crackers for deer is the reason coming to Nara. Deers are walking in the park freely and they are not shy to ask for foods. We had fun here, they are not so wild as I thought. I was with my young kid. I was so nervous when I saw my daughter",
          "Being around these amazing deer was a wonderful experience. But I also came away horrified. I was aware that the deer eat plastic which messes up their digestive system, and die as a result. The reality of this issue struck me when I spotted a doe fully invested in an empty",

          "We got to Nara around noon. We walked to the park where we enjoyed being around deers and giving them cookies that you can buy there. Afterwards we walked to a couple of temples and we saw the Great Buddha which is stunning. We also purchased tickets for the museum that is",
          "The undisputed best part of the city! You can spend days strolling around this park if you so choose, and if you need crackers for deer there are various stalls that sell them all over. There are few places in the world where you can have quite as unique an experience as here.",

          "Don't feed the greedy and aggressive deers in the beginning of the park. There are more friendly ones longer into the park. The park in it self is very pretty and many places you can avoid the crowds. Feeding and watching the deer is a big plus.",

          "It's a beautiful place, green grasses, polite vendors and the deer are everywhere. The deer biscuits are ony150 yen per pack. You can buy them to feed the deer, but be careful when feeding as they will pull and bite the bags. My children enjoyed feeding and patting them,",
          "Accessible by buses from the train station. Never wear brand new or expensive shoes to this park as stepping on the deers' poops are inevitable (they are everywhere, so are the deers). The deers are already used to humans feeding them with the deer senbei (wafers) that you can",
          "Then the deer become more of a nuisance than an attraction. And they are smart enough to see when one buys the \"deer crackers\" from the on-site vendors, so they follow those with treats in hand.",
          "In early April, when there are cherry blossoms everywhere, the weather is great, there are wild (but friendly) deer all around you and eating deer crackers from your hand, some lovely gardens with waterfalls- there is no better place than Nara. In my view it is best covered",
          "Nara Park is a great place to visit. Deer roam everywhere in the city. You can get special crunchy food for them at the stand. It smells good, but do not eat it. It is for deer only!! And say \"bow\" before you feed them. Amazingly they understand English!! They will bow",
          "We really enjoyed our time in the park. There are deer everywhere. Most of them are pretty tame. There were some that were over zealous for food. We noticed that many of them bowed if you bowed to them. The kids took a ton of selfies with them, so it was a good social media",
          "Very relaxing in the park. The deer roam around and some of them will even do the bowing motion if you do it in return for deer cookies. great pictures can be taken as they are very timid but can get a little feisty when they see you holding the deer cookies that you buy for",
          "Firstly do note the deer are wild, they are not in any form of captivity so there is no fear of mistreatment or them being forced to be there. That being said they are looked after well due to their standing in local culture and beliefs so they are taken care of. It is amazing",
          "We went to Nara park in July. It was hot and cloudy. Deer poo everywhere but fairly easy to avoid because it wasn\u2019t raining. 10 deer cookies are 150 yen and I bought 4. There deer are friendly, just don\u2019t annoy them or make sudden movements. Also the deer are hungry and more",
          "A short walk out from the train station, the deer are walking around, sitting under the trees, etc. There is a small stand where 2 elderly women are selling crackers in bunches - to feed the deer. Be careful! The deer will walk over to you, a little too aggressive for me! I",
          "A wonderful experience walking together with these beautiful animals that fearlessly approach and caress each other. Visit to the park of Nara It is a unique experience for both body and soul. If you can stay in Nara a whole day is a truly magical place",

          "Worth the trip to Nara, even if just for a day or overnight, to see the scale of deer and their quirky little personalities. You can buy biscuits to feed the deer for 150Y and some of them become a little more impatient that you feed them at this point! They\u2019re not afraid to",
          "I'm not big into animals or into getting to feed them, so I won't go into that much. Although if you would like to feed the deer, you can pay like 150 Yen to get some food for them. For me, I found visiting Nara in general to be a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle",
          "Trust me, there's a dignified way of \"feeding the deer\" in Nara. For the first time, I uploaded a short video on YouTube about \"feeding the deer in Nara RESPECTFULLY\". If you bow to the deer, they will bow back---and expect to be fed cookies. It beats throwing the cookies at the",

          "Nara Park is highly instagrammed for its closeness to wildlife...really it\u2019s known as Deer Park since everywhere you look are deer! I was excited when we got there and immediately bought a small pack of cookies to feed them. Perhaps it is wise to think out where and when to",
          "I am not sure who was pushier - tourists wanting to take pictures of deer eating or the deer wanting to eat. Nara park is one of those places that is exactly as described. A weird mixture of absolute shambles and great curiosity.The temple itself is probably the most worthwhile",

          "We went to this park and spent almost the whole day. It was so magical being with these lovely deers. We were taking pictures of the temples when a deer came. I was so excited. Then came another one and another one until I realized they are all over me. My brother came to me",
          "Even if the park itself is beautiful it was awful to see all these tourists treating the deers in an inappropriate way.

          "We took a day trip from Kyoto to Nara. We loved feeding the deer, but you need to be careful around them. They can be a bit aggressive trying to get at the biscuits. You just have to not be scared and you will be fine. We also enjoyed the beautiful Temple and park grounds.",

          "Love all the deer walking around. Easy to buy crackers to feed them. They can get aggressive if you done give them the crackers, but one of the coolest experience!",
          "The deer in the park were with so many and very adorable Weather forecast was not great but we were lucky only few drops of rain in our way back We decided last min to rent bikes. As walking to park from JR station is 20 min The bikes were only 700 yen. We cycled through the",
          "Had an absolute blast feeding the deer here. First warning: the deer here are not shy. On the contrary, they can get quite aggressive. (parents of kids please take note!) Once they know you have food, they'll shove you, nip at your pants, push their noses into your hands, and",
          "The park is very nice and designed to host a lot of tourists. The deer are friendly and welcoming especially when you feed them with specific deer crackers. The signs can be improved.",
          "We Enjoyed feeding and petting the deers but, the deer tend to be aggressive and they poke your behind begging for more cookies. We were lucky to see the wisteria in full bloom. \u00a5500 entrance fee was worth it. The deers were roaming freelt.",
          "This is a huge and lovely park, with a great museum and several separate UNESCO sites worth a visit. It's also home to the quasi-tame sacred deer; the deer run the place, and most of the cit near the park, and can get pretty feisty when they think you've got food, to the point",
          "Deers were very cute and gentle. Weather was good, Nice place for a walk. You can buy deer feed for 150yen yo feed the deers. You can also walk through the park to the todaiji temple.",
          "I visited Nara as a day trip from Kyoto. It's about an hour by train. This is a nice park to have a walk in spring. The deer in the park are an attraction. It's fun to watch. Search for the quieter places to escape the crowds.",
          "Awesomely fun place for young and old. By the time we reached Nara, we had seen many deer. Nara's deer has a history of more than 1000 years. They are known as the Oracles, loved and protected. Nara's mascots are deer. There are about 1,200 wild deer in Nara Park. They are very",
          "The main attraction of Nara are the deer roaming the park grounds freely instead of caged or in an enclosure. People can feed the deer with biscuits and take pictures up close. The novelty wears off quite easily though and you notice the negative aspects such as deer poop lying",
          "As soon as you get off the bus you\u2019ll want to buy biscuits and feed the deer. Don\u2019t. Get walking up hill and it gets quieter about 20 minutes in. Go all the way up and we found some younger, less aggressive deer who were more than happy to wait for the biscuits. The views from",
          "Really easy to get here for a day trip from Kyoto. A lot of walking involved, but well worth it to get to see the giant Buddha in that beautiful temple. Other temples and a gorgeous little garden on the way, plus of course, the almost tame deer.",
          "It\u2019s worth going here just to watch the tourists screaming and fleeing from the deer who get a little excited when the food comes out. You need to be careful as they can nip and leave a mark. Watch out for your bags and belongings as they will be into everything looking for a",
          "This park's nearest station is Kintetsu-Nara Station. From the station, it is about 10 to 15 mins walk till you hit the inner park. There are a lot of deers roaming around freely for you to feed. Along the path from the station, there will be some vendors selling the biscuits",
          "Great day trip and worth a visit purely for the todeji and deer park. No where else have I seen deer so tame and willing to come near and interact with humans. If you now and choose the right temperment of deer you\u2019re bound to get a good shot! For example some of the deer at the",
          "There's a lot of cute deers! Nuff' said right? You just need 2-3 hours looking around the area, play with the deers, go to the Big Buddha temple just 10 mins walk away. It was a very simple place to visit, you don't need to rush for anything and it makes it so relaxing to",
          "So this was a visit to allow my 2.5year old to enjoy the company of the deers but the deers nearer to the train station on the way to the park are definitely conditioned to be way more aggressive than they should be. The term gentle deer didn\u2019t go so well with my kid when a deer",
          "The main attraction here is definitely the deers. When you feed them with crackers, they bow you after that. So sweet. You can walk around the park and feed the deers as often as you want. Some of them behave better than others. The park itself is nice, with lovely picture",
          "The park is famous for the deer that roam around freely, you can feed them by buying the crackers food from the side vendor that sells them. But prepare to be surrounded by a lot of them once you start feeding them, they can bow their head every time they ask for food :) just",
          "it was really a good experience for my family specially my kids to have a close encounter with the deers at the Nara park. We fed the deer and they were very tame. you can buy and feed the deer with the deer senbei at 150jpy You can touch them and have photo with them without",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, with Optional Excursion to Nara Park. If you are in a hurry, most likely you can see everything within 2-3 hours. As with most attractions in Japan, very well organized (and of course, extremely clean!). We enjoyed seeing the deer and",
          "Went on a weekday afternoon. A pretty decent walk from the train station. Fun to feed the deer, they were quite tame in the evening. Maybe they were full from all the other tourists feeding them throughout the day.",
          "Managed to cover all the 3 shrines and the deers in Nara within 2 hours upon arriving in Nara. In Japan, everything is well organized and nearby. A day trip is sufficient for those wanting to see the deer",
          "If you really feel lonely in Nara and want to do some socializing, the deer of the Nara Park would welcome you among their midst. Beautiful park that engulfs within its premises shrines, temples, gardens, and deer. If it is a short stay in Nara, do spend a full day at the park.",
          "Nice place for relax and watching deers and feed them with rice crackers which you can buy on every corner. So you can relax and rest before you will continue to enjoying beauty of Nara. Please just really don't feed the deers with anything else or you can harm this beautiful",
          "Nara park is one of the main tourist spots in Japan as who would not love to walk among deer? After a few stops on the train, we arrived at Nara to visit the deer park. Just before the ascent to the park, you will find a famous shop making mochi where the guy beats his hands",
          "The deer at Nara park roam around freely and seek food from visitors. It can get very busy in Nara but still worthwhile checking out these deer.",
          "It pains me to report that the Nara deer of today are in bad shape and mean, unlike the ones of yesteryear's. Back then, they had beautiful & clean fur and were much more friendly. Today, they are dirty and greedy! One stepped on my toes in a rush to fight for food, and oh",
          "Nara is an amazing city, probably the nicest in Japan. Over 1.000 deers are walking on the streets and in the park and you can feed them or play with them. The temple is amazing and the entire atmosphere is really great.",
          "This place is amazing! Not only does it have beautiful historical temples for the adults to see, but all the deers also kept my 2 young kids entertained. They had great fun feeding those deers. Be careful of the males, they get aggressive. This is not to be missed when you",
          "The park itself is a very unique place to walk through, with all the statues and lanterns all about. It would be quite amazing to re-visit when they are all lit (I'm told twice a year). It's very much a park feel, though greatly covered with trees along the stone paths and",
          "A fun place to walk around. The deer are an added bonus. For a price you get these wafers that you feed the deer and they will come feed from your hands. Keep in mind that these are still wild animals and treat them with respect. We noticed a few people tease them with the",
          "nice place to relax, pet friendly deer, feed them and take a strall towards the Todaiji temple. lots of photo opportunities",
          "This is a must-do if you\u2019re in Nara. The park itself doesn\u2019t actually feel that big when you\u2019re walking around it so that might contribute to it feeling very busy. There are lots of little stalls within the park selling deer crackers for 150 yen for around 8 crackers.",
          "You can spend the day in Nara. There are so many deers - not just in the park but around the whole area in the lead up to the temple. You can buy crackers for 150 Yen and the deers will not leave you alone if they know you have food. Best to break them in half so they last",
          "The previous reviews are true. The deer are used to human contact. Buy food for them at your own peril as they will chase and chew on you to get to it. We saw several kids (including 1 of our own) who were really distressed by the agression from some of the deer. Until now I",
          "I do think that it is a great place for all ages since the deer are usually friendly, but I does warn that they are wild animals and they can attack on some occasions. The people there do sell you special deer crackers to feed the deer with and if you to the deer nod the deer",
          "This is one of those places that can easily be one of the most cherished memories of Japan or quickly forgotten. It all depends when you go. If you go during the day, rush hour, evening... I don't think you will be very much impressed. The secret to this place, to have a magical",

          "The deer were so cute! If you have some food (you can buy deer crackers for \u00a5150, but we were also given some acorns by a lovely old man on a bicycle!), they will literally mug you! It was so funny - they don't hurt, but they will nip you (they kept biting my butt!). If you have",
          "These are WILD ANIMALS first and foremost. If you do plan on getting the deer crackers (deer feed sold at every corner of every road and junction in the park), be ready to be a deer magnet - they will come from far and wide to get the cracker out of your hand. We find the deer",
          "Nice litte park in Nara - a good option for a relaxed, cheap day out. You can see the deer, buy deer 'cookies' to feed them, take some lovely photos amongst the cherry blossoms, or just chill out.",
          "Really cute to have lot of deer\u2019s all around you. They are little aggressive so be careful with food and your bags. Apart from that they really are very cute.",

          "I know deers prefer to stay in the wild even if they are easy prey for fierce animals. But Nara is unique, deers roam freely sometimes they gently bonk your bags for cookies. Only feed them sold JPY150 cookies from vendors. I also had my takoyaki here which is so scrumptious.",
          "History, scenery, wildlife, fresh air and exercise - a perfect day out. The deer are more friendly than we imagined possible, especially if you buy the special cookies to feed them. We caught the end of the blossom season which made the day even more special.",
          "This place is pretty cool, deer feeding is a must, if you bow at them they will bow back to you. But be careful, if they think you have food and you turn your back on them, they will bite you on the bum.",

          "The park is very pretty and very big. There are free roaming deer everywhere. The deer are friendly and bow if you bow to them. Please respect the deer and don't tease them with food like I saw some people doing. Yes, they will chase after you if you have food readily available.",

          "I would highly recommend doing a tour to Nara. It's a massive place and apparently has 80 shrines/temples, but the main reason we went was for the deer. There are hundreds roaming around everywhere, and are just so chilled and friendly. When we visited, unfortunately there was a",
          "Day trip on catch from Osaka after visiting Kyoto. The park itself is quite large with many deer roaming freely. They will come to you if you are feeding them with food which can be bought from the stall. The deer do bow when receiving food. There is a large wooden temple in the",

          "Nara park is a beautiful park that houses 1200 deer throughout. They have learnt to bow to receive the special deer crackers you can feed them. However some a pushy and will bite at your jacket if you don\u2019t pay them attention.",
          "We went to Nara to see the deer after seeing online recommendations and also the recommendations of friends. It was fun to see the deer roaming so closely around Nara and to see them 'bowing'. We enjoyed the gardens - really really enjoyed the Isuien and Yoshiken Garden more!",
          "Like others report if you can wake up early and based inTokyo get there by 8:15am to enjoy deer feeding. 150Yen will get you the special Deer Senebi crackers and they can be bought all over the park at the same price. Arrive at Kintetsu station, it\u2019s right on the doorstep of",
          "As you approach Nara Park, you can see as baby deers roaming the park as people. They are pretty harmless and some may pose for pictures with you but if you have a deer biscuit in hand, they will love you!! The deer biscuits are 150 Yen and available along the park by street",
          "Saw so many people feeding any old thing to the deer. If you must then buy the silly deer biscuits but don\u2019t feed them your sandwich or your map. They are completely habituated to people and don\u2019t understand what\u2019s good for them. Just think. What is a deer supposed to eat??",
          "This park is very nice, deer are everywhere. And there are more than you can imagine. You can buy food to give them but they will start following you. They also poop all over so watch your steps.",
          "The buildings are breathtaking and the scale of the park, the Buddhas, temple, pagodas is stunning, but particularly during cherry blossom season it is a tourist zoo. It\u2019s still very enjoyable to visit and you can get good clear views of everything, but if I go again I would",
          "It was a perfect day at Nara. A bit difficult to get there via Osaka since the trains are all confusing. It was nice and sunny outside and there were SOOOOOO many deer! You can get crackers for them for like 5 USD. And it's more than enough to feed them. An amazing",
          "Nice day out in Nara. The deer are fun for every age. All hotspots of Nara are within 20 mins walking distance. Come in spring when the cherry trees are in bloom!",

          "We visited Nara park in March, the weather was so good and it was such a warm day, which definitely helped. It was so much fun to walk around and get to spend some time with the deer - watching them bow politely and getting to feed them biscuits (you can buy these at the park",
          "It is a nice walk thru the park with lots of deer that love human beings for the food they get. They have also been trained to bow, a sign that they are requesting food. Stone lanterns line the path - very large number of these heavy sculptures!",
          "We stayed in Japan for 9 nights, visiting 4 cities, and Nara was one of the highlights from our trip. Despite being rather small, there were a surprising number of temples to visit, a multitude of deers to feed, nice hills to hike and some great restaurants too. The park is",

          "The park is very nice with deers everywhere bit it is crowded. There some spectacular trees, the walk around the park and temple is very easy. The park is clean and well maintained. It was a wonderful visit even with the crowd.",
          "There are a lot of deers here, and some may be quite aggressive, so don't attract too many deers at once, and don't tease them with the deer senbei. Don't feed them with food other than the sika senbei sold inside the park. (These are sold for only 150 yen, so just buy and",
          "An experience you should not miss. The park is just amazing. The local government is so helpful with a lot of free facilities and information points.",
          "It's a great place to visit all year round. Purchase some senbei for the deer and you are gold. Would advise to stay away from the more aggressive male deers though, they tend to bite at your belongings if you taunt them with food.",
          "Yes, if you have time in kyoto then its worth taking the train to Nara to see, feed and touch some of the hundred deers running freely in this huge park. The park has some temples and cherryblossom trees also. There is no entrance free to this park. The deers are cute and you",
          "We went here on our way to temples and shrines. There are deer everywhere. You buy special cookies for 150 yen to feed them. If they see you have cookies they can get a little aggressive. You are supposed to just go ahead and feed the ones close to you and not try and chose. The",

          "If you\u2019re in Osaka or Ky\u014dto you definitely have to take the 30-60min train to nara! Take a walk from the station to the deers. It\u2019s really nice to see and get close to the mostly free animals. Buy some deer crackers and feed them! But be careful \ud83d\ude09",
          "We weren't actually here to feed the deers. However, it was fun seeing them and added to the ambience of the place. The park itself is nothing spectacular.",
          "A day trip to Nara is definitely a possibility from a cruise ship, using local trains and then your best foot forward. Public transport is not expensive and easily accessible. On leaving the port area, 200m to reach the station (C11 Osakako on map) take the dark green line",
          "The scenery was great, sakura were beautiful! However, lots of very noisy tourists. It was so annoying we decided to leave early. Be sure to check Yoshikien Garden, which is right next to Nara Park: free for foreigners, and much more calm than Nara Park!",
          "Do hide the deer biscuits once you had purchased them cos the deers will finish them up within seconds \ud83d\ude2d Do save some further up for cuter deers which are less aggressive and in exchange for better photos",
          "A great park - busy though. The deer really do bow to you and are very happy to be stroked - especially when you have the 'deer biscuits' that you can buy from vendors there. They can smell them a mile off!",
          "There are tons of people and the deer are completely tame. They run up to you if they think you have food. It could be a nice place to walk around but beware of the crowds.",
          "Lots of deers! They are very cute but please note that they are not that kind as you expect. Please beware of your clothes and bags, they may bite it. Don't think bowing means they are politely asking for food, it's a sign of \"I am annoyed\" And.....please do not feed them by",
          "Soo many deer around and a first time seeing them not afraid people, coming up so close in the open. You start feeding one, they all gather and start to surround you and headbutt you for food. Its quite hilarious seeing kids getting surrounded soo fast.",
          "a wonderful natural place! unfortunately when we were there the trees have not yet bloomed, but still a beautiful place! we can only imagine how beautiful it is when everything is pink! Absolutely great attraction are deer at the same way that you can feed bought cookies!",
          "It's one of highlights in my home town of Nara. Feed the deer and they'll chase you for sometime. It's a great place to see cherry blossom in spring and autumn colors in fall.",
          "If you enjoy parks, temples, and deer, head over to Nara which is a ~35 min train ride from Osaka. The moment you get off Nara Station, you\u2019ll have to take the 10 minute local bus to Nara Park using your IC card that cost 500 yen (reference link for more info). Nara Park is huge",
          "They look cute, friendly and if you bow they will also bow back. Grab a 150 yen deer biscuit and start feeding the deer and that's were it all starts falling apart. The deers are wild, always keep that in mind. Feeding one or two or even three was great experience but as soon",
          "We read articles and traveller's blogs mentioned the deer in Nara Park, we never thought there are so many deer. While it is fun or seem like a must to buy biscuits to feed the deer, but do bear in mind that these are wide deer that had not been tamed. They can be slightly",

          "There are 1000+ deer roaming in the open. The deer feed out of your hands. The smaller deer are pushed away by the larger ones. One has to make an effort to reach the younger ones.",
          "I love this place! After spending time in the hard to grasp craziness of Tokyo or Osaka, Nara is a breath of fresh air. Literally! Other than the amazingly beautiful Todaji temple and the hundreds of bowing, occasionally aggressive (turns out they really, really like 7-11 egg",
          "Me and my partner really enjoyed our trip to Nara Park. Famously to feed the deer, and as well as visiting the various temples. We didn\u2019t expect for there to be a big market on too, which was a plus so we could buy some street food (yakitori, takoyaki etc)",
          "We were told it was really nice, but it was far more than we hoped for! So many lovely things to see, such a nice park surrounding it all, and a ton of super cute domesticated deers. Must see!",

          "If you like deer And cherry blossoms then this park is a good place to get a little outdoor activity in without the crowds of the temples and shrines nearby. Very easy to access on yellow shuttle bus along with the other significant tour stops",
          "Nara Park is a chill place to stroll and visit some shrines. And of course feed deers with the correct food sold by local on site. Males can be slightly aggressive when they smell the biscuits . Very large area to cover",
          "The park has a nice feeling to it. Lots of deers walking around, so be careful with all your snacks and food. If you have any on you, they'll most likely come for it, especially if they can smell it. Visiting there early morning is much nicer, especially for skipping the crowd.",
          "We have been here twice over 9 years, this time with our young boys that loved it as much as us, especially with the deer everywhere and being able to pet and feed them!",
          "What a place. My favourite place in Japan. Its not a zoo. The deer roam freely and you can feed them with food bought off of venders. Watching the deer bow in traditional Japanese fashion toget their snacks is incredible. Do not feed them unless they bow. Place is also",
          "Easy trip from Kyoto - we went for the afternoon. It was a 15-20 minute walk from the station. Huge park with lots of deer, and you can buy \"crackers\" to feed the deer. Kids love it, and it was fun watching people reacting to the deer. I wouldn't want to be there in summer",
          "Going to the Nara Park is definitely the type of an experience you won't ever forget. If you're hesitating whether to take a day trip from Kyoto or Osaka, or maybe even from Tokyo, then don't. Bright green grass everywhere you look, buddhist temples all around and on top of that",
          "Nara park is huge and there are hundreds of deer or all ages. There are three main sites (and lots of minor ones) to visit in the park and it really is fun wandering between them, buying rice biscuits and feeding the deer. We were there on a mild and dry day in February which",
          "Nara park is pretty big. You can wander aimlessly up and turn paths and through and around temple sites. You can also sit and people watch. The deer are also a star attraction. Bring good walking shoes and a mud map.",
          "You will without a doubt visit this park as it is where all the main temples are. At first I felt that the deer were a little exploited but you are overwhelmed with their cuteness. They do expect food and they can try to grab things from you. We did have some amazing experiences",
          "The park itself is nothing special - your typical temple lead-up with vendors and junk food What sets it apart is the deer and the cookies they sell to feed the deer. I hate deer - I live where they eat everything I plant. These guys are no different - they've been fed",
          "Of course you will see Deer in the park and get a chance to feed them. However there is more to see and do in the parl e.g. Toda ji Temple, Kasunga Taish Shrine etc",
          "Spent the afternoon in Nara and wished we had budgeted more time for there. Do at least a full day so you can really explore. The highlight of our trip was, of course, the hundreds of deer at Nara Park. Buy the cookies available for sale and walk around. The older deer seemed to",
          "I find theirs a lot do in the park, not just the deers. Don't forget to bring food for the deer. Nuts and fruit are what they like, the local lady told me. I did not see anywhere I could get any at the park, so bring your own. The rest of the park is beautiful, it's a must see.",

          "Excellent place to visit to breath the Japanese architecture, culture and nature. Three in one. :) As a tourist you become a part of a wonderful Japan. When the Japanese come to Europe, they take photos of everything. Now I understand why! We did the same. Japan is unique!",

          "It's 45 mins train travel from Kyoto station. You can buy food for deer. Best way is to break the cookies into small pieces. So you can feed more and will be able to get more time to click a picture. Some food shops are there .",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "T\u014ddai-ji (\u6771\u5927\u5bfa, Eastern Great Temple) is a Buddhist temple complex that was once one of the powerful Seven Great Temples, located in the city of Nara, Japan. Though it was originally founded in the year 738 CE, Todai-ji was not opened until the year 752 CE. Its Great Buddha Hall (\u5927\u4ecf\u6bbf Daibutsuden) houses the world's largest bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana, known in Japanese as Daibutsu (\u5927\u4ecf). The temple also serves as the Japanese headquarters of the Kegon school of Buddhism. The temple is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara\", together with seven other sites including temples, shrines and places in the city of Nara.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe beginning of building a temple where the Kinsh\u014dsen-ji complex sits today can be dated to 728 CE, when Emperor Sh\u014dmu established Kinsh\u014dsen-ji (\u91d1\u9418\u5c71\u5bfa) as an appeasement for Prince Motoi (ja:\u57fa\u738b), his first son with his Fujiwara clan consort K\u014dmy\u014dshi. Prince Motoi died a year after his birth.\nDuring the Tenpy\u014d era, Japan suffered from a series of disasters and epidemics. It was after experiencing these problems that Emperor Sh\u014dmu issued an edict in 741 to promote the construction of provincial temples throughout the nation. Later in 743 during the Tenpy\u014d era the Emperor commissioned the Daibutsu to be built in 743. T\u014ddai-ji (still Kinsh\u014dsen-ji at the time) was appointed as the provincial temple of Yamato Province and the head of all the provincial temples. With the alleged coup d'\u00e9tat by Nagaya in 729, a major outbreak of smallpox around 735\u2013737, worsened by several consecutive years of poor crops, followed by a rebellion led by Fujiwara no Hirotsugu in 740, the country was in a chaotic situation. Emperor Sh\u014dmu had been forced to move the capital four times, indicating a certain level of instability during this period.\n\n\n=== Role in early Japanese Buddhism ===\nAccording to legend, the monk Gy\u014dki went to Ise Grand Shrine to reconcile Shinto with Buddhism. He spent seven days and nights reciting sutras until the oracle declared Vairocana Buddha compatible with worship of the sun goddess Amaterasu.\nUnder the Ritsury\u014d system of government in the Nara period, Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the S\u014dg\u014d (\u50e7\u7db1, Office of Priestly Affairs). During this time, T\u014ddai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples and for the six Buddhist schools in Japan at the time: the Hoss\u014d, Kegon, J\u014djitsu, Sanron, Ritsu and Kusha. Letters dating from this time also show that all six Buddhist schools had offices at T\u014ddai-ji, complete with administrators, shrines and their own library.\n\nJapanese Buddhism during this time still maintained the lineage of the Vinaya and all officially licensed monks were required to take their ordination under the Vinaya at T\u014ddai-ji.  In 754 CE, ordination was given by Ganjin, who arrived in Japan after traveling over 12 years and six attempts of crossing the sea from China, to Empress K\u014dken, former Emperor Sh\u014dmu and others. Later Buddhist monks, including K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d received their ordination here as well. During K\u016bkai's administration of the S\u014dg\u014d, additional ordination ceremonies were added to T\u014ddai-ji, including the ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts from the Brahma Net Sutra and the esoteric Precepts, or Samaya, from Kukai's own newly established Shingon school of Buddhism. K\u016bkai added an Abhiseka Hall to use for initiating monks of the six Nara schools into the esoteric teachings. by 829 CE.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAs the center of power in Japanese Buddhism shifted away from Nara to Mount Hiei and the Tendai sect, and when the capital of Japan moved to Kamakura, T\u014ddai-ji's role in maintaining authority declined. In later generations, the Vinaya lineage also died out, despite repeated attempts to revive it; thus no more ordination ceremonies take place at T\u014ddai-ji.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Initial construction ===\n\nIn 743, Emperor Sh\u014dmu issued a law stating that the people should become directly involved with the establishment of new Buddhist temples throughout Japan. The Emperor believed that such piety would inspire Buddha to protect his country from further disaster. Gy\u014dki, with his pupils, traveled the provinces asking for donations. According to records kept by T\u014ddai-ji, more than 2,600,000 people in total helped construct the Great Buddha and its Hall; contributing rice, wood, metal, cloth, or labor; with 350,000 working directly on the statue's construction. The 16 m (52 ft) high statue was built through eight castings over three years, the head and neck being cast together as a separate element. The making of the statue was started first in Shigaraki. After enduring multiple fires and earthquakes, the construction was eventually resumed in Nara in 745, and the Buddha was finally completed in 751. A year later, in 752, the eye-opening ceremony was held with an attendance of 10,000 monks and 4,000 dancers to celebrate the completion of the Buddha. The Indian priest Bodhisena performed the eye-opening for Emperor Sh\u014dmu. The project cost Japan greatly, as the statue used much of Japan's bronze and relied entirely on imported gold.  48 lacquered cinnabar pillars, 1.5 m in diameter and 30 m long, support the blue tiled roof of the Daibutsu-den.Maps that include some of the original structures of Todai-ji are rare, though some still exist today. Some of these structures include, the two pagodas, the library, lecture hall, refectory, and the monk's quarters located behind the main hall. Todai-ji functioned not only as a place of worship and Buddhist practice, but as a place of higher learning and study. Much of what contemporaries now know about the original layout of the temple comes from the writings of monks who lived and studied there.\nThe original complex contained two 100 m pagodas, making them some of the tallest structures at the time. They were located on either side of the complex, one on the western (\u897f\u5854) and one on the eastern side (\u6771\u5854). The pagodas themselves were surrounded by a walled courtyard with four gates. These were destroyed by an earthquake. One of the s\u014drin finials survived and is standing at the spot where one of the pagodas used to stand.\nThe Sh\u014ds\u014din was its storehouse, and now contains many artifacts from the Tenpy\u014d period of Japanese history.\n\n\n=== Reconstructions post-Nara Period ===\n\n \nThe Great Buddha Hall (Daibutsuden) has been rebuilt twice after fire. The current building was finished in 1709, and although immense\u201457 metres (187 ft) long, 50 metres (160 ft) wide and 49 metres (161 ft) high\u2014it is actually 30% smaller than its predecessor, being reduced from 11 to 7 bays wide due to lack of funds. Until 1998, it was the world's largest wooden building. It has been surpassed by modern structures, such as the Japanese baseball stadium 'Odate Jukai Dome', amongst others. The Great Buddha statue has been recast several times for various reasons, including earthquake damage. The current hands of the statue were made in the Momoyama Period (1568\u20131615), and the head was made in the Edo period (1615\u20131867).\nThe existing Nandaimon (Great South Gate) was constructed at the end of the 12th century based on Daibutsuy\u014d style, after the original gate was destroyed by a typhoon during the Heian period. The dancing figures of the Nio, the two 8.5-metre-tall (28 ft) guardians at the Nandaimon, were built at around the same time by Unkei, Kaikei and their workshop members. The Nio are an A-un pair known as Ungyo, which by tradition has a facial expression with a closed mouth, and Agyo, which has an open mouthed expression. The two figures were closely evaluated and extensively restored by a team of art conservators between 1988 and 1993. Until then, these sculptures had never before been moved from the niches in which they were originally installed. This complex preservation project, costing $4.7 million, involved a restoration team of 15 experts from the National Treasure Repairing Institute in Kyoto.\n\n\n=== Dimensions of the Daibutsu ===\nThe temple gives the following dimensions for the statue:\nHeight: 14.98 m (49 ft 2 in)\nFace: 5.33 m (17 ft 6 in)\nEyes: 1.02 m (3 ft 4 in)\nNose: 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in)\nEars: 2.54 m (8 ft 4 in)The statue's shoulders are 28 meters across and there are 960 six curls atop its head.  The Birushana Buddha's golden halo is 27 m (87 ft) in diameter with 16 images each 2.4 m (8 ft) tall.Recently, using x-rays, a human tooth, along with pearls, mirrors, swords, and jewels were discovered inside of \nthe knee of the Great Buddha; these are believed to be the relics of Emperor Shomu.The statue weighs 500 tonnes (550 short tons).\n\n\n== Temple precincts and gardens ==\n \nVarious buildings of the T\u014ddai-ji have been incorporated within the overall aesthetic intention of the gardens' design.  Adjacent villas are today considered part of T\u014ddai-ji.  Some of these structures are now open to the public.\nOver the centuries, the buildings and gardens have evolved together as to become an integral part of an organic and living temple community.\nThe T\u014ddai-ji Culture Center opened on October 10, 2011, comprising a museum to exhibit the many sculptures and other treasures enshrined in the various temple halls, along with a library and research centre, storage facility, and auditorium.\n\n\n== Japanese national treasures at Todai-ji ==\n\nThe architectural master-works are classified as:\n\n\n== Major historical events ==\n\n728: Kinsh\u014dsen-ji, the forerunner of T\u014ddai-ji, is established as a gesture of appeasement for the troubled spirit of Prince Motoi.\n741: Emperor Sh\u014dmu calls for nationwide establishment of provincial temples, and Kinsh\u014dsen-ji appointed as the head provincial temple of Yamato.\n743: The Emperor commands that a very large Buddha image statue shall be built\u2014the Daibutsu or Great Buddha\u2014and initial work is begun at Shigaraki-no-miya.\n745: The capital returns to Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, construction of the Great Buddha resumes in Nara. Usage of the name T\u014ddai-ji appears on record.\n752: The Eye-opening Ceremony celebrating the completion of the Great Buddha held.\n855: The head of the great statue of the Buddha Vairocana suddenly fell to the ground; and gifts from the pious throughout the empire were collected to create another, more well-seated head for the restored Daibutsu.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nMatsuo Bash\u014d refers to the Great Buddha statue in a haiku (1689-1670):\n\u521d\u96ea\u3084 /  \u3044\u3064\u5927\u4ecf /  \u306e\u67f1\u7acb.\n\"First snow!/ When Buddha\u2019s great statue/ pillar-erection\"\nAnd,\n\"First snow and / there stands the great Buddha / a pillar of strength\"T\u014ddai-ji has been used as a location in several Japanese films and television dramas. It was also used in the 1950s John Wayne movie The Barbarian and the Geisha when Nandaimon, the Great South Gate, doubled as a city's gates.\nOn May 20, 1994, the international music festival The Great Music Experience was held at T\u014ddai-ji, supported by UNESCO. Performers included the Tokyo New Philharmonic Orchestra, X Japan, INXS, Jon Bon Jovi, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Tomoyasu Hotei, Roger Taylor, classic Japanese drummers, and a Buddhist monk choir. This event, organized by British producer Tony Hollingsworth, was simultaneously broadcast in 55 countries on May 22 and 23, 1994.\nThe 2007 animation series Mononoke (\u30e2\u30ce\u30ce\u602a), which is a spin-off of the 2006 horror anthology series Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, references the T\u014ddai-ji, particularly the treasure room Sh\u014ds\u014din, in Episodes 8 and 9.\n\n\n== International Outreach ==\nFollowing the April 2019 fire that damaged the spire of another UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, Japanese authorities declared plans to expand fire prevention measures at several historic locations including Todai-ji in Nara, partly by hiring new, younger employees in a context where temple and shrine staff are aging.  Custodians of Todaiji temple also installed a donation box, stating \u201cLet\u2019s Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral\u201d, in the hallway behind the Great Buddha statue.  In June 2019, a sign next to the box, in Japanese and English, explained why Todai-ji, as headquarters of the Kegon sect of Buddhism, was soliciting funds in this way. The English version declared, \u201cTodai-ji temple has been reconstructed every time it burned down by big fires thanks to the significant effort of many people.  We sincerely express our deepest sympathy for the tragedy that hit the Notre-Dame de Paris. Going beyond the creed, we would like to ask everyone for your support to reconstruct the cathedral.\u201d\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine, Shinto shrine near the temple precincts\nK\u014dtoku-in, location of the Kamakura Great Buddha\nSh\u014dh\u014d-ji, location of the Gifu Great Buddha\nKanjin#Kanjinshoku of Todai-ji\nNanto Shichi Daiji, Seven Great Temples of Nanto\nFor an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.\nList of National Treasures of Japan (ancient documents)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (temples)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (writings)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts-others)\nOld Government Buildings (Wellington), New Zealand \u2013 second-largest wooden building in the world\nOstankino Palace, third-largest wooden building in the world\nTourism in Japan\nSiege of Nara\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe official T\u014ddai-ji homepage (Japanese) (English)\nTodai-ji Guide GoJapanGo\nPhotos of T\u014ddai-ji Temple, its Lotus Hall and Ordination Hall\nPhotos of T\u014ddai-ji Temple and sika deer\nTodaiji Temple, from The Official Nara Travel Guide\n251381458  T\u014ddai-ji on OpenStreetMap",

          "My third time visiting and always a sight to behold. Deers roam freely nd are known to be messengers from Heaven. Do show your palms to the deers should they look to you for food. This signals that you do not have any to feed them. Feed deers only with the deer biscuits bought",

          "Roving bands of uniformed elementary and middle-school students ply the walk from bus stop to temple asking foreigners questions as a school English project. They're charming! Todai-ji has the huge wooden statues at each Torii, and its approach is well-attended by deer, begging",

          "This place is big. You get here by walking through the South Gate. There\u2019s a somewhat steep price for admittance, but it\u2019s well worth it. I\u2019ve never seen a wooden building so big before. This also has the giant Buddha inside that you can see up close if you pay.",

          "There are an unbelievable number of shrines and temples in Japan, but this is one of the can't-miss ones. The massive Buddha statute and the surrounding statutes are really extraordinary . The $5 USD admission charge is truly nominal for the sights inside. Try your hand at the",

          "This was a fun visit because there is a pole midway through the hall where there is a hole. Apparently if you crawl through the hole it\u2019s good luck. Only children and small people can fit through though. If you like religious places it\u2019s a popular spot. Either way, you can be in",

          "We left Kyoto for Nara as soon as the rush hour was over, but the train was heaving. The same goes for Nara and the Todai-Ji temple. It was a week day as well. Bus loads of tourists. But it was worth it as the temple is impressive. We could see why it was so popular. Suggest one",

          "We visited on a weekday, while there were perhaps not as many tourists as I expected, this was more than made up for by school children of all ages on field trips. Todai-ji also pales in comparison to Kinkakuji and similar Kyoto attractions. If you've been to those then the main",
          "This is a must see if you\u2019re in Osaka, Kyoto or Nara. It is one of the most impressive temples in terms of its size. An imposing wooden structure housing the worlds largest bronze Buddha statue. Not to be missed!",

          "I\u2019m not Buddhist hence probably unable to appreciate the magnificence of the statue. Though impressive in itself. The history is probably more impressive than the look of actual structure as there are many similar such monuments around the world. It\u2019s still a beautiful walk in",

          "In my short stint in Japan, I visited temples and shrines in Osaka, Kyoto and Nara. I found Nara to be the best of the three cities because it\u2019s not wrapped up by concrete all around. In addition, another peculiarities of the city which I really liked are the deers; there are",
          "Lovely temple, beautiful vibes, lots of tourists but you still can find a quiet corner and enjoy the visit. Buddha Vairocana is one of the largest statues of Buddha in the world, the weight is 380 tons.",
          "It was built by an emperor more than a thousand years ago. He used so much bronze, that all of Japan's bronze went into this Buddha statue. There is so much bronze, you can get from level 1 smithing to 100 in runescape just by making bronze swords. I got my 10th goshuin here.",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Nara Park. We enjoyed the Nara Park, and seeing the temple was just an additional bonus. I think it is the biggest wooden building, and I think the bronze Buddha statue is the biggest in the world. Very awesome",

          "I personally enjoyed visiting this temple and it's one of my favourite. There is desciption in english and mandarin for tourist to understand more about the place. Worth the price. The Buddha statue in the Great Hall is mesmerizing.",

          "Definitely a world heritage site, the sheer size of the buddha and its accompanying solid-gold backdrop make for a neat thing to see in person. Walking about an entirely wooden structure of such magnitude built so long ago (far before any machine help) is also impressive. It's",

          "Visited here while in Nara for the day. Very impressive building - especially when you realize it was built 1300 years ago. Worth a visit and a walk around. Costs \u00a5600/pp to enter but worth it. Large buddha is also interesting.",
          "Something that should be on your to do list while in Nara. There are plenty of deers in the lead up to the temple as well as tourist shops. You can get a bus there from the train station that stops at different key sites. A very impressive structure to see while spending your",
          "The bronze Budda is impressive, if it's the biggest one or not doesn't really matter. Beautiful, made the trip to Nara worth it. Loved the other statues as well, but for me the most awesome part is the wooden structure of the temple.",
          "For those people that said previously this is the biggest buddah in the world, they've obviously never been to Thailand (Big Buddah Phuket). The one there atop a mountain is visible from space and makes this temples look insignificant. That said the buddah here is beautiful.",
          "This is a wonderful historical site where there are three giant Buddah statues. The staff do give audio guides for the temple for what I believe is 500\u00a5 (500 Yen), but if you don't want to have a boring audio guide there are free guides in English up until the temple and also",
          "It is one of those touristy places that one just have to see at least once. It has great cultural and historical importance. Dimensions of the main hall, which is also the biggest wooden building in the world, are breathtaking. It pays if you choose your timing for a visit",
          "The entrance gate to the temple is huge and ornate. Cherry blossom trees line the courtyard. On the 2 sides of the entrance are 2 huge statues which represent the beginning and the end of life. The Black Buddha statue is 15 meters high and flanked by 2 golden statues of the",
          "Really very beautiful. The cherry blossoms were falling while we were here as well. As at every shrine, there were charms to buy, but they were very specific to this shrine - a lot of deer souvenirs",
          "This place is really worth getting an admission ticket and going inside. There is a giant wooden statue of Buddha inside the main hall that is unlike anything else. Really worth a visit.",
          "We probably came on the wrong moment as there were many many people around (school buses, etc.). Faire enough, but difficult to get the feel of the place, even though of course, a Very Big Buddha is very impressive. Perhaps try to figure out when the Todai-Ji temple has less",
          "A massive timber temple a large sitting Buddha inside and guardians. There\u2019s also a pillar with a hole in the base - if you can pass through, it\u2019s the path to righteousness - something like that - it\u2019s meant for children and they will love it. Of course it also attracts some",
          "The temple is extremely impressive, as might be expected of the largest wooden building in the world. With the cherry blossoms and blue skies, it feels quintessentially Japanese. The Buddha inside is huge. The place is big enough not to be ruined by the crowds. A must see.",
          "Oh my gosh! This Buddha is so huge it's almost impossible to believe. The size and scale of the original temple is breath taking. We were there during sakurai season and the cherry trees all in bloom was absolutely gorgeous. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot",
          "This is the site of the world's biggest Buddha and it is well worth the time and effort to visit. Large crowds as you would imagine, flock to this attraction and I am sure no one walks away disappointed. Really worth a visit and one not to miss if in this part of Japan.",

          "Now this place is popular. If you would like to take a photo find your spot and wait a couple of minutes and your view will gradually clear and you will get that shot. The bronze statue of the Buddha is huge but you need some scale so a few people in the area will help you with",
          "This place is massive. The gate has two impressive wooden figures on each side. Then the main gallery is home of one of Japan\u2019s biggest Buddha statues. It gets really crowded but due to the size of everything is hard to miss any detail.",

          "We reached this temple and there were already crowds lining up to purchase the entry ticket, which we saw cost 1000yen. We took a look from the outside, and rather headed to mount wakakusa, purchased the ticket for 150 yen and hiked and relaxed for about 3 hours. This temple",
          "No matter where you go, the numbers of crowds are unavoidable especially during this peak Sakura seasons. In order to get a good picture, made your trip as early as possible to avoid the Arrival of tour groups. One could made their prayers here or just as others like me to",
          "This was an interesting temple. It's very large, but there isn't a whole lot to see inside other than the large Budda. It was still worth the few $ we spent to visit however.",
          "We didn\u2019t get to visit the amazing buddha inside, the place was very crowded, but the outside is definitely worth visiting even more so during the cherry blossoms season.",
          "After being in Kyoto you kind of get over all the temples but this is quite spectacular. Very joyful",
          "If you want to see the biggest wooden Buddha in the world, I recommend that you stay in Nara overnight and go there in the morning, before 10am (even better - before 9am). After that, a huge amount of groups will arrive, and I mean, really really really HUGE. And visiting will",
          "Paid to see the giant Buddha and it was worth it. Enormous temple, as it would be to encase a giant Buddha! Awesome sight and low cost entry. Cherry blossom too.",

          "I have see many Buddhist temples all over the world, but this is by far the most impressive, The structure of the huge wooden building alone is something one most see. Inside there is a huge bronze Buddha statue, with a golden next to it representing the time Buddha did not",
          "You won't miss this beautiful temple if you follow the walk path along the Nara Park. There is a gate surrounded the temple, so you won't see much from outside. It is a beautiful temple with big statues, all the statues are magnificent and well detailed. Just a gentle reminder",
          "...beside the deers of course. The giant Buddha\u2019s are big, of course too. The place closes at 5, if you stay until then you will get the chance to make photos without people, but you will need to be \u201cinside\u201d since they put curtains in the main door.",
          "The Buddha statue is huge and magnificent. However, not much is explained in english. Hence, it might make sense to rent audio guide.",
          "You will learn a lot about Japan getting in the temple. All rituals are unique. The history of the temple is amazing. It is a half day tour at least!",
          "The temple is the biggest wood construction and Buddha statue in bronze in the world. Combined with the visit of the deer park makes it worth the day trip to Nara which is 90 minutes away from Kyoto. Entry cost is minimal 600 for the temple and a 1,000 if you also want to visit",
          "It takes a lot to impress me but this place does. The grandeur of the building overwhelms while peaceful. You might think you've seen all of the temples you need to see but you're wrong. This is a must.",
          "If staying in Kyoto, the temptation is not to make the one hour trip to Nara to see yet another temple! We are so pleased that we did take a morning our of the schedule to visit this remarkable structure containing several huge statues, the largest being the bronze Buddha - it",
          "Well crowded places in impressive Buddhist Temple and of course the largest wooden structure in the world. The walkway leading up to the temple is highlighted by all the friendly deer plus many shops. The local bus available outside the train station makes it very easy to get",
          "Take your time to discover this place. It has many things to offer beyond being the largest wooden temple such as a chance to test your ability to reach nirvana, many wonderful buildings and small replicas of the temple as it changed over the years.",
          "We first visited this temple in 2010, and then came back with our two boys ages 5 and 7...9 years later. Its one of our favorites and so impressive, our boys even loved it and were amazed at the large Buddha, and crawled through the pillar!",

          "This is a large Buddhist temple in Nara, which houses the largest bronze Buddha statue in the world in its main hall. The admission fee is on the high side (\u00a5600 to access the temple grounds only, without museum admission), but you'll be greeted with an impressing Buddha statue",
          "We arrived here at the end of the day having walked around Nara Park and feeling rather tired. You can see the main temple from just inside the outer entrance but have to pay (600 Yen) to enter the main temple. We were in two minds whether or not to do so as we had seen two",
          "The temple architecture itself is stunning. The statues of Buddha and Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, sitting peacefully right at the hall facing main entrance, really caught attentions - enormous and holy. The beauty of craftsmanship as well as facial expression bring true peace",
          "It\u2019s really a massive place. We payed the 600 yen each to tour inside. Grab yourself an English speaking guide to understAnd what you\u2019re looking at.",
          "So this is just another temple. *yawn*. They all look pretty much the same but this one has a giant Budda inside it. $10 will get you in to see it. To be honest unless you absolutely must see the giant Budda for yourself I'd take the $10 and go buy lunch. Other than the",
          "We were on the fence whether the 1200 yen admission for two of us would be worth it, but it was. Pictures don't do the Great Buddha justice. It is dizzingly tall and just towers over you.",
          "This temple was built in 710 - 792 AD. It is Vairocana Budddha, meaning Buddha that shines throughout the world like the sun. It serves as both a place of worship/prayer for peace and affluence on earth.",
          "When i saw the picture on google it looks like a regular temple, but in reality its a huge complex. there are also wooden imitation of how the temple got bigger over years and how it looked in the past. the buddha statue is quite unique. Lovely place",
          "We visited on a mid week day (Tuesday) and when there was light rain.I think this was a bonus in keeping the crowds away. We had minimal people to contend with and found the Buddha and the temple interesting. As we stayed in Nara a number of days we passed by on a Saturday and",
          "Different from other Shrines and Temples in Japan, this place really felt like a special place. It's worth the time to walk from the Nara train station to the temple and do the entire round of the place.",

          "Near the Nara Park is the Todai-ji temple. The Great Buddha is extremely impressive as you enter the temple. There are also a number of other Buddha's there. The entire building doesn't take too long to go through, as you walk around the sites there is no opportunity to get",
          "Can be quite busy as it's one of the main attractions. Lovely approach through the park with all of the deer.",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. The huge Buddha was unique and beautiful. Its worth a visit to experience this place. Wasn't too busy the day we went.",
          "If you like huge Buddha statues, large crowds and aggressive deers, you have come to the right place. Take you time to go around the statue, there are good spots to take pictures, and not necessarily at the front where it can get really crowded. There is a hole in a major",
          "This is a very huge and historical temple. The exterior is very grand. You will huge statues of Buddha and other Gods inside the temple. Very impressive and breathtaking. It is about a 10 minute walk from the main road to the temple. While you are walking, you will run",
          "The great buddha is 15 meters and made of bronze. It costs 600 yen the ticket for the buddha. Nice temple. They have a lot of souvenirs there. Es de 15 metros y de bronce. La entrada sale 600 yenes, hay otra aue combina eso y la entrada al museo. Hay venta de souvenirs en el",
          "Fantastic temple experience. We received a free guided tour in English from a lovely volunteer. Probably my favourite temple visit in Japan.",
          "Must visit for all tourists. It costs 600 yen to visit the Buddha Hall and an extra 400 yen for the museum. Recommend coming around 4pm to view the sunset scene. Note that this place closes at 5pm though.",
          "Been there multiple times, everytime was a greater experience than the previous. An amazing temple, a bit too crowded at times, but if you can get past that and enjoy it, it's a must see spot.",
          "Todaiji temple could be reach by using a Bus or by walking from the Kintetsu Nara Station. We chose to walk towards the temple. As we walk, we already started encountering deer roaming around the area, and even on the roads! There are a lot of deer cookie vendor scattered in the",
          "If you're wondering which temple to see near Osaka since there are so many to choose from, I'd definitely choose Todai-ji. Why? Because the trip from Osaka is easy by train, and once you're there it's a casual walk to the temple via the Nara park. Most importantly, especially",
          "Very impressed with the building. Have to see it in you own eye. Not planned to enter initially, but was attracted by it when arrived by the entrance.",
          "No photo could ever do justice to how amazing Todai-ji Temple is in person. It has been the highlight of our entire Japan experience.",
          "Generally I make it a point to visit any temple/shrine in japan if I\u2019m nearby. So during my visit to Nara park I popped by. Personally, I felt a sense of awe when arrived at the temple. It\u2019s not the most majestic of buildings, but perhaps the surroundings blending in with the",
          "We arrived at Todai-ji at 8:15 and there were only a few people. At 9:00, most of the tour buses arrive and it gets very crowded. The temple is very large, but you will need 20 minutes in the temple at a maximum. There are paths leading to many minor sites to visit.",
          "We took a day off Ky\u014dto to go to Nara and we were not disappointed. Todai-ji Temple has amazing ancient buildings with massive Buddha inside. On top you get to walk around semi-wild dears. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "I will definitely be in the minority here, but the Giant Buddha of Todai-ji Temple did absolutely nothing for me. Perhaps it was the crowds, perhaps it was the exhausting summer heat, perhaps it was the darkness inside the temple itself - all I know is I wasn't impressed at all",
          "The Toda ji Zen temple is a wonder by itself. The statue is just wonderful. The temple is just jaw dropping Never seem something so large. .",

          "Nara is surprisingly full of attraction that were noted as World Heritage. This temple is no exception, it is the number one in the list, and we were there to also play with deer, which surprisingly a bit aggressive when fed. The temple ground is very scenic, it has maple trees",
          "This is not only the best temple to visit in Nara, it is also the busiest temple full of tour groups and school groups. However, just to experience the splendor of this temple is indeed wonderful. At the entrance to the main gate is a pond with a small shrine and some great",
          "Todaji Temple is, quite simply, spectacular. The temple building is HUGE and the statues it houses are incredible in both size and beauty. In my opinion, if you only see one thing in Nara, this has to be it.",

          "It takes you an auspicious time for Calm and Serene in mind to visit this holy place. You will enjoy the Deers that push their heads against you for crackers or pieces of bread. Be careful of them to take the paper tissues or plastic wrappers of sandwich from your holding",

          "Todaiji Temple is a must for visitors to Nara. The structure is an architectural wonder of the Tang Dynasty building style that can scarcely be found in full integrity even in China, and in such excellent condition. One is easily awe struck by its dignity and grandeur. The",

          "The temple buildings are set in a widespread park full of a peaceful mix of tourists and small deers. It's a pity the great wooden masterpieces inside the main tori had to be kept behind an iron web, in the dark, because they are as interesting as the great buddha. Well kept and",

          "It was very crowded when we arrived at this temple, but it was a warm, inviting Friday afternoon. The Buddha statue was certainly worth a visit, despite the crowd. There were scale models of the temple complex on display as well. I suggest going earlier in the day if you want",
          "Todai-ji is one of several temples in Nara, but its sheer size is awe-inspiring making it the best (and the size of the golden Buddha inside it). It takes about 30 mins to an hour to have a good look around the site and it is important to visit the smaller temples in the area",

          "I thought the Nandai-mon gate was impressive then I saw the Daibutsu-den Hall (which is supposed to be one of the biggest wooden buildings in the world). It was incredible, I thought it was even more amazing than the Great Buddha who lives inside. A must see.",
          "Have seen many large Buddha statues, so it wasn't the first time that I was seeing one, But the outside structure where the Buddha is housed and the entire experience is well worth the effort if you have a day (or even 5 hours to spare if you are in Kyoto).",
          "Well.. There is a huge statue of Buddah. And a temple. Thats it. Cool and all but do not expect more than that.",

          "Even if you only have a few hours to spare during you trip to Japan, go see this temple in Nara. The temple is the size of a cathedral, and made of wood. The Buddha is too large to describe - you need to see it. Pay attention to the replica lotus flower petals at ground level,",
          "Loved going in, so much respect shown to the buddhism religion. There is also a hole that kids crawl through and if you can fit through then you will receive good luck. I managed to fit through even though I'm was 19",

          "The sheer scale of this wooden building is jaw dropping. Giant tree trunks form the uprights and the craftsmanship and skill required to cast a bronze Buddha of that size is extraordinary. Todai - ji is on all the tour bus hit lists so get there early to avoid the masses . The",

        "wiki": "Heij\u014d Palace (\u5e73\u57ce\u5bae, Heij\u014d-ky\u016b) was the imperial residence in the Japanese capital city Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (today's Nara), during most of the Nara period. The palace, which served as the imperial residence and the administrative centre of for most of the Nara period from 710 to 794 AD, was located at the north-central location of the city in accordance with the Chinese models used for the design of the capital.\nThe palace consisted of a large rectangular walled enclosure (the daidairi), which contained several ceremonial and administrative buildings including the government ministries. Inside this enclosure was the separately walled residential compound of the emperor or the Inner Palace. In addition to the emperor's living quarters, the Inner Palace contained the residences of the imperial consorts, as well as certain official and ceremonial buildings more closely linked to the person of the emperor.\nThe original role of the palace was to manifest the centralised government model adopted by Japan from China in the 7th century\u2014the Daij\u014d-kan and its subsidiary Eight Ministries.  The palace was designed to provide an appropriate setting for the emperor's residence, the conduct of great affairs of state, and the accompanying ceremonies.\nAfter the capital was moved to Heian, the palace structures were either moved there or suffered several fires and other disasters and disappeared. The site was built over for agriculture that almost no trace of it remained, however the location was still known. Excavations started in the 1970s and large-scale reconstruction based on contemporary literary sources and excavations starting in the 2000s.\nThe excavated remains of the palace, and the surrounding area, was established as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 along with a number of other buildings and area, as the \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOne year after Empress Genmei's succession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in Keiun 4 (707 AD), a rescript was issued deciding on the move from Fujiwara-kyo near Asuka towards the northern edge of the Nara basin. In Wad\u014d 3 (710 AD), the new capital was officially established, but the completion of the palace had to wait further. The new capital city's name was written Heij\u014d (\u5e73\u57ce) but also pronounced Nara at the time.\nThe city, and the palace grounds, was based largely on Chang'an (present-day Xi'an), the capital of China during the Tang dynasty, which was contemporary to the time when Nara was capital. Chang'an was in turn, like many ancient east Asian cities, based on a complex system of beliefs & laws of geomancy. This dictated the grid system of streets, as well as the necessity for spiritually protective shrines or temples to be placed at particular cardinal directions around the city. The city area measured six kilometres from east to west and five kilometres from north to south.\nIn accordance with this system, the palace was placed at the northern end, on an extended line from Suzaku Street, the main thoroughfare running north-south straight through the centre of the city. The street ended at the Suzaku Gate, and the rest of the palace buildings were then placed beyond to the north of this gate. The primary buildings of the palace compound were the Daigoku-den, where governmental affairs were conducted, the Ch\u014dd\u014d-in where formal ceremonies were held, the Dairi, the emperor's residence, and offices for various administrative agencies.\nThe Nara period covers 75 years from 710-784 AD. Emperor Sh\u014dmu moved the capital to other places such as Kuni-kyo and Shigaraki-kyo in the period between 740-745 AD. The imperial buildings and governmental offices were drastically transformed around this period. In the later Nara period, the audience hall was erected in the eastern part, at the south side of the imperial domicile. This is called the latter audience hall. A number of buildings in the imperial domicile and the governmental offices were replaced and renovated several times. This was probably not due to the repair of the old buildings but due to another reason.\nWhen the capital was moved to Heian-ky\u014d (now called Kyoto), Nara's Imperial Palace was simply abandoned. Over the ensuing centuries, the ravages of time and the elements slowly destroyed the buildings, until by the beginning of the Kamakura Period in the late 12th century there was practically nothing left above ground. However, those sections that lay underground were preserved, and re-discovered by modern archaeologists.While the site was designated Special Historical Site by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in 1952, archaeological efforts headed by the National Research Institute for Cultural Properties, such as excavations are continuing since 1959. The Suzaku Gate and East Palace Garden have been restored and opened to the public in 1998. The Takenaka Corporation was mainly responsible for the reconstruction.Heij\u014d Palace was the main event site of Commemorative events of the 1300th anniversary of Nara Heij\u014d-ky\u014d Capital (Japanese:\u5e73\u57ce\u9077\u90fd1300\u5e74\u796d) in 2010, and the First Daigokuden(\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5927\u6975\u6bbf) was restored for the occasion. In commemorative events of the 1300th anniversary, a variety of seasonal events were held throughout Nara Prefecture.\n\n\n== Structures ==\n\n\n=== Suzaku Gate ===\n\nThe main entrance to the capital through the Suzaku Avenue was the Raj\u014d Gate (\u7f85\u57ce\u9580, Raj\u014dmon). The main avenue was approximately 75 metres wide and extended north for 3.7 kilometres up to the Suzaku Gate (\u6731\u96c0\u9580, Suzakumon). The name \"Suzaku\" derives from the Chinese name for the legendary bird which acted as a southern guardian. The palace was surrounded by great earthen walls and had twelve gates, with the Suzaku Gate as largest gate and the main entrance. The southern open spaces was part of the avenue, and the Nij\u014d-\u014dji (the second great street) approximately 37 metres wide was extending in the east-west direction in front of the gate.\nThe gate measured 25 metres in width and 10 metres in depth, with 22 metres in height. Built on a platform, the gate was probably a two-storied structure, conspicuously larger than the other gates of the palace. The open space to the front was used for ceremonies such as New Year celebrations. It was reconstructed in 1998.\n\n\n=== Second Street and Mibu Gate ===\nThe Second Street was a major thoroughfare running east-west along the southern side of the palace precinct. Around 35 metres in width, it was second only to Suzaku Avenue in size. The Suzaku Gate, which was the main gate, together with the Mibu Gate to its east and the Wakainukai Gate to its west, all opened onto this avenue.\nIn the latter half of the Nara period, the Great Hall of State and the Halls of State compound that comprised the centre  of politics shifted to the eastern sector of the precinct. The Mibu Gate served in effect as the main gate to the palace.\nThe area immediately to the south of the Second street is known to have been used for state offices and detached residences located outside the palace grounds, and was thus a district rivaling the palace itself in importance.\n\n\n=== Greater Palace ===\nThe daidairi was a walled rectangular area extending from north to south between the first and second major east-west avenues and from west to east between the north-south avenues.\nThe three main structures within the Greater Palace were the Official Compound (\u671d\u5802\u9662, Ch\u014dd\u014d-in) and the Inner Palace (\u5185\u88cf, Dairi).\n\n\n=== Ch\u014dd\u014d-in ===\nThe Ch\u014dd\u014d-in was a rectangular walled enclosure situated directly to the north of the Suzaku Gate in the centre of the southern wall of the Greater Palace. It was based on Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the 7th century onwards.\n\n\n=== Former audience hall ===\n\nThe Great Hall of State (\u5927\u6975\u6bbf, Daigokuden) was the most important state building in the palace. It was facing south at the northern end of the compound. It was the largest building, measuring 44 metres in width and 20 metres in depth, with a height of 27 metres. The hall was thought to have been a two-storey Chinese-style structure with a hipped and gabled roof, and an open front fa\u00e7ade having no doors.\nNo data directly indicating the audience hall's true appearance have survived. For the reconstruction, locations of the pillars were inferred through reference to the building's remains at Kuni-ky\u014d, to where it had been relocated. For the upper part of the building, research was conducted on the main hall of H\u014dry\u016b-ji, the eastern pagoda of Yakushi-ji, and other buildings that survived from the Nara period. The depiction of the Heian Palace audience hall depicted in the Nenchu gyoji emaki (Illustrated scroll of annual events and ceremonies) was also consulted.\nThe reconstruction was started in 2001 and completed in 2010. For the reconstruction, Japanese cypress wood was used. The building's pillars and beams were painted in vermilion, the walls in white, the roof with ceramic tiles. The upper part of the interior of the hall was painted with symbols of the Chinese zodiac such as the Tiger, the Horse and the Ox alongside the walls, and floral pattern on the ceiling. The paintings were executed by the renowned painter Atsushi Uemura based on designs from the Nara period.\n\n\n==== Takamikura ====\nIn the middle of the audience hall was the emperor's throne, called Takamikura (\u9ad8\u5fa1\u5ea7). This was an important item that symbolised the imperial office, and at state events such as the enthronement and New Year's Day ceremonies the emperor proceeded to the audience hall and took his seat on the throne. Nobles lined up in the inner court south of the hall and paid their respect.\nWith no records of the construction or design of the Takamikura of the Nara period, the details are unknown. The reconstructed model of the Takamikura was made after experts consulted various literature and historical materials, and based on the throne in the Kyoto Imperial Palace which dates to the Taish\u014d era. Details of the design and patterns were created by referring to materials such as the treasure of the Sh\u014ds\u014din repository.\n\n\n=== Office of Foods ===\nThis area, stretching northward from the centrally located Great Hall of State, is believed to have been the site of the Office of Foods. This office stocked foods other than the rice that was paid as tax, and was in charge of providing meals for state banquets and rituals held in the palace.\nSurrounding a large well, itself provided with a roof and from which numerous eating utensils have been excavated, stood a group of buildings used as offices and storehouses. The first inscribed wooden tablet recovered from the palace site was found in 1961 in a rubbish pit belonging to this office.\n\n\n=== Latter audience hall ===\nThe latter audience hall dates to the time after the capital was re-established after the relocation from Shigaraki.\nTraces of the platforms of the latter audience hall and the eastern state halls had remained by the Meiji era, which led to the discovery of the site by Sekino Tadashi, a researcher of architecture history. Tanada Kajuro, a local gardener, worked on a public movement for protection of the site.\nThe area on the north side of the latter audience hall is the site of the imperial domicile.\n\n\n=== Imperial Domicile ===\nThe emperor and empress lived, worked and received visitors in the imperial domicile section. It was surrounded by a roofed walkway, divided lengthwise by an earthen wall. The Office of the Court Ladies was also located here.\nInside the imperial domicile was a stone-paved area containing a large well, which remains were found in 1973. The well was lined with a solid cedar tube carved from a log 1.7 metres in diameter. The water from this well was probably for the exclusive use of the emperor and empress. The site was reburied and the wall was reconstructed with new materials as an outdoor exhibit.\n\n\n=== Office of the Imperial Household ===\nIn this section to the east of the imperial domicile, is what is thought to have been the Office of the Imperial Household (\u5bae\u5185\u7701, Kunai-sh\u014d). It was surrounded by an earthen wall, 90 metres in length to the north and south and 50 metres wide from east to west. Six buildings stood in this compound. The main one was roofed with tiles, the others with cypress bark.\nThe building were reconstructed in accordance with the findings of the archaeological excavations, following the Nara period construction techniques.\n\n\n=== East Palace Garden ===\n\nArchaeological excavations uncovered remains of a large garden in the southeast corner of the palace in 1967. This was named \"East Palace Garden\" (T\u014din Teien) because the neighbouring area is considered to be the site of the East Palace.\nWithin the area measuring 80 metres from east to west and 100 metres from north to south. Several buildings were located around a curvilinear pond. In the vicinity of the site, Empress Sh\u014dtoku had the \"Jewelled Hall of the East Palace\" constructed, in which banquets were held.\nThe excavations revealed that the garden was originally built in the Chinese style of the early Nara period, and modified in a Japanese style of the late Nara period. The garden was reconstructed in 1998.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties has conducted research and investigation of the site on a continual basis since 1959. The Nara Palace Site Museum exhibits the results of the excavations. It consists of galleries for the palace and its administrative offices, artifacts, archaeological science, and special exhibitions.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nIt takes 15 or 20 minutes to walk from Yamato-Saidaiji Station to Heij\u014d Palace. And between May and August in 2010, the free shuttle bus runs between Yamato-Saidaiji Station, JR Nara Station and Heij\u014d Palace every 10 or 15 minutes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKy\u016bseki Teien, a garden located at Sakyo Sanjo Nibo constructed around the same time\nHeian Palace\nList of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Heij\u014d Palace at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNara Palace Site Museum(in Japanese)\nHeijokyu Imperial Palace, from The Official Nara Travel Guide\nOfficial UNESCO page\nGeomancy and Imperial Position in Nara\nExcavation report The Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan.",

        "wiki": "Kasuga Grand Shrine (\u6625\u65e5\u5927\u793e, Kasuga-taisha) is a Shinto shrine in Nara, Nara Prefecture, Japan. It is the shrine of the Fujiwara family, established in 768 CE and rebuilt several times over the centuries.  The interior is famous for its many bronze lanterns, as well as the many stone lanterns that lead up the shrine.\nThe architectural style Kasuga-zukuri takes its name from Kasuga Shrine's honden (sanctuary).\nKasuga Shrine, and the Kasugayama Primeval Forest near it, are registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara\".\nThe path to Kasuga Shrine passes through a deer park. In the park, deer are able to roam freely and are believed to be sacred messengers of the Shinto gods that inhabit the shrine and surrounding mountainous terrain. Kasuga Shrine and the deer have been featured in several paintings and works of art of the Nambokucho Period.  Over three thousand stone lanterns line the way. The Man'yo Botanical Garden is adjacent to the shrine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe birth of this shrine, according to legend, began when the first kami of Kasuga-taisha, Takemikazuchi, rode on the back of a white deer to the top of Mount Mikasa in 768 CE. This kami is said to have traveled from the Kashima Jingu Shrine in order to protect Nara.  The shrine location first received favor from the Imperial government in the Heian period as a result of the power from the Fujiwara family as well as Empress Sh\u014dtoku.From 1871 through 1946, Kasuga Shrine was officially designated one of the Kanpei-taisha (\u5b98\u5e63\u5927\u793e), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.\n\n\n== Religious significance ==\nThe four main kami enshrined here are Ame no koyane, Himegami, Futsunushi no mikoto, and Takemikazuchi no mikoto. Though these are the primary divine beings of Kasuga taisha, they are often grouped together as a syncretic, combined deity known as Kasuga Daimy\u014djin. Kasuga Daimy\u014djin is composed of five divine beings and each consists of a Buddhist deity and Shinto kami counterpart. The fifth deity, Ame no oshikumone, was added much later and is said to be the divine child of Ame no koyane and Himegami. The importance of the multifaceted kami was that it became a template for future worshipers who wanted to combine several deities to pray to at once.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe architectural style of Kasuga-taisha comes from the name of its main hall (honden) known as Kasuga-zukuri. The shrine complex is protected by four cloisters and contains a main sanctuary, treasure house, several different halls, and large gates. One beautiful aspect of this shrine is the many wisteria trees known as \"Sunazuri-no-Fuji\" that bloom in late April and early May. This shrine is also home to over 3,000 lanterns which are made of either stone or bronze. An entire hall is devoted to them which is Fujinami-no-ya Hall but the lanterns are only lit during the Setsubun Mantoro and Chugen Mantoro festivals.\nThe four main kami each have a shrine devoted to them which are all in the same architectural style. They are characterized by sloping gabled roofs, a rectangular structure, katsuogi (decorative logs), and chigi (forked roof structures). The first hall established is dedicated to Takemikazuchi no mikoto, the second to Futsunushi no mikoto, the third to Amenokoyane no mikoto, and the final hall is attributed to the consort, Himegami. Several auxiliary shrines lie outside the main sanctuary that are dedicated to lesser kami. One is allotted to Tsunofuri no kami, that is commonly known as Tsubakimoto Jinja Shrine or Kayabusa Myojin. Kasenomiya Jinja Shrine is attributed to Shinatsuhiko no mikoto and Shinatsuhime who are kami of the winds. Wakamiya Jinja Shrine, created in 1135 CE, is one of the more prominent auxiliary shrines because it houses the kogami, or offspring kami called Ame no Oshikumono no mikoto. The primary worship here revolves around vengeful gods and the dead and is the location of the Kasuga Wakamiya festival.\nThe Treasure House at this shrine contains hundreds national treasures as well as about many other cultural properties, most of which are from the Heian period. Some of the most noteworthy items that reside here are ornate taiko drums used in gagaku from the Kamakura period, arrows with crystal whistles from the Heian period, and bronze mirrors of the Heian and Nanboku-cho periods.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nDuring the festivals of Setsubun Mantoro (February 3) and Chugen Mantoro (August 14\u201315), three thousand shrine lanterns are all lit at once. The Setsubun Mantoro refers to the celebration of the seasonal shift from winter to spring while the Chugen Mantoro relates to the transition of summer to fall. They both takes place in order to celebrate the Obon and Setsubun holidays in Japanese culture. At Kasuga Grand shrine, people are seen writing and attaching their wishes, or ema, to the lanterns before lighting them during both festivals. Additionally, it is said that tossing dried beans at these times will ward off bad luck in the future.March 13 is the Kasuga Matsuri, a local festival which features the dances of gagaku and bugaku. Shinto women perform traditional Japanese Yamato-mai dances that date back to the Heian and Nara periods. This festival also holds a horse celebration which consists of a parade through the streets by a \"sacred\" horse. One will see people dressed in traditional costumes of the Heian to Edo periods and can experience authentic kagura dance displays with dengaku music.\nThe Kasuga Wakamiya Festival takes place at the Wakamiya Jinja shrine from December 15 to 18th each year. The main goal of this gathering was to ward off disease while promoting new growth for the spring. Like Kasuga Matsuri, attendants can see kagura performances along with a procession in traditional attire.\n\n\n== Kasugayama Primeval Forest ==\nKasugayama Primeval Forest is primeval forest of about 250 hectares (620 acres) near the summit of Kasugayama (498 metres (1,634 ft)), and contains 175 kinds of trees, 60 bird types, and 1,180 species of insects. In this area adjacent to Kasuga Grand Shrine, hunting and logging have been prohibited since 841 CE. Because Kasugayama has long been tied to Kasuga Grand Shrine worship, it is regarded as a sacred hill. The forest backdrop of the Kasuga Grand Shrine's buildings today has been unchanged since the Nara period.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Shinto shrines\nTwenty-Two Shrines\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts-others)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts-swords)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (shrines)\nDeer (mythology)\nModern system of ranked Shinto Shrines\nKasuga Maru\nList of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site in Japanese\nKasugataisha Shrine, from The Official Nara Travel Guide\nMt.

          "The shrine itself was attractive, and the forest trail to the shrine was even more attractive. Deers roam around the forest and on the trail so you\u2019d see lots of them on the way. They were accustomed to the pilgrims. Once you get to the shrine there is a reception for visitors",

          "Another amazing UNESCO Heritage site to visit in Nara. Nara is easily accessible via train either from Kyoto or from Osaka. Enjoy the free running deers and also this Kasuga Taisha shrine. Beautiful view, leisure walk. You will not regret it.",
          "Another beautiful Shinto shrine with the vermillion tori gates, to ward off evil. This complex has 100's of stone and bronze lanterns which have been donated by worshippers since 8th century. At certain times of the year, on specific occasions, all these lanterns are lit, must",

          "It felt like a long walk uphill to get to this shrine and when we did get there we were a bit disappointed with what there was to see. The shrine does have both Goshuin and free stamps for your notebook available. If I had my time again, I would probably skip this.",
          "Kasuga Grand Shrine is another nice shrine in Nara. You need to walk along the pathway with tall trees and stone lanterns on both sides. The environment is quiet and peaceful with less crowds of visitor. If you want to enter the inner part of the shrine, you need to pay the",

          "Kasuga Shrine is a gorgeous place to visit. The vermillion and green of the shrine and lanterns is quite beautiful but the walk to the shrine, through the forrest along a path lined with lanterns is what really makes the visit.",
          "This shrine is another of the recommended places to visit in Nara. We walked there from Todai-ji temple, and took the opportunity to interact with the numerous deer along the way. It's a nice walk there along a tree lined path. The shrine itself was quite crowded and seemed like",
          "This is quite a huge shrine but I find it a bit too touristy. As a result, I didn't pay the extra 500 yen to enter the inner shrine. Perhaps you should check out the inner shrine.",

          "It was raining which made the walk to the shrine less fun than it should have been but I was interested to see all the different stone lanterns. Paid 500 yen to get into the inner shrine which was well worth it. More lanterns, quieter and a special area where they had a",
          "Chanced to see this place while roaming around Nara park and I am so glad we decided to visit. Its involves a little uphill climb but quite manageable for someone like me with average fitness. Not for the elderly with mobility issues though. The place is stacked with lanterns",
          "There is quite a hustle bustle walking up to this temple. Even within the premises there is a lot of people (I went during high tourist time of the year ) Pay the small entry fee and go inside to see the 1000 lanterns. Even more there is a little dark room with so many",
          "It's a bit of a hike up though the park but for the UNESCO status and the crowds going there, I might have ignored it. Stone lanterns line the route and the local deer, always hungry for food from a tourist are everywhere. Pass a few of the minor temples, then go through the",
          "Walking through the deer garden (there are real deer in there) up to the shrine is a more relaxed walk. The shrine itself is nice, pay the entrance fee to see the inner shrine, well worth it, specially the lantern room.",
          "We walked through the Nara deer park up to this temple at 5pm on a clear autumn day. Many of the crowd had gone home after their day trips from Kyoto. As we approached the temple up the stone lantern lined path, everyone else was leaving as it had \u2018closed\u2019. It was getting dark",
          "Wonderful shrine! It was our last shrine of our Japan trip. We completed our goshuin book in this shrine and we were happy because the stamp has a deer on it which represents Nara completely \u2661. We were surprised to see the amount of lamps and it was beautiful to see the contrast",
          "The path leading to the shrine is lined with stone lanterns, and many more nestled in the woods. The main shrine is recently renovated. The color of the shrine is in vivid orange red. There are many bronze/metal lanterns hanging along the wall of the buildings. This is a great",

          "Walking up to this area is fantastic, as you can see the hundreds of stone statues where lanterns are placed. The temple itself can be admired in part without entering, and there are deer all about.",

          "Our tour made a short stop here and it was worth getting of the bus for, there are almost three thousand lanterns (2/3 stone, 1/3 brass) on the grounds. The stone lanterns are along the path leading to the temple and make for some beautiful pictures, especially if a deer walks",
          "Our tour spent a half hour at this \"Lantern Shrine\" The walk to the shrine is bordered by many moss covered stone lanterns. There are more bronze lanterns at the shrine proper. Our guide told us that they are all lit twice a year during lantern festivals in February and August.",

The must-visit temples in Nara, in my opinion,",
          "This was our 3rd place we visited in Nara Park. It also had the least number of visitors during our visit compared to the other 2 temples. The path leading to the shrine was lined with hundreds of concrete lanterns of various shapes and sizes. When we arrived at the shrine,",
          "Architecture, style, color, stone and bronze lanterns, and history are some of the aspects that make a visit here worthwhile. This is Nara's most celebrated shrine dating back to the Nara Period (710-794 AD) and the Heian Period (794-1185 AD). Plenty of smaller shrines exist in",

          "There is not much to see from the front view outside the ticketing entrance. I paid 500 yen (worth it) to enter the walking path, which is quite long though some paths are in circles. The lines of lanterns are marvelous to view at if you appreciate the different ways they are",
          "There are so many old lanterns on the way up to this temple set in beautiful parklands and of course surrounded by deer. You can choose whether to visit just the front part of the temple or pay 500Y pp and go further in where there are many ornate metal lamps some of which are",
          "We reached the shrine via a lesser used path directly from Todai-ji Temple and then departed through Deer Park where all the stone lanterns are situated. The first thing you notice is how clean, bright and colorful the shrine complex is. The other distinguishing feature is the",

          "This Shrine contains hundreds if not thousands of lanterns. The path is lined on both sides with stone lanterns that are covered in moss and are stunning in their beauty. Deer roam around and peek out between the huge lanterns. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. You could",

          "We visited Kasuga shrine in the evening, just before the closing time, with no crowd around, and it was truly magical experience! Red shrine buildings were framed with rows of lanterns of different size, shape and color. Plus, wisteria was in bloom! There are also a pitch dark",
          "Many lanterns in this Shrine. Beautiful, the walk is a bit uphill, about 1.5 km walk from the street.",
          "The collection of lanterns on the grounds is awesome. There is also 800-year old wisteria. The walk in is a bit uphill but not strenuous. The lanterns are left to age on their own so they are covered with moss, grass, or worn. Unique in presentation. Lovely in its own",

          "So many lanterns, with deer peeking out between them up to the shrine. However, having waited until later in the day, they offered only goshuin on pre-stamped paper and the additional walking pathways (which did cost money but apparently had nice wisteria) were already closed.",
          "What a beautiful shrine and so well preserved M.D. looked after. It is an absolute must visit when in Nara",
          "After visiting Todai-ji Temple, we went up to Kasuga Grand Shrine. Lots of stone lanterns on both sides of the pathway leading to the Shrine were very impressive. The forest with high trees and the groups of deer were roaming around were targets for photo-taking. If you want",
          "We visited the temple after Todai-ji Temple, it is part of the big Nara Park area. The wide path is lined with many many stone lanterns (Kasuga), quite impressive. Lots of deer roaming around the area, as the forest is on either side. Really nice place to relax and stroll.",
          "If you like Kasugas then this is the spot... many hundreds of them line the route to the temple its very impressive.... well worth a visit",

          "While walk toward the temple, you come across plenty of light stand that guide you to the temple. However, except the red building structure and some lovely lanterns, there are no much to see. I don't event border to pay for entering the temple. Maybe, the temple will be lovely",

          "Kasuga Taisu is a very beautiful temple located near the Nara Park. This temple's interior and exterior design and decorations are wonderful, really worth seeing.",
          "This is a nice walk from the start of the park. It's worth seeing and makes for a great loop. When we went they were maintaining the zen gardens which was nice to see. They give out a cool deer goshuin too.",
          "Great shrine. Walk through the park with surrounding trees and deer wandering around. Need a bit walking and there is some slope though.",
          "Within Nara Park, this Shrine can be walk around within 45 minutes. It offers a glimpse of the shogun history and how religion plays an important part in their way of lives. Worth a visit!",
          "One of the main sites in Nara. Medium sized square Shinto Temple complex to the southeast of Nara Park. There is a museum/carpark nearby from where you can catch a bus back to the station. Of course the colours are spectacular as are all the lanterns hanging in rows. There is",
          "I think i love almost all shinto shrines. The shrine surounded by tall trees, there are vermilion torii and lanterns and everything seems mythical to me. We visit this place in afternoon and sun started to set down and everything so quiet. It just beautiful.",
          "We liked especially the road coming to the shrine, surrounded by beautiful forest and many deers. However, it is sad to see plastic trash by the road and deer tried to bite it. We picked up the trash and had to walk almost 2 km as no trash bin around. Would it be helpful if",
          "This shrine I want to characterize as the Shrine of the Lanterns, which can be found all over. I find that it lacks upkeep, even though you could also say that this way its original character is preserved best.",
          "Peaceful shrine and lovely grounds. The path towards the shrine itself is worth being its own tourist attraction with wild deers along the way.",
          "We commenced our exploration into Nara Park from Kintetsu Nara metro station. We started quite early in the morning but by the time, we reached Kasuga Grand Shrine it was almost late evening and the sky was turning dark. I was attracted by the vermilion columns of the temple",
          "I toured a bit in the area and would make this one of my top two places to see if you were short on time. I didn't see another shrine like it across my many visits to shrines in Nara and in Kyoto because of the huge number of lantern holders that were strewn across the entire",

          "After visiting the humble abode of Shiga Naoya we headed out to Kasuga Taisha. We used a short cut access path that was a bit strange because all you see are towering trees barely penetrated by sunlight. I was only relieved by the end of the trail when I saw the convergence of",

          "A shrine (temple) located in a forrest with hundreds of old stone lanterns an hundreds of very tame deer. One of the best places to visit in Nara. It is worth to take a local bus from Nara railway station and walk the last part of the route through the forest.",
          "It\u2019s a short trek up a small hill to reach the temple. The trek itself is already pretty zen, with all the old stone lanterns along the way. When you get to the temple, there\u2019s a fee to go into the \u201cspecial area\u201d, which we passed because it was raining and we wanted to return",
          "This shrine was well worth visiting as the path winds its way through the forest in Nara Park, with smaller shrines on each side. The path was very busy as locals wandered up the hill to the shrine. After passing through a torii gate you will eventually come to the most",
          "A beautiful shrine to visit while in Nara! I was lucky enough to be going with my host family while staying in Japan who were able to explain some of the processes in the shrine and help us view it respectfully. The first part of the shrine is the middle gate and the hall (the",
          "Kasuga Taisha is worth the detour! In 768 four deities were invited to dwell here and now over 2200 rituals are performed annually. The shrine is unique and beautiful and serene, even with tourists meandering through its walkways adorned by hanging golden lanterns. I loved",

          "Not very impressed, but it was a nice building and the walk towards the shrine had many cool lanterns. Try to walk to the right after you've seen the shrine and you'll see other temples with a whole different feeling, much more calm compared to the hectic Kasuga shrine with all",
          "Just off the park, the shrine is one of the most ancient in Japan. Besides the lanterns this shrine also has very clean restrooms which the overrun Buda Temple lacks. Plan to do your business here.",
          "This Shinto temple is a great addition to the hike to Nigasudo and presents a comparison with this being a Shinto shrine. The entrance cost is well worth getting into the inner pathways of the shrine including a darkened hallway with hundreds of lanterns simulating what it would",
          "It seems like everywhere you turn there is a shrine or temple - and nearly all of them are worth a visit! The Kasuga Grand Shrine is no exception. Definitely make sure this is on your list of shrines to see in Nara!",
          "Kasuga grand shrine is located in Nara area and should be part of your itineraries while in Nara. The temple is very nicely designed and also has quite nice view. The pictures that I attached can clearly explained why.",
          "You need at least 3 hours here to fully explore the surrounding forest. Well worth it. There are plenty of wild deer in the complex and you could easily spend hours just feeding them and getting them to bow.",
          "While the walk up to the temple is beautiful with its path lined with stone lanterns that are actually donations, and the tree cover overhead, it is quite a climb so wear comfortable shoes. If you have knee issues, it's probably better to skip this place and sit at the coffee",
          "I almost skipped this place because too much walking had toll on my feet. Glad I went there. Covered by trees makes it cooler than other places in Nara. The stone lanterns lines up along the pathway. I guess it will be very beautiful in the night when the lanterns are all",
          "Very traditional temple with people in priestess outfits. Aged stone lanterns line the path up to the temple.",
          "When you are in Nara you have to visit this place. Dare I say we thought it was even more beautiful situated than the Todaiji temple....But I think that was mainly because of the surrounding woods which make for a beautiful atmosphere.",

          "Next to Gion and on the way to other Shrines on the main north-south thoroughfare, this shrine sits at the entrance to the enourmous Maruyama Park. Enjoy the scenery!",
          "Honestly, I didn't get to see the shrine because it was raining too hard and we were tired from all the walking. I wanted to visit this because of the lanterns and once I saw the many lanterns along the path, I was just happy taking pictures that I didn't walk all the way up to",
          "What was special for us was seeing a couple being married at the shrine when we arrived--their dress, manner, people accompanying them, and the short ceremony were unique. This shrine has many stone and metal lanterns, many of them gilded. The first visit there were many more",
          "This shrine is pretty easy to access with public transport and provides a wealth of interesting and beautiful buildings and monuments. The gardens are beautiful and the signage and pamphlets provide ample information to make the viewing informative. This is a really beautiful",
          "This shrine is located in Nara Park. It comprises a number of buildings, all painted in the familiar vermillion red colour. When we were there, we saw two weddings and a christening party going into the shrine for a blessing. A must see attraction when in Nara.",
          "It is nice to walk to the Shrine with the quiet greenly surrounding, appreciating the lanterns leading to the shrine and not forgetting the tame wild deer just wondering or lazing around. Love the bright colour of the shrine in the middle of the 'hill'. worth visiting if u are",
          "Kasuga Grand Shrine is a must see. It is spectacular, definitely one the most aesthetically appealing shrines. You can get a glimpse of it from the outside but to tour the interior there is a small fee. The shrine is a bit of an uphill walk from the central part of Nara Park.",
          "Great Shrine in the Nara complex..lovely architecture and beautiful gardens and lanterns.. worth a visit.. little deer wandering around also",
          "it's a nice place but another of the many shrines in Japan, so nothing new. the walk there and back through the park is a nice one",
          "Initially greeted with a walk amongst hundreds of stone lanterns along with deer roaming through them. The stone zen garden led to the main Shrine. We were unable to enter due to a ceremony in progress but were allowed to walk around the outside. This shrine is very well kept",
          "Kasuga Grand Shrine is beside Todaiji temple a symbol of Nara, and one of the highlights in this city. It is also on the list of world cultural heritage. Actually deers in Nara Park belong to this shrine, and they are considered as servants of the god.",
          "The main shrine was closed for private ceremony. We got a glimpse of the outdoor setting that looked like a scene in an old japanese era. We had a stroll in the garden, lots of shades, this would have been a good stop for summer visit.",
          "Honestly after visiting so many shrines in Japan they all started to look similar to me but this one is the best. Deer rule this shrine and it's awesome. It seems like all the deer on the vast land of the shrine have become habituated to human contact and are very friendly and",
          "A Shinto shrine in Nara with hundreds of stone and hanging lanterns. Note some of the lanterns are in disrepair as the deer seem to enjoy eating the paper on the lanterns. A UNESCO site.",

Because is it located in near proximity to the Deer Park, you can find many deer roaming around",

          "It takes about 10 mins walk from the bus stop to reach the shrine. It is a nice peaceful route towards the shrine. Do come early if you don't want to see too many people. We paid for the entrance and it was well worth the money. The shrine is so tranquil and peaceful. It is",
          "My wife and I stopped here as part of a long day touring Kyoto and Nara. We thought that the gate was interesting and there were many lanterns lining the paths. At the time of our visit the paths were shady and cool. The shrine itself was a basic structure. There was a charge",

          "We love Japanese lanterns and this was our favourite shrine/temple during our 15 days in Japan. Simply amazing with unbelievable photo opportunities. A must do as a part of a visit to Nara Park",

          "Kasuga Shrine is located within a forest and has a very tranquil, serene feeling. The entrance is lined with moss-covered stone lanterns with a few deer peeking out between the lanterns. The deer appear to be more docile than the ones at nearby Todai-Ji Temple, mainly because",
          "The shrine itself is average, not worth paying the fee to enter. The sight of the lanterns is impressive though. The star of this attraction is the peaceful and scenic walk to the temple. But be prepared to do some walking and hiking though.",

          "Every year in February and August, I would visit this shrine with my friends when the lanterns were lit, along with some of the regular services in the evening (they also have them in the morning, and host about 950 festivals every year.) These lanterns were given by",
          "Lanterns inside, lanterns outside, a sacred grove (not open for walking) in which hunting and logging have been forbidden since the 9th century. Cloisters on both sides. Needless to say, in pristine condition for the last 1200+ years.",
          "It all starts well with a nice approach with the stone lanterns or up hill through the forest (depends on your approach) and you feel how this could be really cool when the lanterns are all lighted. Then you get close to the shrine and it all turns into a tourist trap. It is",

          "The grounds around the shrine with thousands of stone lanterns all covered in moss and deer roaming about was amazing to see. It was quite busy but some of the network of paths around were quieter than others. I'm not sure if it was the time of year we went or if it always",

          "I very much enjoyed my walk through the park and along the lanterns to get to the shrine. It's a very peaceful area, despite the large crowds - it didn't feel particularly crowded anywhere. Inside (payment required) was quite lovely and people were being let in in small",

          "Much of the shrine was under construction for refurbishing when we were there, but it was still a nice, quick walk. Honestly, it blends in a lot with a lot of the other shrines and temples in Kyoto, but the lanterns are worth seeing. I think it would probably be pretty at",

          "This is a lovely shrine but there is much construction activity. There is a lovely pathway lined with donated lanterns that are lit during festivals. The first shrine on this property was built in the first century so there is a lot of history here.",
          "After seeing grand Todaiji temple this shrine seems less exciting. It's still nice but doesn't come across worth the while. Lanterns are the only interesting part of this shrine but one can not see the full beauty of them in the middle of the day. Lots of walking to do to see",
          "There didn't seem to be much to see here. There were some high profile people visiting, so I think parts of the shrine might have been cordoned off for them. I'm not sure. The lanterns were interesting to look at. I enjoyed the time spent there, but was not blown away as I",
          "This large shrine was a \"relatively\" short walk from Todaiji Temple. The path is flanked by stone lanterns and of course, the ever present deer. There are a few steps up to the shine but well worth the climb through the large Tori Gate. Many people just go to the entrance",

          "We entered most of the temples in Nara. They were all worth going into. This one is much more limited in terms of what to see inside. However, the big attraction here are the two access paths leading up the hill to the shrine - both paths bordered with stone lanterns on pillars",

          "The Kasuga Shrine is a Shinto shrine line with stone lanterns and further up, bronze lanterns. The walk itself is like a walk in a peaceful forest with these interesting stone lanterns on both sides. I must say it can be eerie at times as they remind me of tombstones sometimes,",

Upon entry, there is the pond garden.",

          "We liked this better than the next door Isuien Garden and it was free with foreign ID. One of these gardens would be enogh in my opinion and I would chosse this one.",
          "If you want to take a break from the hustle and buatle of people in Nara Park, then I would recommend this place. A small but peaceful and pretty garden to walk around or just take a load off. Also it is free for non Japanese visitors.",
          "This garden is not a large one but it's definitely very pretty and calm. As all japanese gardens it's very well kept. You may find toilets there too, even if not the cleanest at least for japanese standard.",
          "This is a lovely garden and beautifully kept. Infact there are three distinct gardens within it, i.e. the Japanese styled garden with a pond and a small observation hill overlooking it, a serene moss garden and lastly a flower garden at the back. We took an early bus from",
          "We stumbled upon this garden and the free price tag was a warm welcome after a morning of digging into pockets to pay around Nara. This is a beautiful garden, it was peaceful and quiet. Such care and attention to detail.",
          "Indeed, as described on one of the website, it's a fine garden. The whole place is very well maintained and taken care of. Of course, you can see much now, except all greens. But it is recommended to visit during November where you can see spectacular maple trees!",
          "We visited this because it is free for foreigners, otherwise I don't think it would be worth paying for it. Nice garden, but nothing spectacular. If you have to pay, go right next door to see an amazing garden",
          "Even during the Golden Week holiday we could escape the crowds. May really is a spectacular time - so green! And before the heat sets in. Free entry for foreigners makes this a great option. Just as nice as the more famous Isuien next door.",
          "Free visit of these gardens for oversea tourist. Garden is beautiful and quiet even if it is 5 minutes walk from the big Buddha.",
          "From the gentle and informative welcome to the abundance of wonderful flowers this small garden is testament to someone's aesthetic sensibilities. It needs time and gentle strolling. Everywhere there is beauty in the tiniest stone or fragment of moss. Please don't miss it and",
          "Even though Winter, with no flowers or foliage, this garden is lovely with moss and water features. A couple of small huts added to the timelessness. Tranquil just to stroll along the paths in the misty rain.",
          "We stumbled across this while we were heading elsewhere. When we saw that it was free for foreigners (like us Aussies) we knew there was no reason not to stop and have a look. Fantastic walking path that flowed through the gardens, with photo opportunities at every turn. Set",
          "Although we visited this garden in winter, it's still a very worthwhile garden to visit. The moss gardens are beautiful and it's easy to walk around. We took a taxi from JR Nara, \u00a51040. Very handy to Nara Park and all it's attractions. Free entrance for foreigners.",
          "This garden's autumnal beauty was on show when we visited in November. We were so very impressed. The thought, design and labour that had gone into it, is a credit to those involved. The different 'rooms' are delightful. It is well presented and a must, if you like gardens and",
          "This amazing garden is a hidden treasure in Nara it is next to the Isui-en garden but they are 2 separate gardens.Both are situated near Nara park.Make sure you take your passport as the entry is free for foreign visitors. You walk through the entrance into an amazing pool",
          "This garden is immediately next door to Isui-en garden (a magnificent traditional Japanese garden). They are both worth visiting if you are in the area. Yoshikien is much smaller but offers a moss garden, pond garden and garden of tea ceremony flowers.",
          "Small pretty garden. Not stunning but worth a short visit en route to temples as free for non Japanese. Right next door to isui-en garden which looked beautiful but is expensive at 900y but means you can peek through the mesh fence for nothing!",
          "Yoshikien is a small and beautiful garden with its entrance just to the right of Isuien garden (also worth visiting, much bigger and a fee). With your identity card or passport you will get free entry as a foreigner. It is a serene and beautiful garden that you should not miss",
          "This is right next to Isuien garden and has three sections to stroll in. Foreigners are free of charge. It's extremely pretty with lovely water features and a nice moss garden. The walk is a loop, so it's easy to spend 45 minutes here exploring. There are some rocky steps so",
          "Very nice garden next to Isuein. It's free for foreigners and is worth the twenty minutes to wander around. Much quieter and less busy than its neighbor, and it has three different sections. Would recommend a visit to both, start with this one though.",
          "This garden is fairly small but nice and pretty and peaceful. It's free to visit if you're foreign so worth a look in. There is a pond section, mossy section and flower section.",
          "Very nice garden! Free admission if you are from another country. The gardens and houses were really nice to see. The last garden didn't have any blooms but she let us know that and it was in August. The moss garden was nice. For something free it was great and somewhere you",
          "Free for foreigners, beautiful moss garden! Right next to isuien garden. For me, this garden was cozier, quieter and more peaceful. Go in!",
          "If I gave a five star rating to Isuien Garden, then this one only deserves 4 stars. For most people it is probably not worth visiting both gardens, especially if you are dragging nagging children along with you, and this one is unquestionably the less expensive of the two.",
          "After a very warm welcome by a friendly lady, speaking fluent English (not too common in Japan ) we spent a wonderful time in this beautiful garden. It's better kept than it's neighbor and has lots of places to sit down and calmly enjoy. After all, that's what gardens are",
          "Saw many butterflies spiders and lizards and were able to get many great shots. Free for tourists with passport and English speaking front desk.",
          "This garden is a bit hidden off the main road. However, it is a nice and quite place. The garden is very beautiful. The entrance is free for foreigners.",
          "Free to foreigners, this garden is absolutely lovely. It was not busy at all when we went. We saw, maybe 4 other people there. A very nice place to relax and take your time. I didn't visit the garden next door, but this one was amazing. There was no need to go to the other",
          "Nice alternative to isuien because it's free to foreigners instead of 900 yen. From what I can tell very similar although smaller. Don't think it would be necessary to go to both. Go here on your way to todai.",
          "It is a beautiful garden, especially the part with pond and the moss garden. Nicely shaped, beautiful colours of green, and for free for foreign tourists. So, definitely recommend to visit - it is for 20 minutes, but worth it.",
          "The garden entry is free for foreign tourists. There are 3 main gardens and all are beautiful, perhaps not as manicured as the Isui-en garden next door. Lovely place to sit in peace and enjoy the beauty of nature.",
          "There were three separate parts to this garden - the pond garden, moss garden, and flower garden. Every turn in the path revealed a new and tranquil scene. The sound of water was always there as well. Also, it was free to foreigners - a first for us.",
          "I'm not too good on planning trips so this was a wonderful surprise on the walk to the Todaiji temple. The garden has numerous stone paths, a pavilion and a beautiful teahouse. It was gorgeous even in the rain. top tip: take insect repellent. There are mosquitoes and a sign",
          "This free to tourists (show passport) moss garden with a traditional tea house and ponds is situated to one side of Nara Park and next to the more elaborate pay to enter Isuien garden. We spent a quiet half hour here on our bicycle ride around Nara Park \u2013 it is well laid out",
          "Next door to the more frequented Isuien garden (900\u00a5 entrance fee), this garden is smaller but well worth a visit : split in 3 gardens, the Pond, Moss and Tea gardens, the nicest may be the first one. During my visit early June, the monsoon rain had not yet arrived which may be",
          "perhaps not very spectectular, this is a nice garden worth a visit (and free for foreigners) - we found the moss garden very interesting- didn't even know such thing exists",
          "Yoshikien Garden is located very near Nara Park, Isuien Garden, and Todaiji. The free entry for foreigners attracted my attention. It is a quiet and quaint garden compared to Isuien next door, but it still offers enough lush greenery and flowers to provide a sense of tranquility",
          "Stopped by this lovely garden and it was one of the best we saw in Japan. Free for international guests. Great landscape design and a beautiful tea house. Skip the garden next door that requires a payment and check this out instead. Totally worth it.",
          "I walked by this place after leaving Isuien right next door and being slightly disappointed (it was an overcast afternoon on a winter day), and saw a sign that said \"free to foreigners\". I had some time to kill and thought, why not? It was a nice surprise. I took many pictures",
          "beautiful garden with less visitors to find some peace in the humble jumble or Nara. I can highly recommend to take a rest here and enjoy the traditional living house and beautiful garden beside its big and expensive brother. This is maybe the only place where you will find",
          "Such a warm welcome from a lovely old lady and as we are international visitors we got to visit for free. Those are the positives! Unless you are bored and in desperation of something to pass time I would give this place a miss. Very poorly maintained its like visiting an",
          "Recently on a trip to Nara my parents and I had a few hours to do some sightseeing. Yoshikien wasn't on our list to see, but as the next door neighbors were taking the day off, and as it was free to international visitors, we popped in. Let me preface this by saying we also",
          "It's amazing how the other tourists always skip the gardens. There were so many people at Tennoji, we just expected the gardens to be a madhouse also. The place is so serene and has a lot of history. These gardens are hundreds of years old and immaculately maintained.",
          "We were on our way to Isuien and came across this garden located just right next door. When we saw a sign that says free admission for foreign tourists, we decided to give it a go. To our surprise, the garden far exceeded our expectation. It was really quiet and peaceful with",
          "Located just next door to Isuien Gardens, entrance is free to foreign visitors. While not very large, it does offer three pretty gardens - the pond garden, the moss garden and flower garden. There were only a few other visitors when we were there, so it was nice to be able to",
          "Is a lovely garden with free entrance for foreigners . A place to be surrounded with the feel of fall. Walking distance from my stay from ryokan Mitsumae. Next to this beautiful garden is isuien garden,",
          "This garden is right next to Isuien garden. Entrance is free for foreigners. There were no other people when we went here so it was very quiet and peaceful. Autumn colors are beautiful.",

        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 359,666 and a population density of 1,300 persons per km2. There were 160,242 households residing in Nara. The highest concentration of both households and population, respectively about 46,000 and 125,000, is found along the newer bedtown districts, along the Kintetsu line connecting to Osaka.\nThere were about 3,000 registered foreigners in the city, of which Koreans and Chinese are the two largest groups with about 1,200 and 800 people respectively.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== Buddhist temples ===\nT\u014ddai-ji, including Nigatsu-d\u014d and Sh\u014ds\u014din\nSaidai-ji\nK\u014dfuku-ji\nGang\u014d-ji\nYakushi-ji\nT\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji\nShin-Yakushi-ji\nAkishino-dera\nByakug\u014d-ji\nDaian-ji\nEnj\u014d-ji\nEnsh\u014d-ji\nFutai-ji\nHannya-ji\nHokke-ji\nKik\u014d-ji\nRy\u014dsen-ji\nSh\u014dryaku-ji\n\n\n=== Shinto shrines ===\n\nHimuro Shrine\nKasuga Shrine\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine\n\n\n=== Former imperial palace ===\nHeij\u014d Palace\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNara National Museum\nNara Municipal Buried Cultural Properties Research Centre\nNara City Historical Materials Preservation House\nNara Prefectural Museum of Art\nIrie Taikichi Memorial Museum of Photography Nara City\nNakano Museum of Art\nNeiraku Museum\nSh\u014dhaku Art Museum\nYamato Bunkakan\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nFormer Daij\u014d-in Gardens (\u65e7\u5927\u4e57\u9662\u5ead\u5712)\nIsuien Garden\nKy\u016bseki Teien\nManyo Botanical Garden, Nara\nYoshiki-en\nYagy\u016b Iris Garden, Nara (\u67f3\u751f\u82b1\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3076\u5712)\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNaramachi\nNara Park\nNara Hotel\nNara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties\nYagy\u016b\nZut\u014d (\u982d\u5854)\nNara Dreamland\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nNara Marathon\nNara Centennial Hall\nNara Kasugano International Forum Iraka\nShuni-eGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Deer in Nara ==\nAccording to the legendary history of Kasuga Shrine, the god Takemikazuchi arrived in Nara on a white deer to guard the newly built capital of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d. Since then, the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.Tame sika deer (also known as spotted deer or Japanese deer) roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. In 2015, there were more than 1,200 sika deer in Nara. Snack vendors sell sika senbei (deer crackers) to visitors so they can feed the deer. Some deer have learned to bow in order to receive senbei from people.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\nAs of 2005, there are 16 high schools and 6 universities located in the city of Nara.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nNara Women's University is one of only two national women's universities in Japan.

          "This is a really ancient temple dating back to the seventh century and located a short walk from both Nara Park and Kintetsu Nara train station. There are several large halls and at least three pagodas including the very old five storied pagoda that was rebuilt in the 15th",

          "I am an aficionado of Buddhist shrines, and the Eastern Golden Hall is one of the most stunning I have seen anywhere in the world. The rest of the complex is all right, although one main temple is closed and under renovation. Also, we were not big fans of the hundreds of hungry",

          "We did this as part of our all day tour through Nara from Kyoto. The Octagonal Hall and the Five Story Pagoda were some of the unique structures for this temple. There is an entrance fee, also for additional museum exhibits as well, but we found the display quite interesting",
          "Interesting lay out and buildings, a bit different to others, well visited but not as crowded as some,",
          "Nice temple complex with a main hall and few pagodas. You can spend up close watching those Buddha statues and the marvelous craftsmanship. Do not just stop visiting the main hall. Pay additional entrance to tour the museum. One attraction is a a three headed Buddha status.",
          "As i walked from Nara Station, i will come to the foot of a flight of steps which leads up to the temple. Although not as impressive as Todaiji Temple, this is still worth a short visit. You can walk through this temple to reach Nara park. That is, you don't have to come back",
          "Nice temple. Entrance fee is needed to visit the interior. A walk surrounding is very nice. Shopping street nearby is where you can find snacks and food.",
          "You can see a lot of construction going on in various temples and tourist attractions of japan to prepare for the Tokyo 2020 olympics. After seeing so many temples, one can be numb to the sight yet I still find it a humbling experience. A nice detour to the deer park and not as",

          "This is one of the temples that I was least impressed with but there are many people who come to pray. We went to this temple as a detour on our way to the train station which is what most people do. It's more of a scenic route to the train station.",

          "This is a beautiful temple, but the true highlight of the temple is the Pagoda. The Pagoda simply towers over you and knowing about the history of it makes it an even better experience. However, if you are rushing for time you can skip Kofukuji temple, as besides taking some",
          "The main hall is under renovation for a few more years, but the buildings here are still worth seeing. The best part though is the (paid, but cheap) museum housing many statues and carvings, especially the main statue in the middle that was spared the anti-Buddhist movement in",
          "Of interest at this temple are the five-storey, and three-storey pagodas. There are also two octagonal shries which are of interest. You can visit the temple 24-7 free of charge, unless you want to visit the \"golden\" building, and the museum in the temple ground.",
          "Large historic temple complex in Nara. Free to wander about outside, and see the tall pagoda. Very grand and impressive buildings. We didn't go into any of the paid areas to see the artefacts. Free and interesting historic site to wander round. As a temple it is nothing",

          "The thing that would tie the complex together and give it cohesion is, unfortunately, going to be unavailable for years to come. It is still a more than worthwhile visit though. The great Eastern Hall and Five Story Pagoda are pretty much the highlights now; I highly recommend",

          "While walking to the Todaiji temple, this temple was on the way so we checked it out- it was just okay. There were a lot of deer around so it was interesting as well. I think in Nara, the Todaiji temple deserves more of your time than the other little ones- I think you could",

        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 359,666 and a population density of 1,300 persons per km2. There were 160,242 households residing in Nara. The highest concentration of both households and population, respectively about 46,000 and 125,000, is found along the newer bedtown districts, along the Kintetsu line connecting to Osaka.\nThere were about 3,000 registered foreigners in the city, of which Koreans and Chinese are the two largest groups with about 1,200 and 800 people respectively.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== Buddhist temples ===\nT\u014ddai-ji, including Nigatsu-d\u014d and Sh\u014ds\u014din\nSaidai-ji\nK\u014dfuku-ji\nGang\u014d-ji\nYakushi-ji\nT\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji\nShin-Yakushi-ji\nAkishino-dera\nByakug\u014d-ji\nDaian-ji\nEnj\u014d-ji\nEnsh\u014d-ji\nFutai-ji\nHannya-ji\nHokke-ji\nKik\u014d-ji\nRy\u014dsen-ji\nSh\u014dryaku-ji\n\n\n=== Shinto shrines ===\n\nHimuro Shrine\nKasuga Shrine\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine\n\n\n=== Former imperial palace ===\nHeij\u014d Palace\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNara National Museum\nNara Municipal Buried Cultural Properties Research Centre\nNara City Historical Materials Preservation House\nNara Prefectural Museum of Art\nIrie Taikichi Memorial Museum of Photography Nara City\nNakano Museum of Art\nNeiraku Museum\nSh\u014dhaku Art Museum\nYamato Bunkakan\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nFormer Daij\u014d-in Gardens (\u65e7\u5927\u4e57\u9662\u5ead\u5712)\nIsuien Garden\nKy\u016bseki Teien\nManyo Botanical Garden, Nara\nYoshiki-en\nYagy\u016b Iris Garden, Nara (\u67f3\u751f\u82b1\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3076\u5712)\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNaramachi\nNara Park\nNara Hotel\nNara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties\nYagy\u016b\nZut\u014d (\u982d\u5854)\nNara Dreamland\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nNara Marathon\nNara Centennial Hall\nNara Kasugano International Forum Iraka\nShuni-eGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Deer in Nara ==\nAccording to the legendary history of Kasuga Shrine, the god Takemikazuchi arrived in Nara on a white deer to guard the newly built capital of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d. Since then, the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.Tame sika deer (also known as spotted deer or Japanese deer) roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. In 2015, there were more than 1,200 sika deer in Nara. Snack vendors sell sika senbei (deer crackers) to visitors so they can feed the deer. Some deer have learned to bow in order to receive senbei from people.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\nAs of 2005, there are 16 high schools and 6 universities located in the city of Nara.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nNara Women's University is one of only two national women's universities in Japan.

        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 359,666 and a population density of 1,300 persons per km2. There were 160,242 households residing in Nara. The highest concentration of both households and population, respectively about 46,000 and 125,000, is found along the newer bedtown districts, along the Kintetsu line connecting to Osaka.\nThere were about 3,000 registered foreigners in the city, of which Koreans and Chinese are the two largest groups with about 1,200 and 800 people respectively.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== Buddhist temples ===\nT\u014ddai-ji, including Nigatsu-d\u014d and Sh\u014ds\u014din\nSaidai-ji\nK\u014dfuku-ji\nGang\u014d-ji\nYakushi-ji\nT\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji\nShin-Yakushi-ji\nAkishino-dera\nByakug\u014d-ji\nDaian-ji\nEnj\u014d-ji\nEnsh\u014d-ji\nFutai-ji\nHannya-ji\nHokke-ji\nKik\u014d-ji\nRy\u014dsen-ji\nSh\u014dryaku-ji\n\n\n=== Shinto shrines ===\n\nHimuro Shrine\nKasuga Shrine\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine\n\n\n=== Former imperial palace ===\nHeij\u014d Palace\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNara National Museum\nNara Municipal Buried Cultural Properties Research Centre\nNara City Historical Materials Preservation House\nNara Prefectural Museum of Art\nIrie Taikichi Memorial Museum of Photography Nara City\nNakano Museum of Art\nNeiraku Museum\nSh\u014dhaku Art Museum\nYamato Bunkakan\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nFormer Daij\u014d-in Gardens (\u65e7\u5927\u4e57\u9662\u5ead\u5712)\nIsuien Garden\nKy\u016bseki Teien\nManyo Botanical Garden, Nara\nYoshiki-en\nYagy\u016b Iris Garden, Nara (\u67f3\u751f\u82b1\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3076\u5712)\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNaramachi\nNara Park\nNara Hotel\nNara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties\nYagy\u016b\nZut\u014d (\u982d\u5854)\nNara Dreamland\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nNara Marathon\nNara Centennial Hall\nNara Kasugano International Forum Iraka\nShuni-eGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Deer in Nara ==\nAccording to the legendary history of Kasuga Shrine, the god Takemikazuchi arrived in Nara on a white deer to guard the newly built capital of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d. Since then, the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.Tame sika deer (also known as spotted deer or Japanese deer) roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. In 2015, there were more than 1,200 sika deer in Nara. Snack vendors sell sika senbei (deer crackers) to visitors so they can feed the deer. Some deer have learned to bow in order to receive senbei from people.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\nAs of 2005, there are 16 high schools and 6 universities located in the city of Nara.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nNara Women's University is one of only two national women's universities in Japan.

The Sengoku daimy\u014d Tsutsui Junkei started construction of the castle, and Toyotomi Hidenaga made it his residence. In the Edo period, it became the headquarters of the K\u014driyama Domain. During this time it was held by members of the Mizuno, Okudaira Matsudaira, Honda, Fujii Matsudaira, and Yanagisawa clans.\nToday, many walls and moats are preserved in a public park in the city. The Yanagisawa Shrine stands on the grounds. The Castle was listed as one of\u3000the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.\n\n\n== Photographs ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe nearest station is Kintetsu-K\u014driyama.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThis article incorporates material from the articles \u90e1\u5c71\u57ce (\u5927\u548c\u56fd) (K\u014driyama-j\u014d (Yamato no Kuni)) and \u90e1\u5c71\u85e9 (K\u014driyama-han) in the Japanese Wikipedia, retrieved on May 4, 2008.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Akishino-dera (\u79cb\u7be0\u5bfa) is a Buddhist temple in Nara, Japan. Founded in the eighth century, its Kamakura-period Hond\u014d is a National Treasure.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Shoku Nihongi of 797 places the origins of the temple in H\u014dki 11 (780), while the Legends of Akishino-dera (\u79cb\u7be0\u5bfa\u7e01\u8d77) of 1139 ascribes it to the vows of Emperor K\u014dnin and Emperor Kammu and names its founder as Zenj\u016b Daitoku (\u5584\u73e0\u5927\u5fb3), younger brother of Emperor Sh\u014dmu. The Records of the K\u014dfuku-ji Kanmu (\u8f3f\u798f\u5bfa\u5b98\u52d9\u7252\u758f) of 1441 dates its foundation instead to 776. Excavated Nara-period tiles corroborate an eighth-century foundation date. Like other major temples of the period, Akishino-dera had two pagodas, as well as a Kond\u014d. According to the Legends, a fire in June 1135 destroyed most of the temple. Two hundred and fifty-five ofuda, dating from 1327 to 1524, cast light on later years.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe five by four bay National Treasure Hond\u014d, with a raised platform, earthen floor, tiled hipped roof, and slightly narrower intercolumniation at each end, epitomises the Way\u014d style. Built on the site of the former lecture hall, it is a Kamakura-period rebuild in somewhat archaizing style. Inside, a raised altar platform is backed by an internal wall that spans three bays.

        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 359,666 and a population density of 1,300 persons per km2.

Since then, the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.Tame sika deer (also known as spotted deer or Japanese deer) roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. In 2015, there were more than 1,200 sika deer in Nara. Snack vendors sell sika senbei (deer crackers) to visitors so they can feed the deer. Some deer have learned to bow in order to receive senbei from people.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\nAs of 2005, there are 16 high schools and 6 universities located in the city of Nara.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nNara Women's University is one of only two national women's universities in Japan.

          "A large garden, as Japanese gardens go, and divided into an \"outer\" and \"inner\" side. The garden and associated tea ceremony huts have been popular with Urasenke masters, and rich merchants entertaining artists of the day. I found it rather generic, definitely not worth the",
          "Situated between World Heritage sites of Kofukuji Temple and Todaiji Temple in Nara Park is a typical Japanese garden. During an extensive trip where you'll be visiting the gardens in Kanazawa, Okayama and various castle grounds, Isuien is not a necessary garden to see. It is of",
          "Wonderful garden, secluded with different zones, better than some of the paying gardens we visited. The mosses are wonderful, and so were the momiji.",
          "This garden is situated between Kofukuji Temple and Todaiji Temple (both are World Heritages) In Nara Prefecture. This garden has chactereistics of two different types of gardens in Edo Era and the Meiji Era. This garden represents a typical Japanese garden.The garden is a",
          "This is a beautiful garden. It encapsulates much of what is important in Japanese garden design. Please do not miss it. Well worth a visit.",
          "It's a small garden but has some nice views. Also, next to their entrance gate, on the right, is another garden which you can enter freely when you show your passport. visit them both and you have a nice 1,5 hour.",
          "I used to go to Nara when I was on business trips to Japan. The city is great to escape the full-on insanity of Osaka, and this garden was my favourite place to come to. Returning as a tourist confirmed that my memories were not faulty. This is a truly special place. Every view",
          "Beautiful, tranquil gardens. A great window into the Japanese world. Totally great way to spend an hour or two.",
          "This garden lived up to its expectations. A nice break from the crowds at the big Buddha temple. There are friendly docents that give history. We spent 1 hour taking pictures and walking the stone and dirt paths, over small bridges and stone paths that cross the scenic",
          "We went to the garden and thought the prices was a little steep. Went to museum that was included and that was nice. As we entered the park a lady said goodbye to a gang and then introduced herself to us as our guide. She was knowledgeable and it was just only us on the tour. No",
          "We were passing it and decided to go in but there is an entrance fee. not many people go to see the garden at least when we were there in July. It is beautiful but again if we were not in area.. it is not worth a special trip",
          "Budget travelers beware! You may have to shell out a little more than you're comfortable with for this attraction, but I honestly believe you won't regret it. If you're especially interested in scenery, fantastic views and gardens then there's no way you'll regret coming here.",
          "Like many Japanese gardens, this one is full of beautiful views and it\u2019s quite big. We had a lovely experience because we were shown the place with a private guide (it was included with our ticket and there was nobody else visiting that day at that time). He explained to us the",
          "There are actually two gardens here one in the back and one in the front. Each represents a different style. We went in May 2019 and there was a \u00a5900 entrance fee. It takes about 1 hour to power through the gardens. The museums is relatively small, so you can skip it to save",
          "What a beautiful garden this is and well worth the admission fee. We were lucky to have an excellent guide to tell us the history of the garden.",
          "The garden is a nice break from the crowds and offers free English speaking guides. It is not a big garden but offers some very pretty photo spots and is well worth a look if you are in the area.",
          "After we saw another Japanese style gardens in Japan I think that this place is nice to visit but definitely not worth a 900 yen that included the fee for the museum(that you have to pay even if you don\u2019t want to enter). I think Yoshiki-en garden(a few minutes walking) is nice",
          "After the crowds in the park, including multiple school tours, this garden offered a welcome respite.",
          "We visited this garden on April 9. It is next to the Yoshiki-en garden. With the ticket you can visit the little art museum next to the ticket office. The garden has two parts: the front garden is compact and the back garden has a big pound, some cascades and little quiet places.",
          "Isuien Garden is a beautiful traditional Japanese garden, tucked into a quiet corner of Nara\u2019s streets. The entrance booth is manned by a polite old lady who spoke English and told us that it was free for tourists, which was a pleasant surprise as we were already getting ready",
          "We were disappointed by the size and amount of fauna. Maybe it was the time of year. Don\u2019t spend the 900 yen. It only takes 10 min to walk slowly around.",
          "A pretty Japanese garden with tea houses. Some peace from the nearby crowds. The museum is also worth a look.",
          "This was a lovely garden but I felt the Yoshikien garden, which is right next door, was more beautiful and better for a photographer. If you are pushed for time - seeing the Yoshikien garden is definitely the one to choose. Nonetheless we thoroughly enjoyed walking around this",
          "This garden is a calmed oasis near Nara Park. The place has a museum, several tea houses and a beautiful garden.",
          "If you like Japanese landscape gardens with occasional views of nearby temples and the hills around Nara come here.",
          "It is certainly a lovely garden. But having been to many other gardens in Japan, I am not quite sure if its really that special and if it deserves to be quite pricier to visit than most other gardens in Japan. Still, worth visiting if you like gardens, and it doesnt get very",
          "Almost impossible to find..but when we eventually did it was worth the struggle. A beautiful peaceful place to while away a morning. Plenty of areas where you can just sit and contemplate. You should take id with you if you're planning a visit.otheewise you can't go in!",
          "beautiful garden! one of many nearby! we highly recommend going there a little earlier when there are not so many tourists! the opportunity to take beautiful photos! admirable how beautiful it is all there preserved",
          "Lovely gardens however at 900 yen it is one of the most expensive sites I visited on my whole trip. Peaceful setting and nice views. Just hard to justify the cost.",
          "It was an adequate garden, though nothing was in full bloom at the time of visit. I have definitely seen better. For such a small garden, it was pretty overpriced at 900 yen. I mean, even the entrance to Todai-ji was 600 yen only! Student discount is very small, you still have",
          "Manicured garden with attention to even the leaves that felt. I would cover the pipe that probably creates the small creek on the top, just not to break the illusion, but overall te place is just pretty in steroids.",
          "A typical but stunning Japanese Garden with wonderful views of the mountain. Small and compact, quick and easy to visit.",
          "This garden is slightly off the beaten track (from JR Nara to Todaiji). However, do note that the admission is rather expensive at \u00a5900. The garden is well maintained and beautiful, giving you a typical Japanese Zen feeling. Be sure to spend some time here during your trip to",
          "We paid 800 yen or so to enter these private gardens. We took advantage of the volunteer English guide who explained a bit about the gardens. Her English was not too advanced to answer detailed questions though. The gardens are a must see and do. A definite tranquil escape from",
          "My initial response to the entry price was that it was too expensive but with the personal guide it really was a great experience. Despite it being Winter I still saw many features. The guide pointed out many things that I would have walked past. it was an enriching experience.",
          "Very beautiful garden in every season! Even in winter, it offered us some charming views. Besides, there is an atmospheric tea house with traditional desserts and matcha) Besides, Yoshikien garden is just a few steps away, and it\u2019s free for foreign visitors!",
          "The Isuien garden is stunning and a nice peaceful break from the crowds in Nara Park. We were given a small guided tour where we were told about the history of the garden and Japanese tea ceremony. Our guide was lovely and very informative.",
          "This was the first Stop in lonely planets walking tour and we are so glad we decided to do it. For 900yen we got a wonderful little tour and explanation of the Japanese garden style, the Isuien\u2019s unique details and the general Japanese tea ceremony. We then wandered the tranquil",
          "We visited the Garden after visiting the Deer Park. A walkable distance from the park (via the underpass). We paid \u00a5900 per adult for the entrance fee which included a free ticket to a small pottery museum next to the Garden. It was a beautiful Japanese garden with many photo",
          "I tripped on this and am glad I did. Really nicely laid out and i was lucky to have some fall colors. It isn't large so you're not rushed going through it. A small museum which i did not go in. the gardens took up what allocated time i had.",
          "Family initially didn't want to pay the entrance fee of 900 yen, but came out feeling that this was one of the highlights in Nara. The concept of 'borrowing scenery' is in full display in the Garden. I think I enjoyed it more than the Nara deers, for the autumn colours.",
          "On our arrival at the Isuien Garden we were approached by a delightful older man, Hiroyuki, who offered to take us on a tour of the garden. He is retired from work, and provides his services as a volunteer. His tour was informative and gave us a perspective of the garden and",
          "We loved this garden. It is beautiful and very calm and relaxing. It was nice to also get entry into the museum.",
          "If you only ever visit one Japanese style garden during your visit to Japan, make it this one. Interesting plants, features, watercourses, tea houses. Yeah, it's got the lot. Very enjoyable!",
          "This is near Nara Park so going here will not take you much time. I am stressed from work and so is my husband so our time here was well spent for meditation and good talk. This is not the best Japanese Garden however still is beautiful. And if you ever wanted a snack, they",
          "I spent several hours enjoying this garden during a recent stay in Nara. The grounds were lovely and very peaceful. The leaves were just beginning to turn, which added to the beauty of the place. I visited soon after it opened and it was not crowded. I also went to the small",
          "Beautiful place, but here's the thing, maybe it's just me. right next door is the smaller Yoshikien gardens. So for me, after a while, that's a lot of garden to see. If I had done one but not the other, I think I would have been fine. Naturally the 2 are not the same. And I am",
          "We visited Isuien shortyl before it closed. It was a rainy day, there were not many people in the garden, probably because the entry fee was on the higher side. Totally worth it tough, the garden is amazing and very well maintained. One of my favourite gardens in Japan.",
          "One of the most beautiful and peaceful gardens I\u2019ve seen after Kyoto... very impressive places to discover. I would highly suggest everyone to enjoy the nature there.. a must see garden in Nara!",
          "The entry fee to this garden is 900 yen. It entitles you to a free guided tour of the garden as well as entry to the museum. Some people might shun away because of the cost of the entry fee, however, I do feel that this place is a must do in Nara. The garden is so beautiful and",
          "I loved these gardens - really peacful and very well kept, it is a bit pricey but they offer free tours of the garden which are done by volunteers who are very well informed about the whole area. If you want somewhere to get social media pictures or family snaps then this place",
          "The gardens were pleasant but much smaller than I was expecting. Also the museum was also small and not very interesting especially for non-Japanese speakers. At \u00a5900, I thought it was very expensive especially compared to the other main sights in Nara.",
          "This is the best park. There is a breathtaking view in the park that I cant stop thinking about. Quiet and not as crowded as the rest of the city. I would really like to come back in spring or fall.",
          "With a reduced rate for foreigners, if you like Japanese gardens this one is better than the neighboring Yoshiki-en garden. It's about half an hour to wander around and enjoy the ambience. There are several tea houses in the gardens and I believe you can book in for a ceremony.",
          "This is a hidden gem, uncrowded, quiet, a must see. Step away from the crowds to this peaceful oasis.",
          "Even on a June Sunday with Todai-ji and the surrounding parks so overrun with crowds the deer had given up hassling for food, Isuien was a peaceful oasis, with barely a sound creeping in from outside, and just a few dozen people strolling the grounds. The gardens here are",
          "Perhaps because it requires an entrance fee, this garden is untarnished by the touristy crowds outside. For the \u00a5900 I was offered a free English guide around the garden which I learnt a lot from about Japanese landscaping and culture. The garden is quintessentially Japanese",
          "Went on a visit to Nara, very peaceful and beautiful. One of my favorite parks in Japan. Not crowded so you could take your time wandering around. Lovely visit",
          "What a lovely garden to sit and relax in total calmness. You can walk round and it is very quiet and serene. There is a tea room where you can get tea or lunch and sit looking out over the garden. The garden covers nearly three acres. There are two strolling around the pond",
          "A friend recommended that we visit Isuien Garden during our visit to Nara. We are glad we did! Such a peaceful garden away from the busy and noisy shrines/ temples. The entrance fee is 900 yen for adults, pricey but I think worth it.",
          "After walking Nara Park and Toda-ji temple the Tea House at the Isuien Garden is a nice break. Nice view , green tea ice cream $520 yen.",
          "The garden was nice but not 900 yen nice. Having been to others on our trip so far for half the price if less it didn't compare yet was more expensive. Real shame. If money is no object please go in as it is very pretty. There is a free garden next door (for foreign",
          "This is an exquisite jewel of a garden. The texture of the land, water and plants is in perfect balance. We were there in the first week in April on a comfortable sunny day \u2013 and it was glorious to walk around this garden - beautiful colors. There is a free garden next door,",
          "This is an exquisite garden which is a traditional Japanese walking garden. The entry fee of 900 yen is good value as this also included a tour of the garden from an expert guide. Probably the best garden that we visited in Japan.",
          "I felt the entrance fee was higher than usual (Yen 900 if I recall correctly) but when I think back about my day in Nara the garden was a big factor in making the whole trip so much more worthwhile. I visited. It is not so popular by name, but google map is helpful to locate it,",
          "Amazing garden. One of the best I have been to in Japan. I went on a rainy day so the setting made for a great experience. The water was so still at times it made a perfect reflection. Just sat there for what seemed like hours.",
          "Another beautiful, well manicured and structured Japane garden and this one free to foreigners. Men were removing fallen petals from the moss. A relaxing stroll in an area of great beauty.",
          "Visited this as park of a trip to Nara. The landscape of the garden is prettt and definitely worth a visit as part of Nara trip.",
          "It is located next to a public garden free for tourist. After visiting the free garden, this garden seems a bit expensive. However, we are very glad that we went there. It is a private Japanese garden with beautiful landscape and is big. Because of the fee, it is rather",
          "There are two different styles of japanese gardens in Nara right next door to each other and both are worth visiting - Isuien was my favourite as there was a lovely lake/river there and varying examples of japanese gardening around it. The sun was out and we found ourselves in",
          "We could see how these gardens would be beautiful in season but we visited in winter and they were dry and brown. On the way out we ran into a man working at the gardens who told us in spring the cherry blossoms are beautiful to see, in summer everything is green and flowering",
          "Very noce little jewel at the foot of the majestuous todai - jo temple. The garden is manicured as well as the tea house and other buildings inside. Really woth the tour!",
          "The Isuien Garden was one of my must visit place in Nara. I visited it in November during the maple color reached its peak, it was so beautiful and peaceful. There were not many visitors probably because the entrance fee is quite expensive (900 yen). There is Yoshikien garden",
          "We made our way from the train station past all the tourists to Isuien Gardens. At the entrance, we were very fortunate to be met by an EGG (Nara YMCA English Goodwill Guide) who offered to guide us through the garden. This turned into one of the highlights of our trip. We had",
          "We visited the garden during winter-time. The main garden was closed but we were allowed into a smaller segment. Foreign visitors get to enter for free. Not the best time to visit a garden during winter but the place still exudes serenity. Quite scenic despite bare trees.",
          "Passby the place while walking towards Nara park , the free entrance entice me to check the place out . Nice place to slowly explore the place within 20mins, not many visitors as it is slightly off the main road to Nara park .",
          "While the Deer Park in Nara boasts the most friendly animals. Isuien Gardens provides a tranquil serenity in a busy city setting. We were fortunate to meet a docent at the entrance who explained the gardens layout, intricacies and meaning. He provided a great background history",
          "If you travel to Nara please don't miss this beautiful garden with it's beautiful colours, streams, stepping stones and ponds with the most amazing reflections. If you can, get one of the garden guides to show you around, they are a mine of information about the garden layout",
          "We were in for some diversity after a string of temples, so we paid to visit the garden, which was advertised with splendid photographs through town. We were not disappointed. If we would have had more time we might have tried the tea ceremony, but the garden with tea houses",
          "I visited under the rain, and it did not lose its enchantment. Don't miss also the next door YOSHIKIEN Garden",
          "The front garden is beautifully landscaped and it gradually becomes less designed as you move through the back garden to the outer edges. The autumn colours of the Acers and Enkianthus were stunning as they were reflected in the ponds. The various tea houses were well",
          "This is a beautiful garden, expertly looked after - we watched the gardening team pruning trees - fascinating to watch how they determine shape etc. Lovely meandering paths and ponds with quite a variety of plants.",
          "Garden was beautiful and quiet. Not many tourists, due to entry fee I guess, so we got to really enjoy our visit. We had one of the free guides, he was funny and spoke very good English. His explanation of all the symbols and the design principles behind the garden made the",
          "This is the most scenic garden we visited in Japan. In November it glows with red leaves of Enkianthus and Japanese Maples. It has dynamic topography on nearly three acres encompassing two ponds, islands, water wheel and waterfall. One can enjoy lunch at the Tea house and stroll",
          "Beautiful and relaxing park for walking and admiring the view over the mountains and the greenery. Calm and pretty. You can also have tea in the tea house in the park.",
          "This garden has all the expected features of a traditional Japanese garden: pond and rills, clipped maples, stepping stones, lanterns and teahouses. It was lovely even in the rain. Watch out for the stones with cord wrapping - they mean no entry! We didn't go in the small",
          "The garden is beautiful and its entrance fee miraculously deters the crowds that would ruin it. It was particularly appreciated as Nara's main sites are overrun by visitors. The museum was dull - specialising in seals, as in company seals, it was not well enough displayed to be",
          "Beautiful traditional japanese garden, in two parts. We were offered a free tour from a volunteer who was practicing his English and it was great to learn from and converse with him.",
          "We did enjoy this garden but somehow it left us a bit flat. We liked the next door, smaller, and more dramatic Yoshikien garden which also was free with foreign ID (passport...) better.",
          "Beautiful garden built around a tea house and of course a few minutes walk from the temple which is the largest wooden structure in the world. We were unfortunate in that it was very cloudy but on a sunny day would be magnificent. Adjacent to it is a small museum which was",
          "big thanks to tsutomu from nara ymca english goodwill tours,met by accident at nara rail station and given a free 5 hour walking tour of nara,visited most of the sights including Isuien Garden, one of the best days i had in japan. would visit again in spring or autumn though,as",
          "We were greeted by a volunteer who gave us a quick 10 min intro to the garden which was great! The whole garden is so pretty and tranquil, i preferred this to some of the bigger more \"commercialised\" gardens we saw in other parts of Japan.",
          "I still cannot believe I paid \u00a5900 to visit this small, mediocre garden, which looks quite neglected. They are certainly not using this high entrance fee for the maintenance of the park. Quite frankly, it would not deserve a visit even if it were a free entrance. Major",
          "Isuien garden is one of the most beautiful example of Japanese gardening art. Entrance fee a little bit higher than usual temple or museum entrance fees, however it is a place which offers to enjoy tea time in a real japanese garden :)",
          "An absolutely beautiful garden, something I would like to see during all four season changes. Lovely piece of history and nurture of the centuries. A must visit spot during your time in Nara. This was my highlight this trip.",
          "We went during Summer and it was so green and beautiful! Free guides are available. It's hard to find. You'll have to walk between a long walkways with a yellow wall and brown wall.",
          "If you're visiting Nara Park you will almost certainly wander through or past Isui-en Garden. It is attractive but would not be worth a special trip itself.",
          "it's a small and lovely garden to walk around, definetly worth paying the small entrance fee. also around great place to enjoy a cup of green tea.",
          "We chose to go to this garden before the deer city and arrived at 10am. The garden entrance was 900yen each and got you entrance to the garden and the museum next door. Arriving at 10 was perfect as we missed all of the tour groups and pretty much walked around with a volenteer",
          "A relatively small and peaceful garden with lots to enjoy - particularly borrowed scenery and ponds. Surprisingly not that busy and highly recommend as a quick and easy visit on the way from train/centre to Todaji. The little museum which is included in ticket is only so/so",
          "My wife and I found this garden to be between ok and nice, certainly not worth the 1200 yen each for entry. Save your money and your legs getting there.",
          "This is a beautiful garden (s) for a peaceful stroll with the mountain in the background. If you are a gardener yourself you will certainly take away many ideas with you. You will find a few welcome moments of peace if you just sit a while and soak it all in.",
          "A beautiful, tranquil zen garden definitely worth a detour for a quiet wander. Lovely moss patchworks.",
          "Both the garden and the museum that comes with the entrance fee were quite disappointing. Having visited a number of Japanese gardens already, Isuien appeared to be somewhat neglected, which detracts from the beautiful landscaping. The Yoshiki-en garden next door was better",
          "We loved strolling through this Japanese garden! So many special zen places! The garden was spectacular in the late spring but I have seen pictures of it in the fall when it is just as remarkable. A must see if you are visiting Nara and very close to Nara Park.",
          "Must say, this was the best surprise of the day. It was raining a little, so we decided to stay for a minute. And it was wonderful. We struck the wooden gong for service and ordered two large beers while our baby crawled across the floor. It was more expensive than other gardens",
          "We visited Isuien Garden in January and it was a cold day but the garden warmed our hearts and we soon forgot how cold the day was as we viewed this amazing example of a Japanese garden. Fortunately because of the time of year there were few people around and we had the whole",
          "It's well organised and full of beautifully trimmed trees and plants. Water, moss, pebbles. It's quintessentially Japanese. Take your time here whatever you do.",
          "round the corner from the Great Buddha we were greeted by a volunteer guide who offered to take us around. this is a borrowed garden with views of the surrounding mountains and temple visible through the trees. pretty ponds and teahouse",
          "A Japanese Garden, really well-maintained. Visit in different seasons to enjoy the different feel, as the foliage changes colors. Relaxing and calm atmosphere.",
          "The garden was one of my favourite gardens that I visited on my trip to Japan. It's only a short walk from the Todai-ji and though relatively small in size, is definitely worth a visit. There is also a small museum opposite the gardens which you can skip if you are short on",
          "One of the most iconic landscape of Japan, this garden represent all the beauty you can find in Japan. It is a must visit if you come to Nara.",
          "The Isuien Garden is about 10 minutes walking distance west of the Nandaimon Gate of the Todai-ji temple and covers nearly 3 acres. The garden is a combination of front garden- built in 1670's by Kiyosumi Dosei and back garden - designed by Seki Tojiro in early 20th century.",
          "We visited this garden 3 years ago and wanted to visit again. BUT, the garden is closed to the public whilst reconstruction is done. Visit Yoshikien next door which is free to foreigners.",
          "It is one of the most beautiful gardens (especially when the leaves turn red) we have seen on out trip, very tranquil. Isuien garden is located West of the Nandaimon Gate of the Todai-ji temple. The front garden is designed in the Edo period and the back garden is designed in",
          "There are reasons why this is classified as one of the country's most beautiful gardens. This private garden can be visited but at cost of 900 yen. In my opinion, it is worth the money. For the few that have rated this a poor attraction, it is apparent that they have missed",
          "It is the most tranquil place we've been on this trip. There aren't a bus load of tourist like in other attractions. You can spend time taking in the sights in the back and front gardens. Its well worth the 900Yen entrance fee",
          "Nice small Japanese garden for couple of hours. The guide explained us about the small buildings or place where tea ceremony is done. This was a private garden earlier now available for public. Many places to take a perfect photo especially during autumn. Good place to visit if",
          "These gardens are well worth the 900 yen to gain entrance. They are tranquil and in the late fall the colours are beautiful. The waterfalls are peaceful. I would skip the museum but the Isuien Garden is a good way to start your visit to Nara.",
          "You imagine a Japanese garden in the fall and then you get lucky and visit Japan during peak fall season. It's a gardener and a photographer's paradise - there's a fabulous photo op at every turn. I know many people come to Japan to see cherry blossoms in the spring but it is",
          "Isuien is a gem of a garden. Every which way you turn, there is something beautiful and interesting to see. The garden is wonderfully sculpted, and the autumn colours are stunning. We had a photograph of a whole backdrop of red maple leaves. The garden path is well-marked, with",
          "Two minutes after deciding not to pay $18 for two of us to view another garden, we found Isuien-free to International tourists. It was absolutely stunning. The flowers were not in bloom up in the floral garden, but we were there in peak leaf changing season in a bit of rain in",
          "We went to Japan for the autumn leaves photography and we were not disappointed our expectations were exceeded.This garden was amazing not many tourist in the garden during our visit. They are sometimes shut on Tuesdays so check at tourist office before you go. Cost expensive",
          "Don't go home from Nara if you haven't visit this place. This Garden is simply breathtaking. The garden is very beautiful and peaceful. There's a caf\u00e9 shop that overlooks the garden wherein you can order coffee, tea or even beer and appreciate the beauty and peacefulness of",
          "If you want to see a truly beautiful Japanese garden don't miss this one There is a free garden next door called the Japanese garden it is worth seeing both Also there are free guides very helpful",
          "Isuien Garden is a beautiful garden well worth its entrance fee. It is a rather large garden and also has a teahouse / restaurant at its premises. Take your time in strolling around.",
          "This was probably the loveliest garden we visited in our two weeks in Japan. It's a strolling garden that uses 'borrowed sceney' ie elements outside the garden as part of the view. There are ponds and streams, moss gardens and little shrines and tea houses. We were lucky enough",
          "Here is one of those gardening gems for which Japan is so rightly famous. This garden and the similar once next to it (free entry) are themselves alone worth the trip to Nara. The extremely detailed use of all the natural elements to create such beauty and harmony is",
          "A very nice example of old Japanese garden. We were lucky to visit it in Autumn when trees are colorful. It worth a visit.",
          "This garden is the one place you must visit if you go to Nara. Very beautiful, quiet, and large enough to wander around for a good hour. Entrance fee is \u00a5900, also including the museum (not much to see though).",
          "This was the highlight of our day trip to Nara. Todaiji is a must see of course, but was very crowded. This on the other hand was pretty, quiet and serene. There's an area with a few benches where one can sit and enjoy the scenery and atmosphere for a bit. Highly recommended.",
          "There are many gardens and parks throughout Japan and this puts them all to shame. An absolutely beautiful stroll, I had a free tour guide tell me about the front and back garden so that helped add to experience. It was gorgeous when I went with some of the trees turning to red",
          "Isuien Garden is a must-see if you're in Nara. It's the only walking garden in Nara and it's beautifully preserved. They charge an admission fee of about 900JPY but the scenery is worth it.",
          "A very large and well-known garden in Nara. A visit requires a couple of hours to complete what is essentially a loop track to appreciate the multiple features here that include tea houses, picturesque bridges over water features and lovely ponds. A visit in November, which",
          "Great garden which will look stunning in autumn. Enjoyed a lovely stroll through the garden. Filled with small patches of moss, delightful!",
          "My great regret is that I visited at the start of October rather than towards the end of October. The leaves on a few of the trees were just starting to turn, but I could see it would be spectacular when the leaves are changing fully. It's a very pretty and charming garden,",
          "Really lovely quiet garden with windy paths and good views. It's free for foreigners and the lady at the reception was polite.",
          "We happened upon this garden on a day trip to Nara. Much of the park was swarmed with people (and deer), so this garden was a welcome break from the crowds. Well worth the $8 fee (810 yen since the museum was closed that day). The garden was well-kept and had small signs with",
          "We had just had an interesting trip to the impressive big golden buddha after dodging deer in the park (as an aside, they are fine - not a problem, and it is quite funny watching them cross the zebra crossing, obeying the lights)! It was a hot day and this lovely garden with its",

          "If you are tight on time, go to yoshiki en garden next door. It's free for foreigners (show passport) instead of y900 here. It's smaller but similar.",
          "I love Japanese gardens, so this was a must for me to visit. In your ticket, there is a guide included who walks you through the garden, tells you its history and also some information about plants, garden architecture and carps. I very much enjoyed.",
          "The beautiful, manicured gardens are not large but are a great place to escape the crowds, sit and have a few moments of peace. They are also cool, even on a hot, steamy day. The museum is very small and does not house much of great interest. If you are on a strict budget,",
          "Compare to the Great Buddha of Todaiji temple and over crowded photo shooting with deers in Nara park, this is the place where one can enjoy the peace and atmosphere of Zen. One can enjoy tasty ice-cream in the tea house overlooking the garden. For ones who has difficulties to",

          "Very beautiful gardens within walking distance from Nara Park. Not free but worth seeing. Earlier in the morning right when the open is usually best to avoid mosquitos.",
          "A tranquil garden close to highways and residences. Masterful creation of separate spaces, each with the sound of water and beautiful vistas. Entrance fee (about $10) also includes a small museum with a lovely collection of celadon ceramics (mostly Korean).",
          "This was quite a nice garden, and on the way to Todaiji temple. Beautiful and peaceful but not necessarily unique or the best among Japanese gardens. Not a must see for the admission price of 900 yen, which is on the high side compared to other attractions.",
          "We spent about an hour here after walking about 15 minutes from Nara Park. There were hardly visitor when we were there so we strolled leisurely around the garden. It was tranquil and quite beautiful. If you have an extra hour, it is worth the time to visit Isuien Garden.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, this was one of the most beautiful settings in Japan. There were no crowds and it is a peaceful, lovely and historical garden.",
          "More intimate than the larger public gardens. Lovely layout and planting with good borrowed landscape of the buildings in Nara park such as Nandai-mon gate, and the surrounding hills.",
          "A beautiful and quiet Japanese garden with two ponds, nicely trimmed trees and thatched roofs buildings serving as tea houses or old rest houses. You can have a Japanese tea in the tea house while admiring the landscape sitting on tatami mats. The many maple trees make it",
          "We were walking from Gangoji Temple to Todaiji Temple and happened to pass the entrance to this garden. We were looking for somewhere to rest in some quiet away from the crowds in Nara that day - so we popped into the garden. It was beautiful. Well landscaped and quiet. Far",
          "This was a beautiful traditional garden in the heart of Nara. It was not very crowded because of the entrance fee. If you are a fan of gardens, then you will want to see this.",
          "We had just visited the Temple and Buddha in Nara, which was absolutely packed with school trips. We had decided to seek out this garden. We were almost put off by the 900 yen entrance fee, but were glad we weren't. Compared to the crowds in the park and the temple, this was",
          "Glorious 400 year old garden that is an absolute delight. The entry price is steep at 900 yen but it was the most perfect example of a Japanese garden that we saw on our trip.",
          "We visited this garden early in the morning on our side trip to Nara. The price is a bit steep (900 yen for adults), but I think it was worth the price. The garden was absolutely stunning, and there were very few other visitors (most likely due to the steep price). If you want",
          "Isuien is a nice Japanese Garden close to the Todai-ji Temple in Nara. There are 2 parts of the garden, one made in Edo period (17th century) and the other made in Meiji period (19th century). The entrance fee is a little bit expensive(900 yen), but it's worth visiting this",
          "It is without doubt a beautiful garden. The attached museum is not really worth wasting time on. You can see part of it already by taking a tea in the neighbouring tea house without paying the entrance fee. There is another free garden yoshiki-en just beside it. I actually liked",
          "We were apprehensive in paying the 900 yen entrance fee, but the tourist information center staff told us this is \"the most highly rated garden in all of Japan by tourists\". It's underwhelming, and even if it was free - the time isn't worth it if you're doing a day trip from",
          "Very high entrance fee as they only sell a combo ticket with the next door shocker of a museum. The gardens are nice and some decent pictures can be taken, but it is very small and not in any way worth the money.",
          "A short distance from Todai-ji Temple is the Isuien Garden, which is often ignored by tourists in preference for the more famous temple. The gardens are incredibly peaceful and picturesque, and the staff are very helpful, with one even offering a free tour in English. If you",
          "The entrance fee was surprisingly high (900 yen, but that day the inside museum was closed so only 810 yen, still very expensive), so my expectations rose drastically. The garden couldn't reach them because it's true that it is quite nice but I didn't feel the awe I longed for.",
          "Nice, quiet and scenic garden but nowhere near stunning. Nothing special about this garden especially given the entrance fee required (\u00a5820). However, it might be more scenic during late autumn.",
          "Although there is an entrance fee, it is worth paying it. There are some volunteers who explain the history of the gardens. It is a peaceful and wonderful place.",
          "One reviewer complained about the entrance fee. I think it's fair, and it certainly keeps the numbers down which means those that pay and enter have a relatively peaceful garden to enjoy. Wonderful colour when we were there in April, and lots of good photos taken.",
          "It was really peaceful and relaxing, the garden is beautiful. I wish I could visit it again. Worth it!",
          "Stopped here on the way to Nara Park and temple area. We were greeted and offered a free Guide to show us around the gardens. The area is beautifully kept and peaceful",
          "The entrance fee to this garden is 900Yen per adult. It is not value for money and the plants and landscape there is not that great. There are sign board all over stating please do not step on the moses. Quite annoying. There is a garden next door which is free to tourist.",
          "Don't skip this one, it was the highlight of our Nara visit to see the two gardens.It is also very quiet in there even though Tennoji was packed with people. You can sit in peace and harmony and take in the scenery. The amount of detail within the gardens is a marvel to behold-",
          "This zen garden was fun to visit and very beautiful. We were guided around it by a volunteer who spoke surprisingly good English so were able to learn more specific reasons for its current design. I highly recommend you ask about that. It is small though and can probably be in",
          "I was so surprised seeing how peaceful and calm Nara was, not many tourist at all BUT the scenery ommgg so beautiful it does not lose to Kyoto at all! when i first step into Isuien garden i was just mesmerised seeing how well and beautiful they maintained the garden...the autumn",
          "It's a beautiful garden. What can I say. I visited the garden on Oct of 2015, Thursday morning. There were 4 people in the garden besides me when I visited. There was a volunteer guide who spoke English who gave me a private tour and explained to me things that I'd never",
          "Unfortunately it was raining the day I went to see the Isuien Garden but that didn't take away from how beautiful and breathtaking this garden is. Seeing the trees turning brown, red and yellow was a beautiful sight! The walking paths give you opportunities to take perfect",
          "Most landscape in Japan is awe-inspiring but the beauty of the Isuien is that if you visit it first thing in the morning, you might be one of the few people there and enjoy the lovely landscape in solitude. A must visit in Nara!",
          "Less crowded than the other attractions of Nara even on a Sunday morning. Not so easy to find so ask a policeman to find the left hand turn off the main street. Very peaceful walk to get there. BTW there is wonderful free garden next door to the right. free to any non-Japanese,",
          "This is a lovely garden to look at before you hit the big temples! There were free English speaking guides to talk to you about the history of the place, and they take your photo with your camera! About the only pics I'm in! It costs to get in, but you also get to visit the",
          "when we visited the gardens were really quiet, most toruists only get to see the bronze buddha so this is a ideal get away from the crowds location, lovely place to rest",
          "This garden is a hidden gem in Nara Park. It is such a beautiful garden, but there was hardly anyone there. I suppose most people visit the major attractions first. We visited this spot on our second day and were rewarded with the visit. The adjoining Neiraku Art Museum included",
          "Quite a large garden, lots to explore, very peaceful and a good contrast to the busyness of the Toshodaiji complex.",
          "the entire garden is superbly landscaped! great picture opportunity! lots of flowers and very serene!",
          "A lovely garden situated just at the fringe of Nara Park. It has a nice pond and one can take lots of pictures with Todai-ji Temple as the background.",
          "Out of all the sites we've visited, Isuien garden is my favourite. It has such a beautiful layout besides just the main garden view. Well worth also walking along all the other small paths throughout the garden. This should be on everyones list to visit in Nara! Entry fee is a",
          "Walking distance from Toda-ji Temple, this garden is well worth a visit. Most tourists visiting nearby Today-ji bypass this in their rush. That's good news for the traveller with more time to enjoy the garden. There's a museum on site that is also well worth a visit. Local",
          "It was so peaceful to walk in this garden with such a beautiful view that was feast for your eyes. Everything is carefully maintained but the effort was not too apparent and it gave natural feel to this place. I was there in the beginning of autumn so the leaves have started to",
          "This was our first stop on our trip to Nara. What a lovely garden it is! There were stunning vistas, with some leaves just beginning to change. There was a lovely pond with stepping stones to one side of a small island and a stone bridge to the other side. This was a more open",
          "Having death with the hustle bustle of the park and the Temples, entering this garden was truly a new universe. It is hard to envision yourself I. An urban landscape when at every turn there is yet another perfectly reflected tree or naturally sculpted rise. Could could have",
          "Isuien is a combination of two gardens. The Front Garden was designed during the Edo period while the Back Garden was designed during the Meiji era. Both gardens have ponds and tea houses, and excellent views. The Back garden, for example, also gives a view of the Todaiji\u2019s",
          "I understand that the original garden was designed and built in the 17th Century, it was modernized in the 20th century, on several acres and the Japanese government turned it into a spectacular site, with easy to manage walks, an incredible variety of trees -- I especially",
          "We found this little gem very enchanting and just beautiful. Way better than eg the famous Okayama garden. Isuien has it all, a pond, waterfall, tea house and more. With 3000 jpy a bit expensive especially for a family of 4. If you are not a garden fanatic , visit the free",
          "Located Near Nara park you find this garden. Decorated in Japanese style two small ponds form the center. Quiet and peaceful to stay here for a while",
          "This was my second time here and the garden is impeccable with fantastic landscaping. Every area was well thought out, picturesque, and breathtaking. Take the free English speaking guide tour and learn about the long rich history of this garden. The guide shared interesting",
          "I walked 15 minutes to get here from Todaiji Temple, finished strolling around the garden in 20 minutes. The lake in the middle is the main highlight, try to go early in the morning to get good pictures when the sunlight is not so harsh. There is small traditional restaurant",
          "If the Nara crowds at Todai-ji have worn you down, Isuien Garden is a good place to recover your tranquility. It's a beautiful garden walk, with several ponds and streams, a functioning tea house, and, for an added bonus, a museum housing some very nice ceramic pieces, exquisite",
          "Beautiful garden, a bit small and there are nicer gardens elsewhere in Japan but if you are in Nara for a day and have time then it is worth going. Next door there is another garden and is free for foreigners.",
          "Beautiful Japanese garden at Nara.the garden is divided in two parts, and were built in two different periods - the Edo period and the Meiji era. The front garden is smaller, but very pretty and serene. The back garden is built around a large lake. Unfortunately, the art",
          "If you love gardens, you'll like this place. I love gardens so I enjoyed the walk around the garden. However, if you are neutral to gardens like my husband, the 900Yen entrance fee is rather pricey compared to the other entrance fees we paid in Kyoto and Nara. We didn't stay",
          "This garden offers a peaceful moment of rest between the visits to the temples, there are very beautiful views, great for nice pictures, you can walk around or just sit and enjoy the silence and the view. Not particularly interest in the nearby museum.",
          "One of the gardens you can visit in Nara park. We were lucky that there are a couple of very nice Japanese elderly who offered to gave us a tour of the garden, which made us fully appreciate the design and the history of the place.",
          "We found this place recommended in the guidebook. It was quite tricky to find, and we almost gave up at one point... We were very glad we didn't. It was our favourite spot in Nara, tranquil, spiritual and painstakingly well maintained. Not as popular as the main attractions, but",
          "We were here on a hot day in summer. A little disappointed that there wasn't much blooming, but still worth a 30 minute walk through to get away from the world.",
          "The best Japanese Garden we have seen in this trip, we have been to Osaka, Nara, Kobe, Kyoto, Tokyo, this Isuien Garden has all the Japanese tea Garden feature in one. It is not easy to find Isuien, it is so close to Todaiji Temple, but no signs to direct you, have to ask",
          "Really don't understand why this garden is rated so high, there are way better gardens in the Kansai area. Maybe because we visited in June, but still, in the fall or spring other places would be prettier too. Anyways, I thought the Manyo/Shinen Botanical garden was more",
          "This was one of the most beautiful gardens we saw on our trip - and we saw a lot of gardens! It is not a huge garden but big enough to spend maybe up to an hour wandering around. There are two large ponds, front and back with fabulous landscaping, trees, shrubs, rock features",
          "My wife and two sons visited back in April. We spent around an hour here before going over towards Todai-Ji. The garden is beautiful and picturesque. We were fortunate enough to have a tour guide show us around (free of charge and refused to take payment!) and he was very",

          "Isuien is located in central Nara and is divided into two parts, a front garden and a rear garden, with a number of tea houses, streams, waterfalls, and ponds scattered throughout. The front garden has a longer history, dating back to the early Edo period. The rear garden, the",
          "This garden can be easily done in half an hour. Its very close to nara deer park so we decided to stop by. It may be small but it is stunningly beautiful. yes the 900Y fee is steep but the work that goes into this garden does make it worth it.",
          "I wouldn't understand somebody who doesn't like this garden. Quintessential Japanese garden. Perfection.",
          "If you want to visit a typical Japanese garden you should definitely visit Isuien Garden. The entrance fee is quite expensive with 900 Yen but worth. You can see all the tree mountains around Nara from this Garden. You should sit down for a moment and enjoy the view and the",

          "A nice Japanese garden. Small and interesting. Not more. if you are here, do not miss it. This is not the main attraction in Nara park.",
          "I could only give this 3 stars since it certainly is a beautiful and peaceful garden, in a land full of beautiful and peaceful gardens. Not as impressive as a place like Shukkein in Hiroshima. Full of tea houses around the lake, I would have given a higher rating if not for the",
          "It is a private garden and has some very beautiful scenes. Great if you are a photography lover. Not sure it worth the money of 900 yen. But, it does offer a museum to watch and a locker to put your bags while you watch the park, FREE!",
          "Not to be missed, especially if you've enjoyed some of the Kyoto gardens. Down the hill from Todaiji. In terms of must sees, I rank this just below the Kofukuji and Todaiji treasure houses (medieval Buddhist wooden sculptures) and above the Kasuga jina and certainly the Nara",
          "This is a very cute little garden located a five minute walk from Todaji temple. You could spend thirty minutes walking around it. There is also the possibility to partake in a tea ceremony there.",
          "Start your Nara tour from this garden. There is another garden located next to this one. Nara park and todaijji temple are just meters away from this garden",
          "This garden is quite a long walk from the main area, but can be combined with a trip to the Todeji. We arrived at 4.30pm just in time for the last entry, but to be honest 30 minutes was enough to walk round the garden as it is small. The little museum was closed so get there",
          "Definitely one of the most beautiful garden I have ever seen -- and Japanese gardens are beautiful in general anyway. I simply couldn't believe how amazing it is. A definite must.",
          "I visited in April in the rain and the cherry blossoms were out. It was lovely. I would like to see it a few weeks later when the azaleas are blooming. You must see this garden and have tea in the tea house!",
          "With Cherry Blossoms in full bloom, this traditional Japanese garden provided a lovely atmosphere for a stroll and a break from the crowds of Nara park. The beautifully delicate landscaping is interesting to explore and neat surprises are all around. Highly recommended.",

          "I stumbled across Isuien Garden while walking through Nara on my way to Todai-ji. The entrance fee was for both the museum and the garden, and while I was not very impressed by the museum, the garden definitely made up for it! The garden was extremely serene and fairly secluded.",
          "This is what a Japanese garden should be. It is immaculately kept and most refined and delicate, with some lovely detail at every turn. Well worth a visit.",
          "My husband and I spent the day in Nara today which was a welcome adventure away from Kyoto (which has been quite dissapointing). We visited Isuien Garden as part of a guided free tour by a lovely man Tetsuo who works for the NPO Nara Guide Club. Even though today's temperature",
          "Very nice garden, in Nara park. Very quiet and relaxing, to rest a bit from the crowds visiting the rest of places. The ticket is a bit expensive (900 \u00a5) but includes the museum with some beautiful art from XVII and XVIII century",
          "There was only 2 other people there when I visited. The entrance was quite expensive at 900Y but this included a free guided tour (in excellent english) and the small museum next door. Wonderfully manicured garden...and great example of thatched Japanese buildings",
          "We enjoyed exploring this traditional Japanese garden, which although in January was still quite lovely.",

          "This garden is a perfect break from the bustle of the crowds and tourists in Nara. Entry is slightly expensive but is also next to Yoshikien Garden which has free entry, so in reality you might be paying for both. Very manicured and carefully planned layout with a wonderful",
          "Very beautiful garden, but I think it's expensive compared to other gardens. If you like nature, I'm sure you're gonna live it! I went about 4pm, so there were shadow in some places. I think it would be even better going about noon.",
          "After the crowds of the Todaiji temple this garden provides a tranquil break. A compact location but with lovely vistas and colours",
          "Well with a visit to be away from the crowds. The price is on the high side and the museum a waste of time. But I would happily pay again. Also I would recommend visiting in the morning as the light will be best for photos",

          "Im glad we did go here. We were greeted by lots of deers. We didnt buy the cookie though but they still came and greeted us with a bow. Fun to watch them rest, mingle and even snatch your bag \ud83d\ude1c The backdrop view was great too. This is the nicest park Ive been so far",
          "We had the 7-day JR Pass and took the Yamatoji Line from Tennoji Station to Nara Station. It was a fair distance to Nara Park, so we opted for the Nara city Loop Bus, 1-day pass, which was a good decision, for 500y. You'll need to wait at Bus stop No.2. Walk out of Nara",
          "I brought my brothers here during New Year's Eve and the park was packed full of people. The entire area was filled with festival stands selling amazing street food like grilled octopus, Kobe beef steak on a skewer, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, etc. There were tons of deer relaxing in",
          "I know its surprising but you dont have to buy the biscuits, the deers will come to you regardless and let you pat them. If you have biscuits they will go crazy because they love the biscuits and do anything to eat all of the ones you have, so dont buy them! we didnt we spent 3",

          "This is a great day out from either Kyoto or Osaka. The deers are free range however they seem to hangout in one area near the bus station. We had a 6 month in tow, handy to know the bus station has a full baby feeding area. Great fun, just watch little ones around the deers at",
          "Deers are everywhere, from the streets to temples and grass landscapes. Droppings are also everywhere, but the locals are sweeping it up when they see it. Dont get too concern with stepping on them. Apparently i went during the mating season; where they may be more",
          "It is an awesome experience, not only for my boys, but also for the parents! We are lucky we have a very informative tour guide who informed us on what to and not to do with the deer in the park to avoid aggressive behaviors of them. If you feed them, they will surely gather",
          "The deer here were VERY aggressive towards my children, they kept ramming them and knocking them down. One knocked my 3 year old son by the nub of a horn (they had already de-horned these creatures) and flung him through the air like a football. I hope that my children aren't",
          "I always imagined deers to be too uptight and ready to flee upon sensing the presence of people, but these deers made me appreciate them up close, so friendly. Be careful though feeding them, because once a deer gets a piece of acorn or deer food, the rest would gang up on you,",
          "Unlike other park..this park is a home of hundreds of deer. You can feed the deer by buying a biscuit which cost you 200 yen..however don't be afraid..since you hold the biscuit a lot of deer will coming to get the biscuit instantly..the park is clean..if you continue to explore",
          "It was a fun place for friends, families and couples. Note that you will need to buy biscuits to feed the deers (do not feed them with outside food). The deers are so smart, they learnt to bow their heads to beg for food, they are so very cute!",
          "Such a nice place to visit... you can walk around with a lot of deers... you can also feed them with some food they sell locally.. But be careful not to have spare food in you pockets because they can easily find them LOL). We enjoyed a lot!!!",
          "There are many deer here and they are rather calm until there is food. However, when you bow to the deer, some of the deer will bow back which is very cute. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while strolling in the park. Love the environment.",
          "Incredible and magic place! The deers are very charming and so sweet. As long as you treat them well they\u2019ll do the same! Definitely recommend feeding them with the crackers that are sold on site.",

          "Visited the park in mid Jan and was charged 200 yen for deer biscuits. Although wild, the deers are so used to Humans they almost seem docile, just minding their own business in this protected park. Animal instincts kick in when it comes to feeding with some, so conditioned,",
          "I went to Nara park this afternoon, walked around and fed the deers which were fun but my highlight was riding on the rickshaw. It was my first time so i was nervous but the experience was amazing. My driver spoke really well English and explained everything nicely and easy to",
          "Nara Park is a must to see and it's huge. Been there last month and the different colors and shapes of the trees and leafs are just simply unique, so as the view. If you go when there is not a big crowd, then even better because you can enjoy the peacefulness of the park.",
          "I was here in November, but just before the proper autumnal colours had arrived...nonetheless it was beautiful! I spent quite a lot of time wandering around the park in the quieter places away from the areas near the main road. I saw plenty of deer as you would expect as Nara",

          "Had such a great time feeding the beautiful deer! We bought deer crackers and were amazed when they immediately came toward us and bowed asking for a snack. Be aware however, once they know you have food, they can get a little aggressive. I provided a cracker to one, then",

          "If you come to Nara you have to come here. The park is huge and definitely walk around in addition to feeding the deer. The deer are not afraid to come right up to you to get a biscuit and some maybe a little more mean than others. If you have small children this is something",
          "We visited Nara park and stayed there overnight, in a very comfortable inn, with wifi but no tv, wich was wonderful. The park is splendid, with its many temples and shrines scattered all around. The deers are everywhere, some of them more interactive, expecting to be fed with",

          "Large park, vile toilets, cranky deer. We rode a bus from the train station to the park, which was easy and short. A large grassy park with oodles of adorable deer. The novelty wears off when the deer start gouging their horns into your children, or biting at your clothes",
          "The park is BIG. The deer are friendly. The deer and park are awesome. My kids just love to feed the deer and looking the deer bowed to you when the deer asking for food from you (my kid bowed back to the deer). A place cannot be missed.",

          "The park and surrounding area is lovely. The deers are very friendly so if you are scared of animals this place may not be for you . Only buy the deer wafers if you want to feed them, break them in half to make them last longer. Bow to the \ud83e\udd8c it will bow back to you.",
          "We love animals and wanted to see the bowing deer. They were great, BUT ask yourself if you\u2019d be happy with thousands of humans harassing you, over-feeding you and touching you when you are pregnant and trying to rest under the trees. I found it kind of depressing to watch. We",
          "Easy train ride from osaka (or kyoto) for a day trip. Love the deer, and they are everywhere. If you want to get away from the crowds go further up. We loved feeding the deer (and yes they can get very aggressive once they know you have food). If that distresses you, dont buy",
          "Deers found in every corner of the park! They will not hesitate to look to you for crackers, even to the extent of nudging you or even biting you. At least they would be 'polite' about it by giving the standard Nara deer bow. Which makes it hard to resist giving them the treat.",
          "A visit to Japan wouldn\u2019t be complete without feeding the deer in Nara. The \"deer cookies\" are sold throughout the park and can be fed to the deer. You have to raise your hand with the cookie first, wait for them to bow, and then feed it. They are so adorable when they bow!",
          "It is unusual to get so close to a wild animal. But years of being hand fed by tourists have made them very docile. They are every where, and so is their poop! So be careful where you tread. Plenty of vendors selling food for the deer. Plenty of photo opportunities.",
          "I admit at first glance it\u2019s nice being so close to the animals, that are walking around freely, and to take pictures and videos. However, this aw-effect starts to wear off very quickly and you start to see the negative aspects. 1) the fur of the deer does look unhealthy. This",
          "Love all the deer walking around. Easy to buy crackers to feed them. They can get aggressive if you done give them the crackers, but one of the coolest experience!",
          "The deer in the park were with so many and very adorable Weather forecast was not great but we were lucky only few drops of rain in our way back We decided last min to rent bikes. As walking to park from JR station is 20 min The bikes were only 700 yen. We cycled through the",
          "Had an absolute blast feeding the deer here. First warning: the deer here are not shy. On the contrary, they can get quite aggressive. (parents of kids please take note!) Once they know you have food, they'll shove you, nip at your pants, push their noses into your hands, and",
          "The park is very nice and designed to host a lot of tourists. The deer are friendly and welcoming especially when you feed them with specific deer crackers. The signs can be improved.",
          "We Enjoyed feeding and petting the deers but, the deer tend to be aggressive and they poke your behind begging for more cookies. We were lucky to see the wisteria in full bloom. \u00a5500 entrance fee was worth it. The deers were roaming freelt.",
          "This is a huge and lovely park, with a great museum and several separate UNESCO sites worth a visit. It's also home to the quasi-tame sacred deer; the deer run the place, and most of the cit near the park, and can get pretty feisty when they think you've got food, to the point",
          "Deers were very cute and gentle. Weather was good, Nice place for a walk. You can buy deer feed for 150yen yo feed the deers. You can also walk through the park to the todaiji temple.",
          "I visited Nara as a day trip from Kyoto. It's about an hour by train. This is a nice park to have a walk in spring. The deer in the park are an attraction. It's fun to watch. Search for the quieter places to escape the crowds.",
          "Awesomely fun place for young and old. By the time we reached Nara, we had seen many deer. Nara's deer has a history of more than 1000 years. They are known as the Oracles, loved and protected. Nara's mascots are deer. There are about 1,200 wild deer in Nara Park. They are very",
          "The main attraction of Nara are the deer roaming the park grounds freely instead of caged or in an enclosure. People can feed the deer with biscuits and take pictures up close. The novelty wears off quite easily though and you notice the negative aspects such as deer poop lying",
          "As soon as you get off the bus you\u2019ll want to buy biscuits and feed the deer. Don\u2019t. Get walking up hill and it gets quieter about 20 minutes in. Go all the way up and we found some younger, less aggressive deer who were more than happy to wait for the biscuits. The views from",
          "Really easy to get here for a day trip from Kyoto. A lot of walking involved, but well worth it to get to see the giant Buddha in that beautiful temple. Other temples and a gorgeous little garden on the way, plus of course, the almost tame deer.",
          "It\u2019s worth going here just to watch the tourists screaming and fleeing from the deer who get a little excited when the food comes out. You need to be careful as they can nip and leave a mark. Watch out for your bags and belongings as they will be into everything looking for a",
          "This park's nearest station is Kintetsu-Nara Station. From the station, it is about 10 to 15 mins walk till you hit the inner park. There are a lot of deers roaming around freely for you to feed. Along the path from the station, there will be some vendors selling the biscuits",
          "Great day trip and worth a visit purely for the todeji and deer park. No where else have I seen deer so tame and willing to come near and interact with humans. If you now and choose the right temperment of deer you\u2019re bound to get a good shot! For example some of the deer at the",
          "There's a lot of cute deers! Nuff' said right? You just need 2-3 hours looking around the area, play with the deers, go to the Big Buddha temple just 10 mins walk away. It was a very simple place to visit, you don't need to rush for anything and it makes it so relaxing to",
          "So this was a visit to allow my 2.5year old to enjoy the company of the deers but the deers nearer to the train station on the way to the park are definitely conditioned to be way more aggressive than they should be. The term gentle deer didn\u2019t go so well with my kid when a deer",
          "The main attraction here is definitely the deers. When you feed them with crackers, they bow you after that. So sweet. You can walk around the park and feed the deers as often as you want. Some of them behave better than others. The park itself is nice, with lovely picture",
          "The park is famous for the deer that roam around freely, you can feed them by buying the crackers food from the side vendor that sells them. But prepare to be surrounded by a lot of them once you start feeding them, they can bow their head every time they ask for food :) just",
          "it was really a good experience for my family specially my kids to have a close encounter with the deers at the Nara park. We fed the deer and they were very tame. you can buy and feed the deer with the deer senbei at 150jpy You can touch them and have photo with them without",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, with Optional Excursion to Nara Park. If you are in a hurry, most likely you can see everything within 2-3 hours. As with most attractions in Japan, very well organized (and of course, extremely clean!). We enjoyed seeing the deer and",
          "Went on a weekday afternoon. A pretty decent walk from the train station. Fun to feed the deer, they were quite tame in the evening. Maybe they were full from all the other tourists feeding them throughout the day.",
          "Managed to cover all the 3 shrines and the deers in Nara within 2 hours upon arriving in Nara. In Japan, everything is well organized and nearby. A day trip is sufficient for those wanting to see the deer",
          "If you really feel lonely in Nara and want to do some socializing, the deer of the Nara Park would welcome you among their midst. Beautiful park that engulfs within its premises shrines, temples, gardens, and deer. If it is a short stay in Nara, do spend a full day at the park.",
          "Nice place for relax and watching deers and feed them with rice crackers which you can buy on every corner. So you can relax and rest before you will continue to enjoying beauty of Nara. Please just really don't feed the deers with anything else or you can harm this beautiful",
          "Nara park is one of the main tourist spots in Japan as who would not love to walk among deer? After a few stops on the train, we arrived at Nara to visit the deer park. Just before the ascent to the park, you will find a famous shop making mochi where the guy beats his hands",
          "The deer at Nara park roam around freely and seek food from visitors. It can get very busy in Nara but still worthwhile checking out these deer.",
          "It pains me to report that the Nara deer of today are in bad shape and mean, unlike the ones of yesteryear's. Back then, they had beautiful & clean fur and were much more friendly. Today, they are dirty and greedy! One stepped on my toes in a rush to fight for food, and oh",
          "Nara is an amazing city, probably the nicest in Japan. Over 1.000 deers are walking on the streets and in the park and you can feed them or play with them. The temple is amazing and the entire atmosphere is really great.",
          "This place is amazing! Not only does it have beautiful historical temples for the adults to see, but all the deers also kept my 2 young kids entertained. They had great fun feeding those deers. Be careful of the males, they get aggressive. This is not to be missed when you",
          "The park itself is a very unique place to walk through, with all the statues and lanterns all about. It would be quite amazing to re-visit when they are all lit (I'm told twice a year). It's very much a park feel, though greatly covered with trees along the stone paths and",
          "A fun place to walk around. The deer are an added bonus. For a price you get these wafers that you feed the deer and they will come feed from your hands. Keep in mind that these are still wild animals and treat them with respect. We noticed a few people tease them with the",
          "nice place to relax, pet friendly deer, feed them and take a strall towards the Todaiji temple. lots of photo opportunities",
          "This is a must-do if you\u2019re in Nara. The park itself doesn\u2019t actually feel that big when you\u2019re walking around it so that might contribute to it feeling very busy. There are lots of little stalls within the park selling deer crackers for 150 yen for around 8 crackers.",
          "You can spend the day in Nara. There are so many deers - not just in the park but around the whole area in the lead up to the temple. You can buy crackers for 150 Yen and the deers will not leave you alone if they know you have food. Best to break them in half so they last",
          "The previous reviews are true. The deer are used to human contact. Buy food for them at your own peril as they will chase and chew on you to get to it. We saw several kids (including 1 of our own) who were really distressed by the agression from some of the deer. Until now I",
          "I do think that it is a great place for all ages since the deer are usually friendly, but I does warn that they are wild animals and they can attack on some occasions. The people there do sell you special deer crackers to feed the deer with and if you to the deer nod the deer",
          "This is one of those places that can easily be one of the most cherished memories of Japan or quickly forgotten. It all depends when you go. If you go during the day, rush hour, evening... I don't think you will be very much impressed. The secret to this place, to have a magical",
          "Quite an experience feeding the deers. The deers are lovely and polite. Fun to try to take a wefie with them!",
          "It is easy to get to Nara from either Kyoto or Osaka, and it is another must do site along with Arashiyama. Tour the UNESCO world heritage sites, yes, multiple. Take a walk off the beaten path either in Nara Park or to the deeper shrines. The tranquility is another world from",
          "This was at the top of my list once we booked our Kyoto trip. It's about an hour train from Kyoto, so it is a bit of a trek, but it's worth it (FYI - it's also about in hour from Osaka so you can also use that as your jumping point). Once you get to Nara station, the park is",
          "The deer were so cute! If you have some food (you can buy deer crackers for \u00a5150, but we were also given some acorns by a lovely old man on a bicycle!), they will literally mug you! It was so funny - they don't hurt, but they will nip you (they kept biting my butt!). If you have",
          "These are WILD ANIMALS first and foremost. If you do plan on getting the deer crackers (deer feed sold at every corner of every road and junction in the park), be ready to be a deer magnet - they will come from far and wide to get the cracker out of your hand. We find the deer",
          "Nice litte park in Nara - a good option for a relaxed, cheap day out. You can see the deer, buy deer 'cookies' to feed them, take some lovely photos amongst the cherry blossoms, or just chill out.",
          "Really cute to have lot of deer\u2019s all around you. They are little aggressive so be careful with food and your bags. Apart from that they really are very cute.",

          "I know deers prefer to stay in the wild even if they are easy prey for fierce animals. But Nara is unique, deers roam freely sometimes they gently bonk your bags for cookies. Only feed them sold JPY150 cookies from vendors. I also had my takoyaki here which is so scrumptious.",
          "History, scenery, wildlife, fresh air and exercise - a perfect day out. The deer are more friendly than we imagined possible, especially if you buy the special cookies to feed them. We caught the end of the blossom season which made the day even more special.",
          "This place is pretty cool, deer feeding is a must, if you bow at them they will bow back to you. But be careful, if they think you have food and you turn your back on them, they will bite you on the bum.",

          "The park is very pretty and very big. There are free roaming deer everywhere. The deer are friendly and bow if you bow to them. Please respect the deer and don't tease them with food like I saw some people doing. Yes, they will chase after you if you have food readily available.",
          "Beautiful park with wild deers that would eat from your hand. Food vendors and ponds. Just be careful because they will eat your clothes :)",

          "I would highly recommend doing a tour to Nara. It's a massive place and apparently has 80 shrines/temples, but the main reason we went was for the deer. There are hundreds roaming around everywhere, and are just so chilled and friendly. When we visited, unfortunately there was a",
          "Day trip on catch from Osaka after visiting Kyoto. The park itself is quite large with many deer roaming freely. They will come to you if you are feeding them with food which can be bought from the stall. The deer do bow when receiving food. There is a large wooden temple in the",

          "We went to Nara to see the deer after seeing online recommendations and also the recommendations of friends. It was fun to see the deer roaming so closely around Nara and to see them 'bowing'. We enjoyed the gardens - really really enjoyed the Isuien and Yoshiken Garden more!",
          "Like others report if you can wake up early and based inTokyo get there by 8:15am to enjoy deer feeding. 150Yen will get you the special Deer Senebi crackers and they can be bought all over the park at the same price. Arrive at Kintetsu station, it\u2019s right on the doorstep of",
          "As you approach Nara Park, you can see as baby deers roaming the park as people. They are pretty harmless and some may pose for pictures with you but if you have a deer biscuit in hand, they will love you!! The deer biscuits are 150 Yen and available along the park by street",
          "Saw so many people feeding any old thing to the deer. If you must then buy the silly deer biscuits but don\u2019t feed them your sandwich or your map. They are completely habituated to people and don\u2019t understand what\u2019s good for them. Just think. What is a deer supposed to eat??",
          "This park is very nice, deer are everywhere. And there are more than you can imagine. You can buy food to give them but they will start following you. They also poop all over so watch your steps.",
          "The buildings are breathtaking and the scale of the park, the Buddhas, temple, pagodas is stunning, but particularly during cherry blossom season it is a tourist zoo. It\u2019s still very enjoyable to visit and you can get good clear views of everything, but if I go again I would",
          "It was a perfect day at Nara. A bit difficult to get there via Osaka since the trains are all confusing. It was nice and sunny outside and there were SOOOOOO many deer! You can get crackers for them for like 5 USD. And it's more than enough to feed them. An amazing",

          "We stayed in Japan for 9 nights, visiting 4 cities, and Nara was one of the highlights from our trip. Despite being rather small, there were a surprising number of temples to visit, a multitude of deers to feed, nice hills to hike and some great restaurants too. The park is",

          "There are a lot of deers here, and some may be quite aggressive, so don't attract too many deers at once, and don't tease them with the deer senbei. Don't feed them with food other than the sika senbei sold inside the park. (These are sold for only 150 yen, so just buy and",
          "An experience you should not miss. The park is just amazing. The local government is so helpful with a lot of free facilities and information points.",
          "It's a great place to visit all year round. Purchase some senbei for the deer and you are gold. Would advise to stay away from the more aggressive male deers though, they tend to bite at your belongings if you taunt them with food.",
          "Yes, if you have time in kyoto then its worth taking the train to Nara to see, feed and touch some of the hundred deers running freely in this huge park. The park has some temples and cherryblossom trees also. There is no entrance free to this park. The deers are cute and you",
          "We went here on our way to temples and shrines. There are deer everywhere. You buy special cookies for 150 yen to feed them. If they see you have cookies they can get a little aggressive. You are supposed to just go ahead and feed the ones close to you and not try and chose. The",

          "A day trip to Nara is definitely a possibility from a cruise ship, using local trains and then your best foot forward. Public transport is not expensive and easily accessible. On leaving the port area, 200m to reach the station (C11 Osakako on map) take the dark green line",
          "The scenery was great, sakura were beautiful! However, lots of very noisy tourists. It was so annoying we decided to leave early. Be sure to check Yoshikien Garden, which is right next to Nara Park: free for foreigners, and much more calm than Nara Park!",
          "Do hide the deer biscuits once you had purchased them cos the deers will finish them up within seconds \ud83d\ude2d Do save some further up for cuter deers which are less aggressive and in exchange for better photos",
          "A great park - busy though. The deer really do bow to you and are very happy to be stroked - especially when you have the 'deer biscuits' that you can buy from vendors there. They can smell them a mile off!",

          "Lots of deers! They are very cute but please note that they are not that kind as you expect. Please beware of your clothes and bags, they may bite it. Don't think bowing means they are politely asking for food, it's a sign of \"I am annoyed\" And.....please do not feed them by",
          "Soo many deer around and a first time seeing them not afraid people, coming up so close in the open. You start feeding one, they all gather and start to surround you and headbutt you for food. Its quite hilarious seeing kids getting surrounded soo fast.",
          "a wonderful natural place! unfortunately when we were there the trees have not yet bloomed, but still a beautiful place! we can only imagine how beautiful it is when everything is pink! Absolutely great attraction are deer at the same way that you can feed bought cookies!",
          "It's one of highlights in my home town of Nara. Feed the deer and they'll chase you for sometime. It's a great place to see cherry blossom in spring and autumn colors in fall.",
          "If you enjoy parks, temples, and deer, head over to Nara which is a ~35 min train ride from Osaka. The moment you get off Nara Station, you\u2019ll have to take the 10 minute local bus to Nara Park using your IC card that cost 500 yen (reference link for more info). Nara Park is huge",
          "They look cute, friendly and if you bow they will also bow back. Grab a 150 yen deer biscuit and start feeding the deer and that's were it all starts falling apart. The deers are wild, always keep that in mind. Feeding one or two or even three was great experience but as soon",
          "We read articles and traveller's blogs mentioned the deer in Nara Park, we never thought there are so many deer. While it is fun or seem like a must to buy biscuits to feed the deer, but do bear in mind that these are wide deer that had not been tamed. They can be slightly",

          "There are 1000+ deer roaming in the open. The deer feed out of your hands. The smaller deer are pushed away by the larger ones. One has to make an effort to reach the younger ones.",
          "I love this place! After spending time in the hard to grasp craziness of Tokyo or Osaka, Nara is a breath of fresh air. Literally! Other than the amazingly beautiful Todaji temple and the hundreds of bowing, occasionally aggressive (turns out they really, really like 7-11 egg",
          "Me and my partner really enjoyed our trip to Nara Park. Famously to feed the deer, and as well as visiting the various temples. We didn\u2019t expect for there to be a big market on too, which was a plus so we could buy some street food (yakitori, takoyaki etc)",

          "The park has a nice feeling to it. Lots of deers walking around, so be careful with all your snacks and food. If you have any on you, they'll most likely come for it, especially if they can smell it. Visiting there early morning is much nicer, especially for skipping the crowd.",
          "We have been here twice over 9 years, this time with our young boys that loved it as much as us, especially with the deer everywhere and being able to pet and feed them!",
          "What a place. My favourite place in Japan. Its not a zoo. The deer roam freely and you can feed them with food bought off of venders. Watching the deer bow in traditional Japanese fashion toget their snacks is incredible. Do not feed them unless they bow. Place is also",
          "Easy trip from Kyoto - we went for the afternoon. It was a 15-20 minute walk from the station. Huge park with lots of deer, and you can buy \"crackers\" to feed the deer. Kids love it, and it was fun watching people reacting to the deer. I wouldn't want to be there in summer",
          "Going to the Nara Park is definitely the type of an experience you won't ever forget. If you're hesitating whether to take a day trip from Kyoto or Osaka, or maybe even from Tokyo, then don't. Bright green grass everywhere you look, buddhist temples all around and on top of that",
          "Nara park is huge and there are hundreds of deer or all ages. There are three main sites (and lots of minor ones) to visit in the park and it really is fun wandering between them, buying rice biscuits and feeding the deer. We were there on a mild and dry day in February which",

          "You will without a doubt visit this park as it is where all the main temples are. At first I felt that the deer were a little exploited but you are overwhelmed with their cuteness. They do expect food and they can try to grab things from you. We did have some amazing experiences",
          "The park itself is nothing special - your typical temple lead-up with vendors and junk food What sets it apart is the deer and the cookies they sell to feed the deer. I hate deer - I live where they eat everything I plant. These guys are no different - they've been fed",
          "Of course you will see Deer in the park and get a chance to feed them. However there is more to see and do in the parl e.g. Toda ji Temple, Kasunga Taish Shrine etc",

          "I find theirs a lot do in the park, not just the deers. Don't forget to bring food for the deer. Nuts and fruit are what they like, the local lady told me. I did not see anywhere I could get any at the park, so bring your own. The rest of the park is beautiful, it's a must see.",
          "The park is an experience not to pass up. We took a longer walking route to get to the park and found where other deer like to get away from the more active part pictured which is also nice. If you\u2019re rushed by one of the males and he comes after all of your wafers, try handing",
          "What a place! Wild deer, beautiful scenery. You can buy deer biscuits for 150 yen per pack which is great fun to give to the deer as hey bow at you to ask for a biscuit. OK you might get mobbed like I did by friendly deer but it was so funny. One deer stuck his head in my",

          "This is a must visit, the main attraction in Nara. There's no other place in the world with an open park full of deers roaming around. The deers are generally harmless, except some can get aggressive when they see/smell food. There are also some souvenirs shops in the park.",

          "We enjoyed our Nara Deer Park trip. Deer are roaming around freely from the gate up to the park. They're not afraid of people and they will go near you once they know that you have their biscuit meal. They're so polite that if you bow 3 times, they will also bow 3 times.",

          "This was easily the highlight of my trip. (I know that now, that my trip is over.) Before going to Nara, I was skeptic about the deer and the place thinking that it would be a rip-off for tourists having to buy all those deer senbei (treats) and stuff... But once I am in Nara,",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. The deer roaming around was a unique experience. Its worth a visit to experience this place and the deer. It was a little crowded with people screaming because the deer approached them, which was little annoying.. was a little like a children petting",
          "The main attraction for Nara Park is the hundreds of tame deer that roam free. We were certainly not disappointed. You can purchase deer biscuits from a number of sellers in the park for 150 yen. Once you are in possession of the biscuits the deer become your best friend,",
          "There are a lot of deer here and they are usually hanging out near the stands that sell deer biscuits. The biscuits were 300 Yen if I remember correctly and you get 5/6 in a pack. The deer are surely the boss here and they can be aggressive. I had a Starbucks bag and one deer",

          "Its great to look at them, but if you want to feed them, be careful. (150 yenes costs)They can be insistent. They grabbed my clothes. Son hermosos , pero si queres alimentarlos sale 150 yenes. Cuidado porque se acercan r\u00e1pido y son insistenten. Me agarraban de la ropa.",
          "We stopped here for half an hour on a day tour, which was enough time to buy some crackers and feed the deer but I could have easily spent 2-3 hours here wandering in the park, having a snack, and exploring the nearby temple. The autumn colors lasted into December this year so",
          "Excellent place to visit to breath the Japanese architecture, culture and nature. Three in one. :) As a tourist you become a part of a wonderful Japan. When the Japanese come to Europe, they take photos of everything. Now I understand why! We did the same. Japan is unique!",

          "Lovely walk from the train station, on the way to the Todai-ji temple. The park is quite large, and make sure you keep walking through to the Todai-ji temple, you can get distracted by the shops and restaurants.",
          "You can buy special food for the deer they are tame but signs say they can get a little pushy.It is lovely to take a seat and soak up the ambience.",
          "About 15 to 20 minutes walk from Nara station, this deer park should be on your bucketlist if you visit Japan and have the JR pass. We went there from Kyoto which was on one train on the JR Nara line, about 1 hour and 5 minutes. Park is full of natural spirit from deers bowing",
          "I have never fed a wild deer so this experience is really memorable for me. Topped it with cherry blossom ambiance, it made our trip so calm and romantic. If food is what you after, this is not a place for a meal, but snacks are abundant here. There are nearby parks for cherry",
          "My wife, daughter and I enjoyed NARA Park on 3rd October 2018 as a part of One Day conducted tour. After getting down from the vehicle, as we approached a bit, several deer welcomed us and all other tourists. Following others we purchased biscuits and immediately dears snached",
          "The trip to Nara was worth it if nothing more than to see deer. You get tired of Temple hunting but having deer bowing to you in hope of a cracker or a pat was something different and definitely a highlight. Definitely recommend this if your on holiday in Japan",
          "The park is quite a way from JR Nara station so I'd recommend hiring bikes. The park is great, but it's so big you will walk a lot if you don't have a bike. The deer are everywhere ,and of course lots of historic sites. Good restroom facilities all over the park. Take a picnic",
          "We did a day trip here from Osaka. The park extends over a fairly large area with many deer roaming freely. Feeding them was quite entertaining, especially for the kids although some care is needed as the deer can get a little aggressive when they're hungry.",
          "nara park is about 20 minutes walk from JR Nara Station or 15 minutes from Kintetsu Nara Station. on a good day, it\u2019s a pleasant walk along sanjo dori street. well, there are deers everywhere. they are rather acquainted with tourists. they approach tourists fearlessly for food",
          "It's 45 mins train travel from Kyoto station. You can buy food for deer. Best way is to break the cookies into small pieces. So you can feed more and will be able to get more time to click a picture. Some food shops are there .",
          "love this park...nice park,you can relax and enjoy the deers...there a shop you can buy souvenier , take your photo with the deer.Remember this lovely place with family and enjoy your day."

        "wiki": "The Sh\u014ds\u014d-in (\u6b63\u5009\u9662) is the treasure house that belongs to T\u014ddai-ji in Nara, Nara, Japan. The building is in the azekura log-cabin style, with a raised floor. It lies to the northwest of the Daibutsuden (which houses the Great Buddha). The Sh\u014ds\u014d-in houses artifacts connected to Emperor Sh\u014dmu (701\u2013756) and Empress K\u014dmy\u014d (701\u2013760), as well as arts and crafts of the Tempy\u014d period of Japanese history.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the T\u014ddai-ji Buddhist temple complex was ordained by Emperor Sh\u014dmu as part of a national project of Buddhist temple construction. During the Tempy\u014d period, the years during which Emperor Sh\u014dmu reigned, multiple disasters struck Japan as well as political uproar and epidemics. Because of these reasons Emperor Sh\u014dmu launched a project of provincial temples. The T\u014ddai-ji was appointed as the head temple of these provincial temples. Emperor Sh\u014dmu was a strong supporter of Buddhism and he thought it would strengthen his central authority as well.  The origin of T\u014ddai-ji's Sh\u014ds\u014d-in repository itself dates back to 756, when Empress K\u014dmy\u014d dedicated over 600 items to the Great Buddha at T\u014ddai-ji to express her love for her lost husband, Emperor Sh\u014dmu, who died 49 days earlier. Her donation was made over five times across several years, then stored at the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in. During the Heian period, a large number of treasures, consisting of items and instruments used in important Buddhist services were transferred from a different warehouse called the Kensakuin to the T\u014ddai-ji.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, it came under the administration of the national government, and since World War II has been under the administration of the Imperial Household Agency. It is on the UNESCO register of World Heritage Sites as one of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara. It is also a National Treasure of Japan.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe building is in the Azekura Zukuri log-cabin style, with a floor raised to about 2.5 m takayuka-shiki (\u9ad8\u5e8a\u5f0f).  This is an architectural style that was mainly used for the construction of granaries and storehouses. Some distinctive features of this building style are the triangular, wooden beams that come together in the corners, as well as the fact that it was assembled without using any bolts nor nails. This could be slightly surprising for its height of 14 m, width of 33 m and depth of about 9.3 m. However, it was a logical and smart step. As a result of assembling the storehouse without bolts or nails, the structure became very flexible and able to withstand earthquakes, a phenomenon of nature that Japan was already well acquainted with during Nara period. The Sh\u014ds\u014d-in is also the only building to survive the Siege of Nara in the Heian period. The exact construction date is unclear, but construction works probably started soon after the empress's bequest in AD 756 and definitely were finished before AD 759, when the bequest items storage lists were complete.\n\n\n== Preservation of the artefacts ==\nSince the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in was to be a repository for (valuable) objects, it was constructed quite ingeniously to create a natural climate regulation system. This natural climate regulation system was created by elevating the floor to a height of 2.7 m. This made circulation of air underneath the building possible and protected the structure against humidity at the same time. In addition to this, during the first few decennia after its construction, the triangular beams of the Japanese cypress might have functioned as a natural regulator of humidity and temperature.\nThe artefacts themselves were stored away in chests made from Cedar wood that's known for its durability. These chests were 90\u2013110 cm long, 60\u201370 cm wide and 40\u201350 cm high. Not only the building itself but also these chests were elevated from the ground. All these adjustments made it possible to preserve the treasures in perfect state.\n\n\n== Treasures ==\nThe Sh\u014ds\u014d-in today holds around 9,000 items, excluding items that are yet to be classified. The treasures that were donated by Empress K\u014dmy\u014d were stored in the Hoku S\u014d, the Northern part of the Sh\u014ds\u014din. From the very beginning, this part of the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in has been sealed by the imperial family. One was permitted to enter only with explicit permission of the imperial family.\nWhile 95 % of the items of the collection are remainders from the 8th century and of domestic production, like art or documents, there is also a variety of items originating in Tang China, India, Iran, Greece, Rome and Egypt.\nAlthough these collections are not open to the public, selections are shown at Nara National Museum once a year in autumn.\nThe objects and treasures that have been stored in the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in can be divided into the following categories.\n\nFurniture Ch\u014ddo Hin (\u8abf\u5ea6\u54c1)\nGames Y\u016bgi gu (\u904a\u622f\u5177)\nMusic instruments Gakki (\u697d\u5668)\nClothing and accessories  Fukushoku (\u5fa9\u8077)\nWeaponry Buji (\u6b66\u4e8b)\nBuddhist objects Butsugu (\u4ecf\u5177)Apart from these objects for everyday use, pieces of writing (shoseki) have also been preserved in the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in. These pieces of writing can provide detailed stories about Nara period's society, social life, the population, social, cultural and economical activities.\n\n\n== Silk collection ==\nSince 1994, the Imperial Household Agency's Office of the Shoso-in Treasure House, which is responsible for the administration of the repository, has been producing exact reproduction of ancient Nara textiles. Apart from the appearance and colour, care has been given to reproduce the production and weaving style. The silk is donated each year by Empress Michiko, who personally runs the Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery at Tokyo Imperial Palace.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Kamakura Museum of National Treasures designed to resemble the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in, also holds a fine collection of Japanese art and sculpture.\nFor an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.\nKura (storehouse)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nImperial Household Agency page for Sh\u014ds\u014din (in Japanese)\nImperial Household Agency page for Sh\u014ds\u014din (in English)\nShosoin Tanabetsu Mokuroku (List of Shosoin Solid Objects)\nGuide to Shosoin research (Nara period written documents of the scriptorium)",

          "I visited the Todaiji Temple on June 13th with my family and I came away with quite an impression of the size of the structure. I knew the building was huge, but one does not realize how big this structure is until you stand at the entry door and look up inside the building. I",
          "Sometimes you have to prioritize (budget time & $) on which temples to visit and this is one of the top 5 to visit in the Kansai region. This was our favorite because of the size and grandeur of the wooden temple and beautiful surrounding grounds w/ the largest Buddha statue in",

          "Highlighting the largest Bronze Statue of Buddha in Japan, this Temple has an impressive aura of power. Less imposing are the Golden Buddha's either side. Constructed of timber this is one of the largest wooden structures in the world.",

          "Todai-ji is the place to go if you finally want to see something big in Japan. Home of the biggest bronze Buddha in Japan, it's quite a sight. Not only does it have one, it is also home to many other buddha statues as well. I really enjoyed it, as it was my first time seeing",
          "It was crowded but that didn't take a way from the beauty of this temple and the serenity I felt there. It has a big buddha statue which was very impressive in my opinion. Also to get here you have to walk through the popular deer park, that by itself makes it an awesome",
          "This is a very beautiful temple, really great monument and a must visit building for visitors. It is centrally located and easily accessible",
          "While the walk from the parking to the temple is quite a bit, the Nara Park deers kept us busy. The temple is awesome! Serene, peaceful surroundings though when we went it was extra crowded, lots of school trips and tourists! However an amazing place! Buddha\u2019s statute is huge",
          "Roving bands of uniformed elementary and middle-school students ply the walk from bus stop to temple asking foreigners questions as a school English project. They're charming! Todai-ji has the huge wooden statues at each Torii, and its approach is well-attended by deer, begging",
          "The Temple is part of a large and attractive garden, which makes for a very pleasant walk. The park also features the famous tame (and nodding/bowing) deer who are very cute. The Temple itself is impressive but similar to lots of others in Japan, just larger scale. It is the",
          "On my first visit to Nara, the rain had just abated, hundreds of people carrying umbrellas were heading toward the temple. As we arrived, paid the fee, and entered the premises the serenity of the area was the first noticeable aspect. Deer roam the garden. A washing station",
          "Somewhat of an expensive experience, but not to be missed if it's your kind of thing! Keep in mind, it doesn't last very long (unless you like to take your time and stroll around) and go as soon as it opens otherwise your experience may be dampened by a flood of tourists. The 5",

          "This place is big. You get here by walking through the South Gate. There\u2019s a somewhat steep price for admittance, but it\u2019s well worth it. I\u2019ve never seen a wooden building so big before. This also has the giant Buddha inside that you can see up close if you pay.",

          "There are an unbelievable number of shrines and temples in Japan, but this is one of the can't-miss ones. The massive Buddha statute and the surrounding statutes are really extraordinary . The $5 USD admission charge is truly nominal for the sights inside. Try your hand at the",
          "Todai-JI temple and Nara Park are the main objects of attraction of tourists in Nara. Why? The temple is considered the largest wooden structure in the world. It houses a giant bronze statue of Buddha Vairochana, the Great Buddha Todai-JI. And after all we, tourists, love \"all",

          "We took a train from Kyoto and visited Nara for a day, Dodaiji temple was our main target destination. The main Buddha statue was enormous and there are few others in the same building. it's definitely worth taking a trip. We also walk around the Nara park and enjoy the",
          "This was a fun visit because there is a pole midway through the hall where there is a hole. Apparently if you crawl through the hole it\u2019s good luck. Only children and small people can fit through though. If you like religious places it\u2019s a popular spot. Either way, you can be in",
          "It is a very busy area around the temple but a worthwhile visit. The temple, it's entrance gates and square and the buddha are huge and their are smaller temples and things to view in the surrounds. Very interesting",
          "This is one of the must sees of the area. The whole area is huge and once you enter the building, you are amazed by the big statues. They sell some souvenirs inside, which are really good price compared to other places in Japan. Totally worth it!",
          "The Todai-ji temple was built in 741 by Emperor Shomu. It is the largest wooden structure in the world that houses the massive solid bronze Daibutsusan (Great Buddha). It\u2019s 72 feet high and weighs over 550 tons. The current Buddha only represents 2/3 of the original size as it",

          "Been to Japan several times but never visited Todai-Ji until now. Boy have I missed out! Sitting in Nara park is this gem of a shrine, with it tons of deers roaming around making it even more joyous. The sheer size of the shrine and figures are hard to grasp. I appreciate the",

          "We left Kyoto for Nara as soon as the rush hour was over, but the train was heaving. The same goes for Nara and the Todai-Ji temple. It was a week day as well. Bus loads of tourists. But it was worth it as the temple is impressive. We could see why it was so popular. Suggest one",

          "We visited on a weekday, while there were perhaps not as many tourists as I expected, this was more than made up for by school children of all ages on field trips. Todai-ji also pales in comparison to Kinkakuji and similar Kyoto attractions. If you've been to those then the main",
          "This is a must see if you\u2019re in Osaka, Kyoto or Nara. It is one of the most impressive temples in terms of its size. An imposing wooden structure housing the worlds largest bronze Buddha statue. Not to be missed!",
          "Easy access from the train station. Just get the bus day pass. 600 yen entrance and I recommend the audio talk which explains the statues and grounds etc. A very old monument rich in history, the biggest wooden structure in the world! Just a good visit really- not too big!",
          "Very large and impressive Eden temple which contains many statues including a giant Buddha. Quite a long walk to reach it and there are hundreds of free roaming deer in the park. These look cute and can be very friendly.",
          "I\u2019m not Buddhist hence probably unable to appreciate the magnificence of the statue. Though impressive in itself. The history is probably more impressive than the look of actual structure as there are many similar such monuments around the world. It\u2019s still a beautiful walk in",
          "Founded in the Eighth Century, this vast World Heritage temple is the world\u2019s largest wooden building, and is a living, vibrant place of contemplation and prayer. It houses a giant 50 feet tall bronze statue of Buddha, the entry to which is protected by huge wooden 20 feet tall",

          "In my short stint in Japan, I visited temples and shrines in Osaka, Kyoto and Nara. I found Nara to be the best of the three cities because it\u2019s not wrapped up by concrete all around. In addition, another peculiarities of the city which I really liked are the deers; there are",
          "Lovely temple, beautiful vibes, lots of tourists but you still can find a quiet corner and enjoy the visit. Buddha Vairocana is one of the largest statues of Buddha in the world, the weight is 380 tons.",
          "It was built by an emperor more than a thousand years ago. He used so much bronze, that all of Japan's bronze went into this Buddha statue. There is so much bronze, you can get from level 1 smithing to 100 in runescape just by making bronze swords. I got my 10th goshuin here.",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Nara Park. We enjoyed the Nara Park, and seeing the temple was just an additional bonus. I think it is the biggest wooden building, and I think the bronze Buddha statue is the biggest in the world. Very awesome",
          "It is a whole package tour. Great temple, with beautiful park, also with pond, deers, and also pigeons. Me and my family are very satisfied",
          "Felt so much as ease seeing this temple in Nara. The temple was of a wooden structure and was pretty well maintained. Can definitely see the Chinese influence and was awed by the Giant Buddha",

          "Really amazing place with beautiful statues of buddha and others. Whole place is really great and I recommend to visit this place.",
          "We visited this temple on April 9. You have the choice of two entrance fees. One only for the main hall with the Buddha and an other one for the main hall and the museum. We did not visit the museum. This place can be very crowded at times.",
          "I personally enjoyed visiting this temple and it's one of my favourite. There is desciption in english and mandarin for tourist to understand more about the place. Worth the price. The Buddha statue in the Great Hall is mesmerizing.",
          "You cannot miss this temple if you're visiting Nara. Impressive statues of Buddha (in fact is the biggest bronze statue of Buddha in the world) and his guardians are completing this beautiful construction. The deers walking free through the surroundings makes a great atmosphere.",
          "Definitely a world heritage site, the sheer size of the buddha and its accompanying solid-gold backdrop make for a neat thing to see in person. Walking about an entirely wooden structure of such magnitude built so long ago (far before any machine help) is also impressive. It's",
          "This great big Buddha statue is amazing to see -- one of the largest of its kind. There are very few signs in English but you are allowed to take photos inside the Temple.",
          "the budha statue is amazing and there are other nice statues, it's definitely wirth the train ride from Kyoto",
          "Very easy access from Nara Park and definitely worth a visit. It is one of the more expensive temples we had visited in Japan, at 1000 yen per person but still very reasonable for the experience! A really impressive wooden structure, housing impressive statues of Buddhist",
          "Visited here while in Nara for the day. Very impressive building - especially when you realize it was built 1300 years ago. Worth a visit and a walk around. Costs \u00a5600/pp to enter but worth it. Large buddha is also interesting.",
          "Something that should be on your to do list while in Nara. There are plenty of deers in the lead up to the temple as well as tourist shops. You can get a bus there from the train station that stops at different key sites. A very impressive structure to see while spending your",
          "The bronze Budda is impressive, if it's the biggest one or not doesn't really matter. Beautiful, made the trip to Nara worth it. Loved the other statues as well, but for me the most awesome part is the wooden structure of the temple.",
          "For those people that said previously this is the biggest buddah in the world, they've obviously never been to Thailand (Big Buddah Phuket). The one there atop a mountain is visible from space and makes this temples look insignificant. That said the buddah here is beautiful.",
          "This is a wonderful historical site where there are three giant Buddah statues. The staff do give audio guides for the temple for what I believe is 500\u00a5 (500 Yen), but if you don't want to have a boring audio guide there are free guides in English up until the temple and also",
          "It is one of those touristy places that one just have to see at least once. It has great cultural and historical importance. Dimensions of the main hall, which is also the biggest wooden building in the world, are breathtaking. It pays if you choose your timing for a visit",
          "The entrance gate to the temple is huge and ornate. Cherry blossom trees line the courtyard. On the 2 sides of the entrance are 2 huge statues which represent the beginning and the end of life. The Black Buddha statue is 15 meters high and flanked by 2 golden statues of the",
          "Really very beautiful. The cherry blossoms were falling while we were here as well. As at every shrine, there were charms to buy, but they were very specific to this shrine - a lot of deer souvenirs",
          "This place is really worth getting an admission ticket and going inside. There is a giant wooden statue of Buddha inside the main hall that is unlike anything else. Really worth a visit.",
          "We probably came on the wrong moment as there were many many people around (school buses, etc.). Faire enough, but difficult to get the feel of the place, even though of course, a Very Big Buddha is very impressive. Perhaps try to figure out when the Todai-Ji temple has less",
          "A massive timber temple a large sitting Buddha inside and guardians. There\u2019s also a pillar with a hole in the base - if you can pass through, it\u2019s the path to righteousness - something like that - it\u2019s meant for children and they will love it. Of course it also attracts some",
          "The temple is extremely impressive, as might be expected of the largest wooden building in the world. With the cherry blossoms and blue skies, it feels quintessentially Japanese. The Buddha inside is huge. The place is big enough not to be ruined by the crowds. A must see.",
          "Oh my gosh! This Buddha is so huge it's almost impossible to believe. The size and scale of the original temple is breath taking. We were there during sakurai season and the cherry trees all in bloom was absolutely gorgeous. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot",
          "This is the site of the world's biggest Buddha and it is well worth the time and effort to visit. Large crowds as you would imagine, flock to this attraction and I am sure no one walks away disappointed. Really worth a visit and one not to miss if in this part of Japan.",
          "It's hard to describe the scale of the temple and Buddha. It's truly something that should be seen in person as pictures don't do it justice. Gets very busy as there are several tour buses that stop here.",
          "The biggeat wood builduing in the world that houses one of the biggest buddhas in Japan, beautiful gardens and deers all over the property",
          "The temple houses a couple of Buddha's and warriors which are huge. There is also a little quirky hole you can crawl through which a replica of the Buddha's nostril! This is apparently to give you an idea if the size, one nostril us the size of a human face and apparently to",
          "One of must visit places in Nara. Catch bus from train station. A couple minutes of walk to the temple entrance. Beautiful Japanese monument.",
          "It is a must see whether you do a day tour from Osaka or Kyoto. The area is busy but even with the large number of tourist there is plenty of space for everyone. Lots of school tours in April.",
          "Now this place is popular. If you would like to take a photo find your spot and wait a couple of minutes and your view will gradually clear and you will get that shot. The bronze statue of the Buddha is huge but you need some scale so a few people in the area will help you with",
          "This place is massive. The gate has two impressive wooden figures on each side. Then the main gallery is home of one of Japan\u2019s biggest Buddha statues. It gets really crowded but due to the size of everything is hard to miss any detail.",
          "Lovely temple, great as an addition to the Nara deer park visit. It wasn't too crowded so we were able to see everything and take some lovely pictures. Don't forget to try and go through the column on the right hand side of the temple!",
          "The outer gate to the temple complex is impressive with the two guardians at either side - Giants! After that you pay and enter the complex and the temple itself stands out. Once you get inside, you realize how large the bronze statues of Buddha is.",
          "The temple is very old with giant statue of Buddha. nicely maintained. garden is beautiful and cover a large area. Large number of Deer wandering through the garden is an added attraction.",
          "A Must-have while in Nara. The building is huge - which makes the crowds not disappear but much less noticeable.",
          "Ok so the only way to get the full experience iMHO is to get out at 7am and walk the quiet streets through the park... see the surround temples and then at 7:30 or 8 go in the main gate to see the giant Buddha with hardly anyone there! The priests were chanting and it was an",
          "We reached this temple and there were already crowds lining up to purchase the entry ticket, which we saw cost 1000yen. We took a look from the outside, and rather headed to mount wakakusa, purchased the ticket for 150 yen and hiked and relaxed for about 3 hours. This temple",
          "No matter where you go, the numbers of crowds are unavoidable especially during this peak Sakura seasons. In order to get a good picture, made your trip as early as possible to avoid the Arrival of tour groups. One could made their prayers here or just as others like me to",
          "This was an interesting temple. It's very large, but there isn't a whole lot to see inside other than the large Budda. It was still worth the few $ we spent to visit however.",
          "We didn\u2019t get to visit the amazing buddha inside, the place was very crowded, but the outside is definitely worth visiting even more so during the cherry blossoms season.",
          "After being in Kyoto you kind of get over all the temples but this is quite spectacular. Very joyful",
          "If you want to see the biggest wooden Buddha in the world, I recommend that you stay in Nara overnight and go there in the morning, before 10am (even better - before 9am). After that, a huge amount of groups will arrive, and I mean, really really really HUGE. And visiting will",
          "Paid to see the giant Buddha and it was worth it. Enormous temple, as it would be to encase a giant Buddha! Awesome sight and low cost entry. Cherry blossom too.",
          "This is probably the biggest statue of Buddha I've seen. It truly is a sight to be desired and not to be missed. A lovely peaceful place. A must do in my opinion.",
          "A huge and impressive Buddha statue! One of the biggest wooden buddha statues in the world. An interesting place !",
          "We got there after it closed so were unable to see the giant Buddha, but it was still a great place to visit!",
          "Todaiji Temple is one of the most impressive and important temples in all Japan. It's a must when you come to my home town, Nara.",
          "I have see many Buddhist temples all over the world, but this is by far the most impressive, The structure of the huge wooden building alone is something one most see. Inside there is a huge bronze Buddha statue, with a golden next to it representing the time Buddha did not",
          "You won't miss this beautiful temple if you follow the walk path along the Nara Park. There is a gate surrounded the temple, so you won't see much from outside. It is a beautiful temple with big statues, all the statues are magnificent and well detailed. Just a gentle reminder",
          "...beside the deers of course. The giant Buddha\u2019s are big, of course too. The place closes at 5, if you stay until then you will get the chance to make photos without people, but you will need to be \u201cinside\u201d since they put curtains in the main door.",
          "The Buddha statue is huge and magnificent. However, not much is explained in english. Hence, it might make sense to rent audio guide.",
          "You will learn a lot about Japan getting in the temple. All rituals are unique. The history of the temple is amazing. It is a half day tour at least!",
          "The temple is the biggest wood construction and Buddha statue in bronze in the world. Combined with the visit of the deer park makes it worth the day trip to Nara which is 90 minutes away from Kyoto. Entry cost is minimal 600 for the temple and a 1,000 if you also want to visit",
          "It takes a lot to impress me but this place does. The grandeur of the building overwhelms while peaceful. You might think you've seen all of the temples you need to see but you're wrong. This is a must.",
          "If staying in Kyoto, the temptation is not to make the one hour trip to Nara to see yet another temple! We are so pleased that we did take a morning our of the schedule to visit this remarkable structure containing several huge statues, the largest being the bronze Buddha - it",
          "Well crowded places in impressive Buddhist Temple and of course the largest wooden structure in the world. The walkway leading up to the temple is highlighted by all the friendly deer plus many shops. The local bus available outside the train station makes it very easy to get",
          "Take your time to discover this place. It has many things to offer beyond being the largest wooden temple such as a chance to test your ability to reach nirvana, many wonderful buildings and small replicas of the temple as it changed over the years.",
          "We first visited this temple in 2010, and then came back with our two boys ages 5 and 7...9 years later. Its one of our favorites and so impressive, our boys even loved it and were amazed at the large Buddha, and crawled through the pillar!",
          "Largest wooden structure, housing largest bronze statue of Buddha. Over 1300 years old. Reasonably priced entry fee considering the significance of the site. Deer roaming freely in park near site is an added bonus.",
          "This is a large Buddhist temple in Nara, which houses the largest bronze Buddha statue in the world in its main hall. The admission fee is on the high side (\u00a5600 to access the temple grounds only, without museum admission), but you'll be greeted with an impressing Buddha statue",
          "We arrived here at the end of the day having walked around Nara Park and feeling rather tired. You can see the main temple from just inside the outer entrance but have to pay (600 Yen) to enter the main temple. We were in two minds whether or not to do so as we had seen two",
          "The temple architecture itself is stunning. The statues of Buddha and Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, sitting peacefully right at the hall facing main entrance, really caught attentions - enormous and holy. The beauty of craftsmanship as well as facial expression bring true peace",
          "It\u2019s really a massive place. We payed the 600 yen each to tour inside. Grab yourself an English speaking guide to understAnd what you\u2019re looking at.",
          "So this is just another temple. *yawn*. They all look pretty much the same but this one has a giant Budda inside it. $10 will get you in to see it. To be honest unless you absolutely must see the giant Budda for yourself I'd take the $10 and go buy lunch. Other than the",
          "We were on the fence whether the 1200 yen admission for two of us would be worth it, but it was. Pictures don't do the Great Buddha justice. It is dizzingly tall and just towers over you.",
          "This temple was built in 710 - 792 AD. It is Vairocana Budddha, meaning Buddha that shines throughout the world like the sun. It serves as both a place of worship/prayer for peace and affluence on earth.",
          "When i saw the picture on google it looks like a regular temple, but in reality its a huge complex. there are also wooden imitation of how the temple got bigger over years and how it looked in the past. the buddha statue is quite unique. Lovely place",
          "We visited on a mid week day (Tuesday) and when there was light rain.I think this was a bonus in keeping the crowds away. We had minimal people to contend with and found the Buddha and the temple interesting. As we stayed in Nara a number of days we passed by on a Saturday and",
          "Different from other Shrines and Temples in Japan, this place really felt like a special place. It's worth the time to walk from the Nara train station to the temple and do the entire round of the place.",
          "Todai-ji temple is one of the most amazing places in Nara! The wooden building is simply huge as well as the statues inside it. Also, it's a place full of peace! If you go to Nara, don't skip it.",
          "Near the Nara Park is the Todai-ji temple. The Great Buddha is extremely impressive as you enter the temple. There are also a number of other Buddha's there. The entire building doesn't take too long to go through, as you walk around the sites there is no opportunity to get",
          "Can be quite busy as it's one of the main attractions. Lovely approach through the park with all of the deer.",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. The huge Buddha was unique and beautiful. Its worth a visit to experience this place. Wasn't too busy the day we went.",
          "If you like huge Buddha statues, large crowds and aggressive deers, you have come to the right place. Take you time to go around the statue, there are good spots to take pictures, and not necessarily at the front where it can get really crowded. There is a hole in a major",
          "This is a very huge and historical temple. The exterior is very grand. You will huge statues of Buddha and other Gods inside the temple. Very impressive and breathtaking. It is about a 10 minute walk from the main road to the temple. While you are walking, you will run",

          "Must visit for all tourists. It costs 600 yen to visit the Buddha Hall and an extra 400 yen for the museum. Recommend coming around 4pm to view the sunset scene. Note that this place closes at 5pm though.",
          "Been there multiple times, everytime was a greater experience than the previous. An amazing temple, a bit too crowded at times, but if you can get past that and enjoy it, it's a must see spot.",
          "Todaiji temple could be reach by using a Bus or by walking from the Kintetsu Nara Station. We chose to walk towards the temple. As we walk, we already started encountering deer roaming around the area, and even on the roads! There are a lot of deer cookie vendor scattered in the",
          "If you're wondering which temple to see near Osaka since there are so many to choose from, I'd definitely choose Todai-ji. Why? Because the trip from Osaka is easy by train, and once you're there it's a casual walk to the temple via the Nara park. Most importantly, especially",
          "Very impressed with the building. Have to see it in you own eye. Not planned to enter initially, but was attracted by it when arrived by the entrance.",
          "No photo could ever do justice to how amazing Todai-ji Temple is in person. It has been the highlight of our entire Japan experience.",
          "Generally I make it a point to visit any temple/shrine in japan if I\u2019m nearby. So during my visit to Nara park I popped by. Personally, I felt a sense of awe when arrived at the temple. It\u2019s not the most majestic of buildings, but perhaps the surroundings blending in with the",
          "We arrived at Todai-ji at 8:15 and there were only a few people. At 9:00, most of the tour buses arrive and it gets very crowded. The temple is very large, but you will need 20 minutes in the temple at a maximum. There are paths leading to many minor sites to visit.",
          "We took a day off Ky\u014dto to go to Nara and we were not disappointed. Todai-ji Temple has amazing ancient buildings with massive Buddha inside. On top you get to walk around semi-wild dears. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "I will definitely be in the minority here, but the Giant Buddha of Todai-ji Temple did absolutely nothing for me. Perhaps it was the crowds, perhaps it was the exhausting summer heat, perhaps it was the darkness inside the temple itself - all I know is I wasn't impressed at all",
          "The Toda ji Zen temple is a wonder by itself. The statue is just wonderful. The temple is just jaw dropping Never seem something so large. .",

          "This is not only the best temple to visit in Nara, it is also the busiest temple full of tour groups and school groups. However, just to experience the splendor of this temple is indeed wonderful. At the entrance to the main gate is a pond with a small shrine and some great",
          "Todaji Temple is, quite simply, spectacular. The temple building is HUGE and the statues it houses are incredible in both size and beauty. In my opinion, if you only see one thing in Nara, this has to be it.",

          "I thought the Nandai-mon gate was impressive then I saw the Daibutsu-den Hall (which is supposed to be one of the biggest wooden buildings in the world). It was incredible, I thought it was even more amazing than the Great Buddha who lives inside. A must see.",
          "Have seen many large Buddha statues, so it wasn't the first time that I was seeing one, But the outside structure where the Buddha is housed and the entire experience is well worth the effort if you have a day (or even 5 hours to spare if you are in Kyoto).",
          "Well.. There is a huge statue of Buddah. And a temple. Thats it. Cool and all but do not expect more than that.",

          "I have been here a couple of times over the last 30 years. Yes you can get a picture with the deer, after a while though they are more of a pest however the buildings, built without nails and the grounds are beautiful. A must see. Also in Nara park is the second largest Pagota",
          "When I was searching about Nara, I found this temple and go there was the best thing that I ever did in my live. It\u2019s very beautiful and very different of other temples that I went. Just a recommendation: take care with the deers in the way!! They are very cute but kinda",
          "Even if you only have a few hours to spare during you trip to Japan, go see this temple in Nara. The temple is the size of a cathedral, and made of wood. The Buddha is too large to describe - you need to see it. Pay attention to the replica lotus flower petals at ground level,",
          "Loved going in, so much respect shown to the buddhism religion. There is also a hole that kids crawl through and if you can fit through then you will receive good luck. I managed to fit through even though I'm was 19",

          "It's hard to describe in words the feeling and the emotion you'll encounter when you visit Daibutsu (Giant Buddha) at Toda-ji for the first time. I would recommend you NOT to search for too much information about or images of Daibutsu before your trip. Once arrived at Toda-ji,",

          "The temple's structural design was just amazing. It was even more amazing that the anicent japanese were able to build this temple without the current modern technology. Considering the size, it must have taken a huge amount of efforts by the ancient people to construct such a",

          "During my Kyoto stay made me so many experience to visit famous temples so far, but it was totally different scale. I can not believe the temple made without nails. Ancient Japanese people was super smart to build the kind of architecture. Gigantic Buddha is waiting for you",

          "Visited this temple during the Osaka summer, and there were several school children on excursion as well. The view of the temple from the front gate is grand, and even more awesome when you realize the entire structure is made of wood. Do ask for a guide (free) for a brief",

Sorry but on the down side we walked all around the park feeding the deer and saw the temple and was starving hungry \u201cnot a great deal to",
          "One of my favourite places during my visit to Japan. I would definitely recommend to have a day visit to Nara",
          "We ranked this as #1 destination during our vacation in June. The place and the Buddha are huge! The temple was, I believe, constructed in 752 and as you enter the gates, you will see the guardians that are as tall as a two story building. If you are traveling during summer",

        "wiki": "Isui-en (\u4f9d\u6c34\u5712, Isuien) is a  Japanese garden located in Nara, the old capital of Japan near Ky\u014dto.  It has been preserved since its creation in the Meiji era, and is the only walking garden (kaiyushiki teien) in Nara. It is divided into two sections, which were originally two separate gardens, and each features a pagoda.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site of the western garden originally formed part of Manishu-in, a minor temple which was part of the larger temple of Kofuku-ji. The ground was bought in the 1670, during the Enp\u014d era by Kiyosumi Michikiyo, a wealthy tanner. He restructured the gardens between 1673 and 1681 and built two houses: the Sanshu-tei and Tei-shu-Ken, as the family home.  These were built with thatched roofs. The name Sanshu-tei (\u201chouse of the three wonders\u201d) was given by Mokuan, the large priest of the Manpuku-ji temple of the school Zen Oubaku with Uji.\nThe larger eastern garden dates from 1899 and was designed by Seki Tojiro, a Nara businessman. Tojiro hired for the redesign Horitoku, a garden architect from the school of Urasenke.\nIn 1939, the two gardens were bought and combined by Jyunsaku Nakamura, a merchant of Nara, to provide a site for the attached Neiraku Museum (\u5be7\u697d\u7f8e\u8853\u9928), which hosts a collection of traditional Japanese ceramics.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe gardens cover roughly 145,000 square feet (13,500 m2).\nIn the central pond of the gardens, there are two islands with sculptures of a crane and tortoise. In Japanese culture these animals represent longevity.\nThe house of the Hyoshin-tei, along with the west pool, were designed by Kimura Seibei, another garden architect from Urasenke. It allows access of the house by using a technique called shakkei, or \"borrowed landscape.\" The composition of the landscape incorporates the roof of the large southern door (Nandaimon) of the temple T\u014ddai-ji, as well as the three higher hills overhanging Nara: the mounts Wakakusa, Kasuga, and Mikasa. It is framed by the trees of the Himuro sanctuary in the south, and the T\u014ddai-ji temple in the north. These make the space between the garden and background seem to disappear, producing a continuity which makes the landscape blend in visual harmony. This harmony is reinforced by the absence of any artificial enclosure.\nThe shape of the pond represents the shape of the kanji \u6c34 character for mizu (\u201cwater\u201d). A central island is connected to the bank by a series of stepping stones, which were formerly used to grind the pigments used in dyeing. The garden also contains decorative stones, which were popular during the Meiji era. The water is fed by the Yosiki river, which flows adjacent to the garden.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMansfield, Stephen (2011).

          "I loved these gardens - really peacful and very well kept, it is a bit pricey but they offer free tours of the garden which are done by volunteers who are very well informed about the whole area. If you want somewhere to get social media pictures or family snaps then this place",
          "The gardens were pleasant but much smaller than I was expecting. Also the museum was also small and not very interesting especially for non-Japanese speakers. At \u00a5900, I thought it was very expensive especially compared to the other main sights in Nara.",
          "This is the best park. There is a breathtaking view in the park that I cant stop thinking about. Quiet and not as crowded as the rest of the city. I would really like to come back in spring or fall.",
          "With a reduced rate for foreigners, if you like Japanese gardens this one is better than the neighboring Yoshiki-en garden. It's about half an hour to wander around and enjoy the ambience. There are several tea houses in the gardens and I believe you can book in for a ceremony.",

          "Even on a June Sunday with Todai-ji and the surrounding parks so overrun with crowds the deer had given up hassling for food, Isuien was a peaceful oasis, with barely a sound creeping in from outside, and just a few dozen people strolling the grounds. The gardens here are",
          "Perhaps because it requires an entrance fee, this garden is untarnished by the touristy crowds outside. For the \u00a5900 I was offered a free English guide around the garden which I learnt a lot from about Japanese landscaping and culture. The garden is quintessentially Japanese",
          "Went on a visit to Nara, very peaceful and beautiful. One of my favorite parks in Japan. Not crowded so you could take your time wandering around. Lovely visit",
          "What a lovely garden to sit and relax in total calmness. You can walk round and it is very quiet and serene. There is a tea room where you can get tea or lunch and sit looking out over the garden. The garden covers nearly three acres. There are two strolling around the pond",

          "There are two different styles of japanese gardens in Nara right next door to each other and both are worth visiting - Isuien was my favourite as there was a lovely lake/river there and varying examples of japanese gardening around it. The sun was out and we found ourselves in",
          "We could see how these gardens would be beautiful in season but we visited in winter and they were dry and brown. On the way out we ran into a man working at the gardens who told us in spring the cherry blossoms are beautiful to see, in summer everything is green and flowering",

          "We visited the garden during winter-time. The main garden was closed but we were allowed into a smaller segment. Foreign visitors get to enter for free. Not the best time to visit a garden during winter but the place still exudes serenity. Quite scenic despite bare trees.",
          "Passby the place while walking towards Nara park , the free entrance entice me to check the place out . Nice place to slowly explore the place within 20mins, not many visitors as it is slightly off the main road to Nara park .",
          "While the Deer Park in Nara boasts the most friendly animals. Isuien Gardens provides a tranquil serenity in a busy city setting. We were fortunate to meet a docent at the entrance who explained the gardens layout, intricacies and meaning. He provided a great background history",
          "If you travel to Nara please don't miss this beautiful garden with it's beautiful colours, streams, stepping stones and ponds with the most amazing reflections. If you can, get one of the garden guides to show you around, they are a mine of information about the garden layout",
          "We were in for some diversity after a string of temples, so we paid to visit the garden, which was advertised with splendid photographs through town. We were not disappointed. If we would have had more time we might have tried the tea ceremony, but the garden with tea houses",
          "I visited under the rain, and it did not lose its enchantment. Don't miss also the next door YOSHIKIEN Garden",
          "The front garden is beautifully landscaped and it gradually becomes less designed as you move through the back garden to the outer edges. The autumn colours of the Acers and Enkianthus were stunning as they were reflected in the ponds. The various tea houses were well",

          "This is the most scenic garden we visited in Japan. In November it glows with red leaves of Enkianthus and Japanese Maples. It has dynamic topography on nearly three acres encompassing two ponds, islands, water wheel and waterfall. One can enjoy lunch at the Tea house and stroll",
          "Beautiful and relaxing park for walking and admiring the view over the mountains and the greenery. Calm and pretty. You can also have tea in the tea house in the park.",
          "This garden has all the expected features of a traditional Japanese garden: pond and rills, clipped maples, stepping stones, lanterns and teahouses. It was lovely even in the rain. Watch out for the stones with cord wrapping - they mean no entry! We didn't go in the small",
          "The garden is beautiful and its entrance fee miraculously deters the crowds that would ruin it. It was particularly appreciated as Nara's main sites are overrun by visitors. The museum was dull - specialising in seals, as in company seals, it was not well enough displayed to be",
          "Beautiful traditional japanese garden, in two parts. We were offered a free tour from a volunteer who was practicing his English and it was great to learn from and converse with him.",
          "We did enjoy this garden but somehow it left us a bit flat. We liked the next door, smaller, and more dramatic Yoshikien garden which also was free with foreign ID (passport...) better.",
          "Beautiful garden built around a tea house and of course a few minutes walk from the temple which is the largest wooden structure in the world. We were unfortunate in that it was very cloudy but on a sunny day would be magnificent. Adjacent to it is a small museum which was",
          "big thanks to tsutomu from nara ymca english goodwill tours,met by accident at nara rail station and given a free 5 hour walking tour of nara,visited most of the sights including Isuien Garden, one of the best days i had in japan. would visit again in spring or autumn though,as",
          "We were greeted by a volunteer who gave us a quick 10 min intro to the garden which was great! The whole garden is so pretty and tranquil, i preferred this to some of the bigger more \"commercialised\" gardens we saw in other parts of Japan.",
          "I still cannot believe I paid \u00a5900 to visit this small, mediocre garden, which looks quite neglected. They are certainly not using this high entrance fee for the maintenance of the park. Quite frankly, it would not deserve a visit even if it were a free entrance. Major",
          "Isuien garden is one of the most beautiful example of Japanese gardening art. Entrance fee a little bit higher than usual temple or museum entrance fees, however it is a place which offers to enjoy tea time in a real japanese garden :)",
          "An absolutely beautiful garden, something I would like to see during all four season changes. Lovely piece of history and nurture of the centuries. A must visit spot during your time in Nara. This was my highlight this trip.",
          "We went during Summer and it was so green and beautiful! Free guides are available. It's hard to find. You'll have to walk between a long walkways with a yellow wall and brown wall.",
          "If you're visiting Nara Park you will almost certainly wander through or past Isui-en Garden. It is attractive but would not be worth a special trip itself.",
          "it's a small and lovely garden to walk around, definetly worth paying the small entrance fee. also around great place to enjoy a cup of green tea.",
          "We chose to go to this garden before the deer city and arrived at 10am. The garden entrance was 900yen each and got you entrance to the garden and the museum next door. Arriving at 10 was perfect as we missed all of the tour groups and pretty much walked around with a volenteer",
          "A relatively small and peaceful garden with lots to enjoy - particularly borrowed scenery and ponds. Surprisingly not that busy and highly recommend as a quick and easy visit on the way from train/centre to Todaji. The little museum which is included in ticket is only so/so",
          "My wife and I found this garden to be between ok and nice, certainly not worth the 1200 yen each for entry. Save your money and your legs getting there.",
          "This is a beautiful garden (s) for a peaceful stroll with the mountain in the background. If you are a gardener yourself you will certainly take away many ideas with you. You will find a few welcome moments of peace if you just sit a while and soak it all in.",
          "A beautiful, tranquil zen garden definitely worth a detour for a quiet wander. Lovely moss patchworks.",
          "Both the garden and the museum that comes with the entrance fee were quite disappointing. Having visited a number of Japanese gardens already, Isuien appeared to be somewhat neglected, which detracts from the beautiful landscaping. The Yoshiki-en garden next door was better",
          "We loved strolling through this Japanese garden! So many special zen places! The garden was spectacular in the late spring but I have seen pictures of it in the fall when it is just as remarkable. A must see if you are visiting Nara and very close to Nara Park.",
          "Must say, this was the best surprise of the day. It was raining a little, so we decided to stay for a minute. And it was wonderful. We struck the wooden gong for service and ordered two large beers while our baby crawled across the floor. It was more expensive than other gardens",
          "We visited Isuien Garden in January and it was a cold day but the garden warmed our hearts and we soon forgot how cold the day was as we viewed this amazing example of a Japanese garden. Fortunately because of the time of year there were few people around and we had the whole",
          "It's well organised and full of beautifully trimmed trees and plants. Water, moss, pebbles. It's quintessentially Japanese. Take your time here whatever you do.",
          "round the corner from the Great Buddha we were greeted by a volunteer guide who offered to take us around. this is a borrowed garden with views of the surrounding mountains and temple visible through the trees. pretty ponds and teahouse",
          "A Japanese Garden, really well-maintained. Visit in different seasons to enjoy the different feel, as the foliage changes colors. Relaxing and calm atmosphere.",
          "The garden was one of my favourite gardens that I visited on my trip to Japan. It's only a short walk from the Todai-ji and though relatively small in size, is definitely worth a visit. There is also a small museum opposite the gardens which you can skip if you are short on",
          "One of the most iconic landscape of Japan, this garden represent all the beauty you can find in Japan. It is a must visit if you come to Nara.",
          "The Isuien Garden is about 10 minutes walking distance west of the Nandaimon Gate of the Todai-ji temple and covers nearly 3 acres. The garden is a combination of front garden- built in 1670's by Kiyosumi Dosei and back garden - designed by Seki Tojiro in early 20th century.",
          "We visited this garden 3 years ago and wanted to visit again. BUT, the garden is closed to the public whilst reconstruction is done. Visit Yoshikien next door which is free to foreigners.",
          "It is one of the most beautiful gardens (especially when the leaves turn red) we have seen on out trip, very tranquil. Isuien garden is located West of the Nandaimon Gate of the Todai-ji temple. The front garden is designed in the Edo period and the back garden is designed in",
          "There are reasons why this is classified as one of the country's most beautiful gardens. This private garden can be visited but at cost of 900 yen. In my opinion, it is worth the money. For the few that have rated this a poor attraction, it is apparent that they have missed",
          "It is the most tranquil place we've been on this trip. There aren't a bus load of tourist like in other attractions. You can spend time taking in the sights in the back and front gardens. Its well worth the 900Yen entrance fee",
          "Nice small Japanese garden for couple of hours. The guide explained us about the small buildings or place where tea ceremony is done. This was a private garden earlier now available for public. Many places to take a perfect photo especially during autumn. Good place to visit if",
          "These gardens are well worth the 900 yen to gain entrance. They are tranquil and in the late fall the colours are beautiful. The waterfalls are peaceful. I would skip the museum but the Isuien Garden is a good way to start your visit to Nara.",
          "You imagine a Japanese garden in the fall and then you get lucky and visit Japan during peak fall season. It's a gardener and a photographer's paradise - there's a fabulous photo op at every turn. I know many people come to Japan to see cherry blossoms in the spring but it is",
          "Isuien is a gem of a garden. Every which way you turn, there is something beautiful and interesting to see. The garden is wonderfully sculpted, and the autumn colours are stunning. We had a photograph of a whole backdrop of red maple leaves. The garden path is well-marked, with",
          "Two minutes after deciding not to pay $18 for two of us to view another garden, we found Isuien-free to International tourists. It was absolutely stunning. The flowers were not in bloom up in the floral garden, but we were there in peak leaf changing season in a bit of rain in",
          "We went to Japan for the autumn leaves photography and we were not disappointed our expectations were exceeded.This garden was amazing not many tourist in the garden during our visit. They are sometimes shut on Tuesdays so check at tourist office before you go. Cost expensive",
          "Don't go home from Nara if you haven't visit this place. This Garden is simply breathtaking. The garden is very beautiful and peaceful. There's a caf\u00e9 shop that overlooks the garden wherein you can order coffee, tea or even beer and appreciate the beauty and peacefulness of",
          "If you want to see a truly beautiful Japanese garden don't miss this one There is a free garden next door called the Japanese garden it is worth seeing both Also there are free guides very helpful",
          "Isuien Garden is a beautiful garden well worth its entrance fee. It is a rather large garden and also has a teahouse / restaurant at its premises. Take your time in strolling around.",
          "This was probably the loveliest garden we visited in our two weeks in Japan. It's a strolling garden that uses 'borrowed sceney' ie elements outside the garden as part of the view. There are ponds and streams, moss gardens and little shrines and tea houses. We were lucky enough",
          "Here is one of those gardening gems for which Japan is so rightly famous. This garden and the similar once next to it (free entry) are themselves alone worth the trip to Nara. The extremely detailed use of all the natural elements to create such beauty and harmony is",
          "A very nice example of old Japanese garden. We were lucky to visit it in Autumn when trees are colorful. It worth a visit.",
          "This garden is the one place you must visit if you go to Nara. Very beautiful, quiet, and large enough to wander around for a good hour. Entrance fee is \u00a5900, also including the museum (not much to see though).",
          "This was the highlight of our day trip to Nara. Todaiji is a must see of course, but was very crowded. This on the other hand was pretty, quiet and serene. There's an area with a few benches where one can sit and enjoy the scenery and atmosphere for a bit. Highly recommended.",
          "There are many gardens and parks throughout Japan and this puts them all to shame. An absolutely beautiful stroll, I had a free tour guide tell me about the front and back garden so that helped add to experience. It was gorgeous when I went with some of the trees turning to red",
          "Isuien Garden is a must-see if you're in Nara. It's the only walking garden in Nara and it's beautifully preserved. They charge an admission fee of about 900JPY but the scenery is worth it.",
          "A very large and well-known garden in Nara. A visit requires a couple of hours to complete what is essentially a loop track to appreciate the multiple features here that include tea houses, picturesque bridges over water features and lovely ponds. A visit in November, which",
          "Great garden which will look stunning in autumn. Enjoyed a lovely stroll through the garden. Filled with small patches of moss, delightful!",
          "My great regret is that I visited at the start of October rather than towards the end of October. The leaves on a few of the trees were just starting to turn, but I could see it would be spectacular when the leaves are changing fully. It's a very pretty and charming garden,",
          "Really lovely quiet garden with windy paths and good views. It's free for foreigners and the lady at the reception was polite.",
          "We happened upon this garden on a day trip to Nara. Much of the park was swarmed with people (and deer), so this garden was a welcome break from the crowds. Well worth the $8 fee (810 yen since the museum was closed that day). The garden was well-kept and had small signs with",
          "We had just had an interesting trip to the impressive big golden buddha after dodging deer in the park (as an aside, they are fine - not a problem, and it is quite funny watching them cross the zebra crossing, obeying the lights)! It was a hot day and this lovely garden with its",
          "The front garden was built in the 1670s by a wealthy cloth merchant whilst the rear section was built in the 20th century in order to allow tea ceremonies. Both have the perfect sense of harmony and with the mountains and Todaiji temple as a backdrop they are superb and very",
          "If you are tight on time, go to yoshiki en garden next door. It's free for foreigners (show passport) instead of y900 here. It's smaller but similar.",
          "I love Japanese gardens, so this was a must for me to visit. In your ticket, there is a guide included who walks you through the garden, tells you its history and also some information about plants, garden architecture and carps. I very much enjoyed.",
          "The beautiful, manicured gardens are not large but are a great place to escape the crowds, sit and have a few moments of peace. They are also cool, even on a hot, steamy day. The museum is very small and does not house much of great interest. If you are on a strict budget,",
          "Compare to the Great Buddha of Todaiji temple and over crowded photo shooting with deers in Nara park, this is the place where one can enjoy the peace and atmosphere of Zen. One can enjoy tasty ice-cream in the tea house overlooking the garden. For ones who has difficulties to",
          "We were completely charmed by this elegant and refined garden. We learned a lot from an EGG (English Goodwill Guide) who talked about the history, design, and plants.",
          "Very beautiful gardens within walking distance from Nara Park. Not free but worth seeing. Earlier in the morning right when the open is usually best to avoid mosquitos.",
          "A tranquil garden close to highways and residences. Masterful creation of separate spaces, each with the sound of water and beautiful vistas. Entrance fee (about $10) also includes a small museum with a lovely collection of celadon ceramics (mostly Korean).",
          "This was quite a nice garden, and on the way to Todaiji temple. Beautiful and peaceful but not necessarily unique or the best among Japanese gardens. Not a must see for the admission price of 900 yen, which is on the high side compared to other attractions.",
          "We spent about an hour here after walking about 15 minutes from Nara Park. There were hardly visitor when we were there so we strolled leisurely around the garden. It was tranquil and quite beautiful. If you have an extra hour, it is worth the time to visit Isuien Garden.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, this was one of the most beautiful settings in Japan. There were no crowds and it is a peaceful, lovely and historical garden.",
          "More intimate than the larger public gardens. Lovely layout and planting with good borrowed landscape of the buildings in Nara park such as Nandai-mon gate, and the surrounding hills.",
          "A beautiful and quiet Japanese garden with two ponds, nicely trimmed trees and thatched roofs buildings serving as tea houses or old rest houses. You can have a Japanese tea in the tea house while admiring the landscape sitting on tatami mats. The many maple trees make it",
          "We were walking from Gangoji Temple to Todaiji Temple and happened to pass the entrance to this garden. We were looking for somewhere to rest in some quiet away from the crowds in Nara that day - so we popped into the garden. It was beautiful. Well landscaped and quiet. Far",
          "This was a beautiful traditional garden in the heart of Nara. It was not very crowded because of the entrance fee. If you are a fan of gardens, then you will want to see this.",
          "We had just visited the Temple and Buddha in Nara, which was absolutely packed with school trips. We had decided to seek out this garden. We were almost put off by the 900 yen entrance fee, but were glad we weren't. Compared to the crowds in the park and the temple, this was",
          "Glorious 400 year old garden that is an absolute delight. The entry price is steep at 900 yen but it was the most perfect example of a Japanese garden that we saw on our trip.",
          "We visited this garden early in the morning on our side trip to Nara. The price is a bit steep (900 yen for adults), but I think it was worth the price. The garden was absolutely stunning, and there were very few other visitors (most likely due to the steep price). If you want",
          "Isuien is a nice Japanese Garden close to the Todai-ji Temple in Nara. There are 2 parts of the garden, one made in Edo period (17th century) and the other made in Meiji period (19th century). The entrance fee is a little bit expensive(900 yen), but it's worth visiting this",
          "It is without doubt a beautiful garden. The attached museum is not really worth wasting time on. You can see part of it already by taking a tea in the neighbouring tea house without paying the entrance fee. There is another free garden yoshiki-en just beside it. I actually liked",
          "We were apprehensive in paying the 900 yen entrance fee, but the tourist information center staff told us this is \"the most highly rated garden in all of Japan by tourists\". It's underwhelming, and even if it was free - the time isn't worth it if you're doing a day trip from",
          "Very high entrance fee as they only sell a combo ticket with the next door shocker of a museum. The gardens are nice and some decent pictures can be taken, but it is very small and not in any way worth the money.",
          "A short distance from Todai-ji Temple is the Isuien Garden, which is often ignored by tourists in preference for the more famous temple. The gardens are incredibly peaceful and picturesque, and the staff are very helpful, with one even offering a free tour in English. If you",
          "The entrance fee was surprisingly high (900 yen, but that day the inside museum was closed so only 810 yen, still very expensive), so my expectations rose drastically. The garden couldn't reach them because it's true that it is quite nice but I didn't feel the awe I longed for.",
          "Nice, quiet and scenic garden but nowhere near stunning. Nothing special about this garden especially given the entrance fee required (\u00a5820). However, it might be more scenic during late autumn.",
          "Although there is an entrance fee, it is worth paying it. There are some volunteers who explain the history of the gardens. It is a peaceful and wonderful place.",
          "One reviewer complained about the entrance fee. I think it's fair, and it certainly keeps the numbers down which means those that pay and enter have a relatively peaceful garden to enjoy. Wonderful colour when we were there in April, and lots of good photos taken.",
          "It was really peaceful and relaxing, the garden is beautiful. I wish I could visit it again. Worth it!",
          "Stopped here on the way to Nara Park and temple area. We were greeted and offered a free Guide to show us around the gardens. The area is beautifully kept and peaceful",
          "The entrance fee to this garden is 900Yen per adult. It is not value for money and the plants and landscape there is not that great. There are sign board all over stating please do not step on the moses. Quite annoying. There is a garden next door which is free to tourist.",
          "Don't skip this one, it was the highlight of our Nara visit to see the two gardens.It is also very quiet in there even though Tennoji was packed with people. You can sit in peace and harmony and take in the scenery. The amount of detail within the gardens is a marvel to behold-",
          "This zen garden was fun to visit and very beautiful. We were guided around it by a volunteer who spoke surprisingly good English so were able to learn more specific reasons for its current design. I highly recommend you ask about that. It is small though and can probably be in",
          "I was so surprised seeing how peaceful and calm Nara was, not many tourist at all BUT the scenery ommgg so beautiful it does not lose to Kyoto at all! when i first step into Isuien garden i was just mesmerised seeing how well and beautiful they maintained the garden...the autumn",
          "It's a beautiful garden. What can I say. I visited the garden on Oct of 2015, Thursday morning. There were 4 people in the garden besides me when I visited. There was a volunteer guide who spoke English who gave me a private tour and explained to me things that I'd never",
          "Unfortunately it was raining the day I went to see the Isuien Garden but that didn't take away from how beautiful and breathtaking this garden is. Seeing the trees turning brown, red and yellow was a beautiful sight! The walking paths give you opportunities to take perfect",
          "Most landscape in Japan is awe-inspiring but the beauty of the Isuien is that if you visit it first thing in the morning, you might be one of the few people there and enjoy the lovely landscape in solitude. A must visit in Nara!",
          "Less crowded than the other attractions of Nara even on a Sunday morning. Not so easy to find so ask a policeman to find the left hand turn off the main street. Very peaceful walk to get there. BTW there is wonderful free garden next door to the right. free to any non-Japanese,",
          "This is a lovely garden to look at before you hit the big temples! There were free English speaking guides to talk to you about the history of the place, and they take your photo with your camera! About the only pics I'm in! It costs to get in, but you also get to visit the",
          "when we visited the gardens were really quiet, most toruists only get to see the bronze buddha so this is a ideal get away from the crowds location, lovely place to rest",
          "This garden is a hidden gem in Nara Park. It is such a beautiful garden, but there was hardly anyone there. I suppose most people visit the major attractions first. We visited this spot on our second day and were rewarded with the visit. The adjoining Neiraku Art Museum included",
          "Quite a large garden, lots to explore, very peaceful and a good contrast to the busyness of the Toshodaiji complex.",
          "the entire garden is superbly landscaped! great picture opportunity! lots of flowers and very serene!",
          "A lovely garden situated just at the fringe of Nara Park. It has a nice pond and one can take lots of pictures with Todai-ji Temple as the background.",
          "Out of all the sites we've visited, Isuien garden is my favourite. It has such a beautiful layout besides just the main garden view. Well worth also walking along all the other small paths throughout the garden. This should be on everyones list to visit in Nara! Entry fee is a",
          "Walking distance from Toda-ji Temple, this garden is well worth a visit. Most tourists visiting nearby Today-ji bypass this in their rush. That's good news for the traveller with more time to enjoy the garden. There's a museum on site that is also well worth a visit. Local",
          "It was so peaceful to walk in this garden with such a beautiful view that was feast for your eyes. Everything is carefully maintained but the effort was not too apparent and it gave natural feel to this place. I was there in the beginning of autumn so the leaves have started to",
          "This was our first stop on our trip to Nara. What a lovely garden it is! There were stunning vistas, with some leaves just beginning to change. There was a lovely pond with stepping stones to one side of a small island and a stone bridge to the other side. This was a more open",
          "Having death with the hustle bustle of the park and the Temples, entering this garden was truly a new universe. It is hard to envision yourself I. An urban landscape when at every turn there is yet another perfectly reflected tree or naturally sculpted rise. Could could have",
          "Isuien is a combination of two gardens. The Front Garden was designed during the Edo period while the Back Garden was designed during the Meiji era. Both gardens have ponds and tea houses, and excellent views. The Back garden, for example, also gives a view of the Todaiji\u2019s",
          "I understand that the original garden was designed and built in the 17th Century, it was modernized in the 20th century, on several acres and the Japanese government turned it into a spectacular site, with easy to manage walks, an incredible variety of trees -- I especially",
          "We found this little gem very enchanting and just beautiful. Way better than eg the famous Okayama garden. Isuien has it all, a pond, waterfall, tea house and more. With 3000 jpy a bit expensive especially for a family of 4. If you are not a garden fanatic , visit the free",
          "Located Near Nara park you find this garden. Decorated in Japanese style two small ponds form the center. Quiet and peaceful to stay here for a while",
          "This was my second time here and the garden is impeccable with fantastic landscaping. Every area was well thought out, picturesque, and breathtaking. Take the free English speaking guide tour and learn about the long rich history of this garden. The guide shared interesting",
          "I walked 15 minutes to get here from Todaiji Temple, finished strolling around the garden in 20 minutes. The lake in the middle is the main highlight, try to go early in the morning to get good pictures when the sunlight is not so harsh. There is small traditional restaurant",
          "If the Nara crowds at Todai-ji have worn you down, Isuien Garden is a good place to recover your tranquility. It's a beautiful garden walk, with several ponds and streams, a functioning tea house, and, for an added bonus, a museum housing some very nice ceramic pieces, exquisite",
          "Beautiful garden, a bit small and there are nicer gardens elsewhere in Japan but if you are in Nara for a day and have time then it is worth going. Next door there is another garden and is free for foreigners.",
          "Beautiful Japanese garden at Nara.the garden is divided in two parts, and were built in two different periods - the Edo period and the Meiji era. The front garden is smaller, but very pretty and serene. The back garden is built around a large lake. Unfortunately, the art",
          "If you love gardens, you'll like this place. I love gardens so I enjoyed the walk around the garden. However, if you are neutral to gardens like my husband, the 900Yen entrance fee is rather pricey compared to the other entrance fees we paid in Kyoto and Nara. We didn't stay",
          "This garden offers a peaceful moment of rest between the visits to the temples, there are very beautiful views, great for nice pictures, you can walk around or just sit and enjoy the silence and the view. Not particularly interest in the nearby museum.",
          "One of the gardens you can visit in Nara park. We were lucky that there are a couple of very nice Japanese elderly who offered to gave us a tour of the garden, which made us fully appreciate the design and the history of the place.",
          "We found this place recommended in the guidebook. It was quite tricky to find, and we almost gave up at one point... We were very glad we didn't. It was our favourite spot in Nara, tranquil, spiritual and painstakingly well maintained. Not as popular as the main attractions, but",
          "We were here on a hot day in summer. A little disappointed that there wasn't much blooming, but still worth a 30 minute walk through to get away from the world.",
          "The best Japanese Garden we have seen in this trip, we have been to Osaka, Nara, Kobe, Kyoto, Tokyo, this Isuien Garden has all the Japanese tea Garden feature in one. It is not easy to find Isuien, it is so close to Todaiji Temple, but no signs to direct you, have to ask",
          "Really don't understand why this garden is rated so high, there are way better gardens in the Kansai area. Maybe because we visited in June, but still, in the fall or spring other places would be prettier too. Anyways, I thought the Manyo/Shinen Botanical garden was more",
          "This was one of the most beautiful gardens we saw on our trip - and we saw a lot of gardens! It is not a huge garden but big enough to spend maybe up to an hour wandering around. There are two large ponds, front and back with fabulous landscaping, trees, shrubs, rock features",
          "My wife and two sons visited back in April. We spent around an hour here before going over towards Todai-Ji. The garden is beautiful and picturesque. We were fortunate enough to have a tour guide show us around (free of charge and refused to take payment!) and he was very",

          "Isuien is located in central Nara and is divided into two parts, a front garden and a rear garden, with a number of tea houses, streams, waterfalls, and ponds scattered throughout. The front garden has a longer history, dating back to the early Edo period. The rear garden, the",
          "This garden can be easily done in half an hour. Its very close to nara deer park so we decided to stop by. It may be small but it is stunningly beautiful. yes the 900Y fee is steep but the work that goes into this garden does make it worth it.",
          "I wouldn't understand somebody who doesn't like this garden. Quintessential Japanese garden. Perfection.",
          "If you want to visit a typical Japanese garden you should definitely visit Isuien Garden. The entrance fee is quite expensive with 900 Yen but worth. You can see all the tree mountains around Nara from this Garden. You should sit down for a moment and enjoy the view and the",
          "Gardeners work hard but don't overwork the garden; weeds are kept down but the other plants are allowed to grow just a bit wild. It makes for a really lovely result.",

        "wiki": "Isonokami Shrine (\u77f3\u4e0a\u795e\u5bae, Isonokami-jing\u016b, also Isonokami-futsu-no-mitama-jinja (\u77f3\u4e0a\u5e03\u90fd\u5fa1\u9b42\u795e\u793e), Furu-\u014dmyojin (\u5e03\u7559\u5927\u660e\u795e) etc.) is a Shinto shrine located in the hills of Furu in Tenri, Nara prefecture, Japan. It is one of the oldest extant Shinto shrines in Japan and has housed several significant artifacts.\nIsonokami shrine was highly regarded in the ancient era, and frequented by many members of the Imperial Family. It played a pivotal role in Japan's early history, especially during the 3rd to 5th centuries.\nThe shrine is at the northern end of the Yamanobe no michi, the oldest road in Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is unknown which kami was initially worshipped at Isonokami shrine. Isonokami Shrine was supposedly built in the 7th year of Emperor Sujin's reign, or the 91 BC. However, there is little record of Sujin's existence or identity, and therefore the claim is deemed legendary. The construction of a structure that can be identified as a Shinto shrine in the Isonokami area probably dates two or three centuries later.  Despite this, it is not unlikely that the Isonokami area was considered a sacred site during that time, as archeological digs have found many ritual objects, and Isonokami worship was already firmly established when they were adopted by the Yamato leaders in the 4th century.\nEarly records show that the shrine was an emerging center of Yamato power, flavored with a military overtone. Archeological evidences shows that around the 4th century, Yamato kings and nobility constructed more and more palaces and buildings in the shrine's vicinity.  Prior to this, the Yamato leaders identified with kami worshipped at Mount Miwa, but may have turned to Isonokami for its martial implications.  Myths written in the Nihon Shoki clearly attempt to link the Yamato court to Isonokami shrine.  According to the Nihon Shoki, Emperor Suinin's eldest son, Prince Inishiki ordered a thousand swords made and was placed in charge of Isonokami's treasures.  He then founded the Mononobe clan, who patronized the shrine for many generations.  Indeed, many of the state's iron weaponry were kept in the shrine's storehouses.  When the Mononobe clan collapsed, it was reformed as the Isonokami clan.\nThe shrine became the object of Imperial patronage during the early Heian period.  In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered that Imperial messengers be sent to report important events to the guardian kami of Japan. These heihaku were initially presented to 16 shrines including the Isonokami Shrine.From 1871 through 1946, the Isonokami Shrine was officially designated one of the Kanpei-taisha (\u5b98\u5e63\u5927\u793e), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nIsonokami shrine is surrounded by Cryptomeria (sugi), and is known for its quiet solemnity. A waka poem from the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b anthology mentions Isonokami shrine, surrounded by holy cedar trees.\nThe current site of Isonokami shrine may have been the site of an earlier religious structure, the Izumo-taisha. This is suspected because of a secondary shrine to Izumo-takeo found near the main shrine, but on higher ground.  Since secondary shrines are never built higher than the principal shrine, some have concluded that it was an older structure that stood before the current one.\nThe honden, or main hall, is built in the nagare-zukuri style.\n\n\n== Enshrined ==\nThe main enshrined dedication is to Futsu-no-mitama (\u5e03\u90fd\u5fa1\u9b42), the kami of a legendary sword (futsu-no-mitama-no-tsurugi) that was given to by Takemikazuchi in Kumano and used by Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan.  However, the sword itself is hidden in Isonokami shrine, but the second sword is visible in Kashima Shrine, Ibaraki.\n\n\n== Artifacts ==\n\nThe Nanatsusaya-no-Tachi, a seven-branched sword, is housed in Isonokami shrine. It was given to the Yamato king by the crown prince of Baekje, a kingdom on the Korean Peninsula. The sword has been kept in Isonokami shrine since ancient times, perhaps as early as the 4th century when it was received from Baekje. It was rediscovered in 1873, and its gold inlaid inscription has proven to be a valuable historical resource. The sword is currently not available for public viewing.\nThe Totsuka-no-Tsurugi, a legendary sword, is also said to be kept at Isonokami shrine. According to the Kojiki, the sword was used by the god Susanoo to slay the Yamata-no-Orochi, a giant serpent with eight heads and eight tails. Priests at the shrine do not allow anyone to see or inspect the sword.\nTen treasures brought by Amenohiboko are thought to be housed in Isonokami shrine. According to the Nihon Shoki, Amenohiboko was a prince from Korea who settled in Japan. The ten treasures he brought are known as the Tokusa-no-Kandakara, and they are as follows:\n\nOkitsu-kagami (A mirror)\nHetsu-kagami (A mirror)\nYatsuka-no-tsurugi (A sword)\nIku-tama (A jewel)\nMakarukaheshi-tama (A jewel)\nTaru-tama (A jewel)\nChikaheshi-no-tama (A jewel)\nOrochi-no-hire (A type of long scarf worn by women)\nHachi-no-hire (A type of long scarf worn by women)\nKusagusa-no-mono-no-hire (A type of long scarf worn by women)\n\n\n== National Treasures ==\n\n\n=== National Treasures of Japan ===\nThe haiden, or hall of worship, with irimoya style roofing, Kamakura period\nThe haiden at the Izumo Takeo secondary shrine\nThe Nanatsusaya-no-Tachi\n\n\n=== Important Cultural Properties ===\nThe r\u014dmon, or main gate\nTwo iron shields from the Kofun period\nSeveral pieces of breastplate armor\nSeveral unearthed artifacts (magatama, necklaces, ring-pommel sabers, etc)\n\n\n=== Others ===\nOrnate red \u014d-yoroi\nBlack lacquered kabuto, various helms\nKokitsunemaru, an \u014ddachi forged by Sanj\u014d Munechika\n\n\n== Annual celebrations ==\nJapanese New Year (January 1)\nGenji-sai (January 3)\nFurufudatakiage-sai (January 15)\nTama-no-o-sai (Night before Setsubun)\nSetsubun\nKinen-sai (February 19)\nKent\u014dk\u014dk\u014dsha-\u014dmatsuri (First Sunday of each month)\nShunki-\u014dmatsuri (April 15)\nCh\u014djuk\u014dsha-shunki-\u014dmatsuri (May 3)\nDenden Festival (June 30)\n\u014charae-shiki (June 30 and December 31)\nS\u016bkei-kai-\u014dmatsuri (First Sunday of each month)\nBoujisarae-shinji (October 1)\nFurumatsuri (October 15)\nCh\u014djuk\u014dsha-sh\u016bki-\u014dmatsuri (November 3)\nChinkon-sai (November 22)\nNiiname-no-matsuri (November 23)\nOhitaki-sai (December 8)\nThe Emperor's Birthday (December 23)\nHokura-matsuri (December 31)\nNew Year's Eve (December 31)\nTsukinami-no-matsuri (Every 1st and 15th day of the month)\n\n\n== See also ==\nSeven-Branched Sword\nKusanagi no tsurugi\nList of Jing\u016b\nList of Shinto shrines\nTwenty-Two Shrines\nList of National Treasures of Japan (temples)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)\nModern system of ranked Shinto Shrines\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBreen, John and Mark Teeuwen.

        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 359,666 and a population density of 1,300 persons per km2. There were 160,242 households residing in Nara. The highest concentration of both households and population, respectively about 46,000 and 125,000, is found along the newer bedtown districts, along the Kintetsu line connecting to Osaka.\nThere were about 3,000 registered foreigners in the city, of which Koreans and Chinese are the two largest groups with about 1,200 and 800 people respectively.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== Buddhist temples ===\nT\u014ddai-ji, including Nigatsu-d\u014d and Sh\u014ds\u014din\nSaidai-ji\nK\u014dfuku-ji\nGang\u014d-ji\nYakushi-ji\nT\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji\nShin-Yakushi-ji\nAkishino-dera\nByakug\u014d-ji\nDaian-ji\nEnj\u014d-ji\nEnsh\u014d-ji\nFutai-ji\nHannya-ji\nHokke-ji\nKik\u014d-ji\nRy\u014dsen-ji\nSh\u014dryaku-ji\n\n\n=== Shinto shrines ===\n\nHimuro Shrine\nKasuga Shrine\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine\n\n\n=== Former imperial palace ===\nHeij\u014d Palace\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNara National Museum\nNara Municipal Buried Cultural Properties Research Centre\nNara City Historical Materials Preservation House\nNara Prefectural Museum of Art\nIrie Taikichi Memorial Museum of Photography Nara City\nNakano Museum of Art\nNeiraku Museum\nSh\u014dhaku Art Museum\nYamato Bunkakan\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nFormer Daij\u014d-in Gardens (\u65e7\u5927\u4e57\u9662\u5ead\u5712)\nIsuien Garden\nKy\u016bseki Teien\nManyo Botanical Garden, Nara\nYoshiki-en\nYagy\u016b Iris Garden, Nara (\u67f3\u751f\u82b1\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3076\u5712)\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNaramachi\nNara Park\nNara Hotel\nNara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties\nYagy\u016b\nZut\u014d (\u982d\u5854)\nNara Dreamland\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nNara Marathon\nNara Centennial Hall\nNara Kasugano International Forum Iraka\nShuni-eGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Deer in Nara ==\nAccording to the legendary history of Kasuga Shrine, the god Takemikazuchi arrived in Nara on a white deer to guard the newly built capital of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d. Since then, the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.Tame sika deer (also known as spotted deer or Japanese deer) roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. In 2015, there were more than 1,200 sika deer in Nara. Snack vendors sell sika senbei (deer crackers) to visitors so they can feed the deer. Some deer have learned to bow in order to receive senbei from people.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\nAs of 2005, there are 16 high schools and 6 universities located in the city of Nara.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nNara Women's University is one of only two national women's universities in Japan.

        "wiki": "Nara (\u5948\u826f\u5e02, Nara-shi, Japanese: [na\ua71c\u027ea]) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. \nAs of 1 April 2019, Nara has an estimated population of 359,666, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. \nNara was the capital of Japan during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically T\u014ddai-ji, Saidai-ji, K\u014dfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gang\u014d-ji, Yakushi-ji, T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, and the Heij\u014d Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBy the Heian period, a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: \u4e43\u697d, \u4e43\u7f85, \u5e73, \u5e73\u57ce, \u540d\u826f, \u5948\u826f, \u5948\u7f85, \u5e38, \u90a3\u826f, \u90a3\u697d, \u90a3\u7f85, \u6962, \u8afe\u826f, \u8afe\u697d, \u5be7, \u5be7\u697d and \u513a\u7f85.\nA number of theories for the origin of the name \"Nara\" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962), is most widely accepted at present.\n\nThe Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that \"Nara\" was derived from narasu (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of Emperor Sujin, \"leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama.\" Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.\n\"Flat land\" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames, the author Kunio Yanagita states that \"the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called taira in eastern Japan and hae in the south of Kyushu, is called naru in the Ch\u016bgoku region and Shikoku (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb narasu, adverb narashi, and adjective narushi.\" This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary for nouns referring to flat areas: naru (found in Aida District, Okayama Prefecture and Ketaka District, Tottori Prefecture) and naro (found in K\u014dchi Prefecture); and also by an adjective narui which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of \"gentle\", \"gently sloping\", or \"easy\". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character \u5e73 (\"flat\"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, Inaba-shi (\u56e0\u5e61\u5fd7) from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern Tottori, as indicating the reading naruji for the word \u5e73\u5730 (standard reading heichi, meaning \"level/flat ground/land/country, a plain\"), Yanagita suggests that naruji would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically \"Nara\" was also written \u5e73 or \u5e73\u57ce as above is further support for this theory.\nThe idea that Nara is derived from \u6962 nara (Japanese for \"oak, deciduous Quercus spp.\") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo. This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (7-8th century) and Harima-no-kuni Fudoki (715). The latter book states the place name Narahara in Harima (around present-day Kasai)\u3000derives from this nara tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of Kashihara (literally \"live oak plain\") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese \u6a7f kashi \"live oak, evergreen Quercus spp.\").\nNara could be a loan word from Korean nara (\ub098\ub77c : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a linguist Matsuoka Shizuo. Not much about the Old Korean language is known today, and the first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga (1447),  Wolinseokbo (\u6708\u5370\u91cb\u8b5c. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (\u6cd5\u83ef\u7d93\u8afa\u89e3. 1463), and there is no evidence that proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (\ub098\ub797), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American  linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese \u58cc (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese na. (See also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are many places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.\nThere is the idea that Nara is akin to Tungusic na. In some Tungusic languages such as Orok (and likely Goguryeo language), na means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese nawi, an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases nawi furu and nawi yoru ('an earthquake occurs, to have an earthquake').The \"Flat land\" theory is adopted by Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names, history books on Nara and the like today, and it is regarded as the most likely.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Nara/Origins ===\nThere are a number of kofun in Nara, including Gosashi Kofun, Hishiage Kofun (\u30d2\u30b7\u30a2\u30b2\u53e4\u58b3), Horaisan Kofun (\u5b9d\u6765\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Konabe Kofun (\u30b3\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Ishizukayama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u77f3\u585a\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), Saki Misasagiyama Kofun (\u4f50\u7d00\u9675\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3), and Uwanabe Kofun (\u30a6\u30ef\u30ca\u30d9\u53e4\u58b3).\nBy decree of an edict on March 11, 708 AD, Empress Genmei ordered the court to relocate to the new capital, Nara. Once known as Heij\u014d or Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, the city was established as Japan's first permanent capital in 710 CE; it was the seat of government until 784 CE, albeit with five year interruption, lasting from 741-5 CE. Heij\u014d, as the \u2018penultimate court\u2019, however, was abandoned by the order of Emperor Kammu in 784 CE in favor of the temporary site of Nagaoka, and then Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) which retained the status of capital for 1,100 years, until the Meiji Emperor made the final move to Edo in 1869 CE. This first relocation was due to the court's transformation from an imperial nobility to a force of metropolitan elites and new technique of dynastic shedding which had refashioned the relationship between court, nobility, and country. Moreover, the ancient capital lent its name to Nara period.As a reactionary expression to the political centralization of China, the city of Nara (Heij\u014d) was modeled after the Tang capital at Chang\u2019an. Nara was laid out on a grid\u2014which was based upon the Handen system\u2014whereby the city was divided by four great roads. Likewise, according to Chinese cosmology, the ruler's place was fixed like the pole star. By dominating the capital, the ruler brought heaven to earth. Thus, the south facing palace centered at the north, bisected the ancient city, instituting \u2018Right Capital\u2019 and \u2018Left Capital\u2019 zones. As Nara came to be the epicenter of Buddhist church and drawing pilgrimage site, the city plan incorporated various pre-Heij\u014d and Heij\u014d period temples, of which the Yakushiji and the Todaiji still stand.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nA number of scholars have characterized the Nara period as a time of penal and administrative legal order. The Taih\u014d Code called for the establishment of administrative sects underneath the central government, and modeled many of the codes from the Chinese Tang dynasty. The code eventually disbanded, but its contents were largely preserved in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code of 718.Occupants of the throne during the period gradually shifted their focus from military preparation, to religious rites and institutions, in an attempt to strengthen their divine authority over the population.\n\n\n=== Religion and Temples ===\nNanto Rokush\u016bWith the establishment of the new capital, Asuka-dera, the temple of the Soga clan, was relocated within Nara. The Emperor Sh\u014dmu ordered the construction of T\u014ddai-ji Temple (largest wooden building in the world) and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. The temples of Nara, known collectively as the Nanto Shichi Daiji, remained spiritually significant even beyond the move of the political capital to Heian-ky\u014d in 794, thus giving Nara a synonym of Nanto (\u5357\u90fd \"The southern Capital\").\nOn December 2, 724 AD, in order to increase the visual \u201cmagnificence\u201d of the city, an edict was ordered by the government for the noblemen and the wealthy to renovate the roofs, pillars, and walls of their homes, although at that time this was unfeasible.Sightseeing in Nara city became popular in the Edo period, during which several visitor's maps of Nara were widely published. During the Meiji Period, the Kofukuji Temple lost some land and its monks were converted into Shinto priests, due to Buddhism being associated with the old shogunate.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Nara ===\nEven though Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February, 1898. Nara city has developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments. Nara was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in December 1998. The architecture of some shops, ryokans and art galleries has been adapted from traditional merchant houses.Nara holds traditional festivals every year, including the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki, a spring festival held in Todaiji temple for over 1,000 years; and the Kemari Festival, in which people wear costumes ranging across 700 years  and play traditional games).In 1909, Tatsuno Kingo designed the Nara Hotel, whose architecture combines  modern elements with traditional Japanese style.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Nara lies in the northern end of Nara Prefecture, directly bordering Kyoto Prefecture to its north.  The city is 22.22 kilometres (13.81 mi) from North to South, from East to West. As a result of the latest merger, effective April 1, 2005, that combined the villages of Tsuge and Tsukigase with the city of Nara, the city now borders Mie Prefecture directly to its east. The total area is 276.84 square kilometres (106.89 square miles).Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as Kashihara, Yamatok\u014driyama, Tenri, Yamatotakada, Sakurai and Goze), are located in the Nara Basin. This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient Heij\u014d Palace site, occupying the northern part of what was called the Geky\u014d (\u5916\u4eac), literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on Nij\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e8c\u6761\u5927\u8def), while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on Sanj\u014d-\u014dji (\u4e09\u6761\u5927\u8def), with both avenues running east\u2013west.\nThe highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of 822.0 m (2,696.85 ft) (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of 56.4 m (185.04 ft).\nNara Basin\nMur\u014d-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park\nYamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park\nKasugayama Primeval Forest\nSarusawa Pond (\u733f\u6ca2\u6c60)\nMount Wakakusa\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.\nThe basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F), and from 25 to 28 \u00b0C (77 to 82 \u00b0F) in the summer with highest readings reaching close to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.\nThe climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with  \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as 3,000 to 5,000 mm (118.11 to 196.85 in), which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.\nSpring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring.

        "wiki": "Ningen Isu (Japanese: \u4eba\u9593\u6905\u5b50, Hepburn: Ningen'isu, lit. \"The Human Chair\") is a Japanese heavy metal band from Hirosaki, formed in 1987 by Shinji Wajima (guitars and vocal) and Ken-ichi Suzuki (bass and vocal). They took their name from the 1924 short story of the same name by Edogawa Rampo.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 1980s ===\nBoth natives of Hirosaki, Wajima and Suzuki first became acquainted with one another while attending a concert in a local music salon. They eventually became close friends when in 1981, they both entered Hirosaki High School. Their friendship would further develop through frequent exchanges of music-records. It was around this time that Suzuki first exposed Wajima to the music of Kiss. Wajima himself was listening to the music of The Beatles, King Crimson, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin at the time, while Suzuki favored Kiss, Saxon and Judas Priest. Suzuki was impressed by Wajima's talent for songwriting and wrote a song called \"Demon\", while Wajima wrote a song called \"Tetsug\u014dshi Mokushi-roku\" (Apocalypse of Iron Grill), which was not received well by the music salon but which Suzuki liked nonetheless. Two years later, Wajima and Suzuki joined Shine Shine Dan ('dead dead group'), a band formed by members of the salon, with whom they played hard rock songs at music festivals.\nIn 1985, after entering different universities (Wajima would study Buddhism at Komazawa University while Suzuki studied Russian literature at Sophia University), they formed a hard rock band, whose name was changed to Ningen'isu in 1987, the year when drummer Noriyoshi Kamidate joined the band. They first gained public attention in 1989 through a performance of their song Inj\u016b (Beast In The Shadows) on the Japanese Television program \"Ikasu Band Tengoku\" (which roughly translates to \"cool band heaven\"), a newly enitiated TV-band-contest that first aired on TBS Television during the same year. Their uniquely heavy sound, technical skill, and lyrics full of literary references took the judges by surprise.\n\n\n=== 1990 \u2013 2004 ===\nIn 1990, they released their first album \"Ningen Isu\", followed two years later by \"\u014cgon no Yoake\", after which Kamidate left the band. They kept heavy sound and lyrics full of literature.\nDrummer Masuhiro Goto would support the recording of their fourth album \"Rash\u014dmon\" in 1993. In 1995 and 1996, Iwao Tsuchiya served as the band's drummer but was replaced by Goto as a permanent member until his leaving in 2003.\nIn 2004, the current drummer Nobu Nakajima joined. Wajima, Suzuki, and Nakajima once lived in a neighborhood in the district Koenji, Tokyo, which is famous for its subculture, music and free atmosphere.\n\n\n=== 2004 \u2013 2020 ===\nNingen Isu has seen a significant increase in popularity in recent years. They spent years being little known outside Japan; the sales of their CDs didn't go well, but they gradually gained popularity.\nThe band played at the Ozzfest 2013, hosted by Ozzy Osbourne, which they as Black Sabbath fans felt honored by. And after that, they have got more and more fans.\nIn 2019, their record \"Shin Seinen\" reached rank 14 in the Oricon music charts, their highest chart position of so far. \nPublished on May 14, 2019, their song \"Heartless Scat\" on YouTube reached 1.5 million views on July 3, 2019. \"Heartless Scat\" has since achieved 6.6 million views, as of August 31, 2020.\nThe band performed as their first world tour in Berlin, Bochum, and London in February 2020. \n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band often writes about Japanese classical literature, for example: Edogawa Rampo, Dazai Osamu, Akutagawa Ryunosuke, Tanizaki Jun-ichiro, Mishima Yukio and also Edgar Allan Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georges Bataille and so on. They often take up topics such as hell, Buddhism, the universe, samurai and gambling. Wajima and Suzuki have a local accent called the \"Tsugaru dialect\", which adds a unique and heavy atmosphere and rhythm to their songs. They, especially Wajima, often use difficult and old Japanese (words used in Edo period to Showa period, often hard to understand even for Japanese people). They often wear Kimono and traditional underwear Fundoshi on stage.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nNingen Isu was strongly influenced by Black Sabbath. Other influences include UFO, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Budgie, King Crimson, and similar artists. The play style of Wajima's guitar is influenced by guitarists such as Robert Fripp, Tony Iommi, Jimmy Page, Ace Frehley, Michael Schenker, and also the sound of Tsugaru-jamisen. Suzuki loves Kiss and paints his face white and moves like Gene Simmons. Suzuki has a high opinion of Nakajima's eight beat.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nShinji Wajima / Wazzy (\u548c\u5d8b\u614e\u6cbb; born 25 December 1965) \u2013 guitars, vocals, theremin, main lyrics, composer (1987\u2013present)His costume has motifs of literary master of Meiji era.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "T\u014ddai-ji (\u6771\u5927\u5bfa, Eastern Great Temple) is a Buddhist temple complex that was once one of the powerful Seven Great Temples, located in the city of Nara, Japan. Though it was originally founded in the year 738 CE, Todai-ji was not opened until the year 752 CE. Its Great Buddha Hall (\u5927\u4ecf\u6bbf Daibutsuden) houses the world's largest bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana, known in Japanese as Daibutsu (\u5927\u4ecf). The temple also serves as the Japanese headquarters of the Kegon school of Buddhism. The temple is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara\", together with seven other sites including temples, shrines and places in the city of Nara.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe beginning of building a temple where the Kinsh\u014dsen-ji complex sits today can be dated to 728 CE, when Emperor Sh\u014dmu established Kinsh\u014dsen-ji (\u91d1\u9418\u5c71\u5bfa) as an appeasement for Prince Motoi (ja:\u57fa\u738b), his first son with his Fujiwara clan consort K\u014dmy\u014dshi. Prince Motoi died a year after his birth.\nDuring the Tenpy\u014d era, Japan suffered from a series of disasters and epidemics. It was after experiencing these problems that Emperor Sh\u014dmu issued an edict in 741 to promote the construction of provincial temples throughout the nation. Later in 743 during the Tenpy\u014d era the Emperor commissioned the Daibutsu to be built in 743. T\u014ddai-ji (still Kinsh\u014dsen-ji at the time) was appointed as the provincial temple of Yamato Province and the head of all the provincial temples. With the alleged coup d'\u00e9tat by Nagaya in 729, a major outbreak of smallpox around 735\u2013737, worsened by several consecutive years of poor crops, followed by a rebellion led by Fujiwara no Hirotsugu in 740, the country was in a chaotic situation. Emperor Sh\u014dmu had been forced to move the capital four times, indicating a certain level of instability during this period.\n\n\n=== Role in early Japanese Buddhism ===\nAccording to legend, the monk Gy\u014dki went to Ise Grand Shrine to reconcile Shinto with Buddhism. He spent seven days and nights reciting sutras until the oracle declared Vairocana Buddha compatible with worship of the sun goddess Amaterasu.\nUnder the Ritsury\u014d system of government in the Nara period, Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the S\u014dg\u014d (\u50e7\u7db1, Office of Priestly Affairs). During this time, T\u014ddai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples and for the six Buddhist schools in Japan at the time: the Hoss\u014d, Kegon, J\u014djitsu, Sanron, Ritsu and Kusha. Letters dating from this time also show that all six Buddhist schools had offices at T\u014ddai-ji, complete with administrators, shrines and their own library.\n\nJapanese Buddhism during this time still maintained the lineage of the Vinaya and all officially licensed monks were required to take their ordination under the Vinaya at T\u014ddai-ji.  In 754 CE, ordination was given by Ganjin, who arrived in Japan after traveling over 12 years and six attempts of crossing the sea from China, to Empress K\u014dken, former Emperor Sh\u014dmu and others. Later Buddhist monks, including K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d received their ordination here as well. During K\u016bkai's administration of the S\u014dg\u014d, additional ordination ceremonies were added to T\u014ddai-ji, including the ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts from the Brahma Net Sutra and the esoteric Precepts, or Samaya, from Kukai's own newly established Shingon school of Buddhism. K\u016bkai added an Abhiseka Hall to use for initiating monks of the six Nara schools into the esoteric teachings. by 829 CE.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAs the center of power in Japanese Buddhism shifted away from Nara to Mount Hiei and the Tendai sect, and when the capital of Japan moved to Kamakura, T\u014ddai-ji's role in maintaining authority declined. In later generations, the Vinaya lineage also died out, despite repeated attempts to revive it; thus no more ordination ceremonies take place at T\u014ddai-ji.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Initial construction ===\n\nIn 743, Emperor Sh\u014dmu issued a law stating that the people should become directly involved with the establishment of new Buddhist temples throughout Japan. The Emperor believed that such piety would inspire Buddha to protect his country from further disaster. Gy\u014dki, with his pupils, traveled the provinces asking for donations. According to records kept by T\u014ddai-ji, more than 2,600,000 people in total helped construct the Great Buddha and its Hall; contributing rice, wood, metal, cloth, or labor; with 350,000 working directly on the statue's construction. The 16 m (52 ft) high statue was built through eight castings over three years, the head and neck being cast together as a separate element. The making of the statue was started first in Shigaraki. After enduring multiple fires and earthquakes, the construction was eventually resumed in Nara in 745, and the Buddha was finally completed in 751. A year later, in 752, the eye-opening ceremony was held with an attendance of 10,000 monks and 4,000 dancers to celebrate the completion of the Buddha. The Indian priest Bodhisena performed the eye-opening for Emperor Sh\u014dmu. The project cost Japan greatly, as the statue used much of Japan's bronze and relied entirely on imported gold.  48 lacquered cinnabar pillars, 1.5 m in diameter and 30 m long, support the blue tiled roof of the Daibutsu-den.Maps that include some of the original structures of Todai-ji are rare, though some still exist today. Some of these structures include, the two pagodas, the library, lecture hall, refectory, and the monk's quarters located behind the main hall. Todai-ji functioned not only as a place of worship and Buddhist practice, but as a place of higher learning and study. Much of what contemporaries now know about the original layout of the temple comes from the writings of monks who lived and studied there.\nThe original complex contained two 100 m pagodas, making them some of the tallest structures at the time. They were located on either side of the complex, one on the western (\u897f\u5854) and one on the eastern side (\u6771\u5854). The pagodas themselves were surrounded by a walled courtyard with four gates. These were destroyed by an earthquake. One of the s\u014drin finials survived and is standing at the spot where one of the pagodas used to stand.\nThe Sh\u014ds\u014din was its storehouse, and now contains many artifacts from the Tenpy\u014d period of Japanese history.\n\n\n=== Reconstructions post-Nara Period ===\n\n \nThe Great Buddha Hall (Daibutsuden) has been rebuilt twice after fire. The current building was finished in 1709, and although immense\u201457 metres (187 ft) long, 50 metres (160 ft) wide and 49 metres (161 ft) high\u2014it is actually 30% smaller than its predecessor, being reduced from 11 to 7 bays wide due to lack of funds. Until 1998, it was the world's largest wooden building. It has been surpassed by modern structures, such as the Japanese baseball stadium 'Odate Jukai Dome', amongst others. The Great Buddha statue has been recast several times for various reasons, including earthquake damage. The current hands of the statue were made in the Momoyama Period (1568\u20131615), and the head was made in the Edo period (1615\u20131867).\nThe existing Nandaimon (Great South Gate) was constructed at the end of the 12th century based on Daibutsuy\u014d style, after the original gate was destroyed by a typhoon during the Heian period. The dancing figures of the Nio, the two 8.5-metre-tall (28 ft) guardians at the Nandaimon, were built at around the same time by Unkei, Kaikei and their workshop members. The Nio are an A-un pair known as Ungyo, which by tradition has a facial expression with a closed mouth, and Agyo, which has an open mouthed expression. The two figures were closely evaluated and extensively restored by a team of art conservators between 1988 and 1993. Until then, these sculptures had never before been moved from the niches in which they were originally installed. This complex preservation project, costing $4.7 million, involved a restoration team of 15 experts from the National Treasure Repairing Institute in Kyoto.\n\n\n=== Dimensions of the Daibutsu ===\nThe temple gives the following dimensions for the statue:\nHeight: 14.98 m (49 ft 2 in)\nFace: 5.33 m (17 ft 6 in)\nEyes: 1.02 m (3 ft 4 in)\nNose: 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in)\nEars: 2.54 m (8 ft 4 in)The statue's shoulders are 28 meters across and there are 960 six curls atop its head.  The Birushana Buddha's golden halo is 27 m (87 ft) in diameter with 16 images each 2.4 m (8 ft) tall.Recently, using x-rays, a human tooth, along with pearls, mirrors, swords, and jewels were discovered inside of \nthe knee of the Great Buddha; these are believed to be the relics of Emperor Shomu.The statue weighs 500 tonnes (550 short tons).\n\n\n== Temple precincts and gardens ==\n \nVarious buildings of the T\u014ddai-ji have been incorporated within the overall aesthetic intention of the gardens' design.  Adjacent villas are today considered part of T\u014ddai-ji.  Some of these structures are now open to the public.\nOver the centuries, the buildings and gardens have evolved together as to become an integral part of an organic and living temple community.\nThe T\u014ddai-ji Culture Center opened on October 10, 2011, comprising a museum to exhibit the many sculptures and other treasures enshrined in the various temple halls, along with a library and research centre, storage facility, and auditorium.\n\n\n== Japanese national treasures at Todai-ji ==\n\nThe architectural master-works are classified as:\n\n\n== Major historical events ==\n\n728: Kinsh\u014dsen-ji, the forerunner of T\u014ddai-ji, is established as a gesture of appeasement for the troubled spirit of Prince Motoi.\n741: Emperor Sh\u014dmu calls for nationwide establishment of provincial temples, and Kinsh\u014dsen-ji appointed as the head provincial temple of Yamato.\n743: The Emperor commands that a very large Buddha image statue shall be built\u2014the Daibutsu or Great Buddha\u2014and initial work is begun at Shigaraki-no-miya.\n745: The capital returns to Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, construction of the Great Buddha resumes in Nara. Usage of the name T\u014ddai-ji appears on record.\n752: The Eye-opening Ceremony celebrating the completion of the Great Buddha held.\n855: The head of the great statue of the Buddha Vairocana suddenly fell to the ground; and gifts from the pious throughout the empire were collected to create another, more well-seated head for the restored Daibutsu.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nMatsuo Bash\u014d refers to the Great Buddha statue in a haiku (1689-1670):\n\u521d\u96ea\u3084 /  \u3044\u3064\u5927\u4ecf /  \u306e\u67f1\u7acb.\n\"First snow!/ When Buddha\u2019s great statue/ pillar-erection\"\nAnd,\n\"First snow and / there stands the great Buddha / a pillar of strength\"T\u014ddai-ji has been used as a location in several Japanese films and television dramas.

Performers included the Tokyo New Philharmonic Orchestra, X Japan, INXS, Jon Bon Jovi, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Tomoyasu Hotei, Roger Taylor, classic Japanese drummers, and a Buddhist monk choir. This event, organized by British producer Tony Hollingsworth, was simultaneously broadcast in 55 countries on May 22 and 23, 1994.\nThe 2007 animation series Mononoke (\u30e2\u30ce\u30ce\u602a), which is a spin-off of the 2006 horror anthology series Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, references the T\u014ddai-ji, particularly the treasure room Sh\u014ds\u014din, in Episodes 8 and 9.\n\n\n== International Outreach ==\nFollowing the April 2019 fire that damaged the spire of another UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, Japanese authorities declared plans to expand fire prevention measures at several historic locations including Todai-ji in Nara, partly by hiring new, younger employees in a context where temple and shrine staff are aging.  Custodians of Todaiji temple also installed a donation box, stating \u201cLet\u2019s Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral\u201d, in the hallway behind the Great Buddha statue.  In June 2019, a sign next to the box, in Japanese and English, explained why Todai-ji, as headquarters of the Kegon sect of Buddhism, was soliciting funds in this way. The English version declared, \u201cTodai-ji temple has been reconstructed every time it burned down by big fires thanks to the significant effort of many people.  We sincerely express our deepest sympathy for the tragedy that hit the Notre-Dame de Paris. Going beyond the creed, we would like to ask everyone for your support to reconstruct the cathedral.\u201d\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTamukeyama Hachiman Shrine, Shinto shrine near the temple precincts\nK\u014dtoku-in, location of the Kamakura Great Buddha\nSh\u014dh\u014d-ji, location of the Gifu Great Buddha\nKanjin#Kanjinshoku of Todai-ji\nNanto Shichi Daiji, Seven Great Temples of Nanto\nFor an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.\nList of National Treasures of Japan (ancient documents)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (temples)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (writings)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts-others)\nOld Government Buildings (Wellington), New Zealand \u2013 second-largest wooden building in the world\nOstankino Palace, third-largest wooden building in the world\nTourism in Japan\nSiege of Nara\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe official T\u014ddai-ji homepage (Japanese) (English)\nTodai-ji Guide GoJapanGo\nPhotos of T\u014ddai-ji Temple, its Lotus Hall and Ordination Hall\nPhotos of T\u014ddai-ji Temple and sika deer\nTodaiji Temple, from The Official Nara Travel Guide\n251381458  T\u014ddai-ji on OpenStreetMap",

          "Todaiji Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is favorite tourist attraction in Nara. The different with other Buddhist Temples, there is the largest Buddha statue in the world with a height of 14.98 m made of bronze .I looks like a dwarf in front of this giant Buddha",

          "Daibutsu or the giant buddha Don\u2019t miss if you visit Nara. The construction is so amazing! Audio guide is available. Admission fee for the buddha is 600 yen per person. Take kintetsu train from Osaka to Nara station and walk around 20 mins. Along the road you will meet many",
          "As others have mentioned, the original temple was constructed in 752 to house one of Japan's largest bronze statues of Buddha, and it is impressive. However, we were equally taken with the statue of Binzuru who is said to have occult powers. \"It is commonly believed in Japan",
          "Save your time for this temple and the surroundings, but don't waste your time and money for the deers, which are literally jumping on people who got the bad idea to buy the biscuits. The temple is huge an the buddha statue grandiose. There are also other beautiful temples to",

          "This is the largest Buddha statue that I have seen. It was so beautiful. Before you go in there are two large statues. These statues don't even compare to the massive Buddha statue that is inside the Temple. It was really beautiful. On the inside they had little booths where",
          "Nara is a great day out and distraction from hustle and bustle. Cooler in summer, lots of deer and temples. Todai-ji is the stunner though and worth the entrance fee or 600 Yen. Huge Buddha and statues.",
          "if you are in the area it is definitely worth it visit I would not necessary come all the way to Nara just for it but it was worth it as we were in Nara anyways",
          "This is the largest wooden temple in Japan (at time of me writing this anyway), and houses the big Buddha statue. It really is worth a visit as it is magnificent and different to many other temples you will see. The grounds around it are also beautiful so you don't need to come",
          "Visiting the Todai-ji for the third time, we found the Daibutsu and the Temple just as impressive as our first sighting! And the Sacred Deer continue to charm the continuous stream of arriving visitors, esp, the younger folks, A world-class attraction worthy of repeated",

          "I visited this site as part of a Limon Bus tour from Osaka. My visit was very rushed and I did not have time to spend with the deer or the Todai-ji Temple museum. I spent my time at the Todai-ji Temple site itself and I was very impressed. The gate leading to the temple is",
          "This was one of the highlights of the trip so far. An amazing building for its architecture but also pure brilliance of construction. It\u2019s huge. Set in lovely gardens and surroundings even at one of the busiest times of the year it still didn\u2019t feel too crowded.",
          "Combination of Todai-ji Temple and Museum entrance fee costs 1000YEN. My whole Nara experience was awesome! First time I laid eyes on Todai-ji Temple I said \"WOW, that's big!\" It's even bigger than the wooden Buddha in Fukuoka. The Octagonal Lantern is from around 752CE---it's",
          "There are seven great temples in Nara but unfortunately we didn't have time to visit them all. Todaiji Temple is said to be the most prestigious and we could see why. The enormous Nandaimon Gate is amazing, but the temple itself is even more impressive. The giant seated Buddha",

          "I visited as a part of a day trip to Nara. The Buddha is beautiful and impressive in size. The setting is lovely.",
          "My third time visiting and always a sight to behold. Deers roam freely nd are known to be messengers from Heaven. Do show your palms to the deers should they look to you for food. This signals that you do not have any to feed them. Feed deers only with the deer biscuits bought",

          "I got there at 7:45 , I missed the crowds and had a fabulous experience having the temple to myself I was first in the door - the deer are all around and in the morning lying together in a group. As you walk in there is a gong you can play which sounds fabulous . This temple",
          "One of the main reason people visiting Nara is this temple. The building himself is already something special, it\u2019s the biggest wooden only building. Inside you then can see a really big buddha with two guardians. Really impressive, a must visit!!",
          "Deservedly on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list this awe inspiring temple centred on the Great Buddha Statue has to be seen to be believed and is the highlight of any trip to Nara in my opinion. Its origins go back to the 8th century but it's been lost to fire and rebuilt a",

          "Todai-ji is the place to go if you finally want to see something big in Japan. Home of the biggest bronze Buddha in Japan, it's quite a sight. Not only does it have one, it is also home to many other buddha statues as well. I really enjoyed it, as it was my first time seeing",
          "It was crowded but that didn't take a way from the beauty of this temple and the serenity I felt there. It has a big buddha statue which was very impressive in my opinion. Also to get here you have to walk through the popular deer park, that by itself makes it an awesome",

          "While the walk from the parking to the temple is quite a bit, the Nara Park deers kept us busy. The temple is awesome! Serene, peaceful surroundings though when we went it was extra crowded, lots of school trips and tourists! However an amazing place! Buddha\u2019s statute is huge",
          "Roving bands of uniformed elementary and middle-school students ply the walk from bus stop to temple asking foreigners questions as a school English project. They're charming! Todai-ji has the huge wooden statues at each Torii, and its approach is well-attended by deer, begging",

          "This place is big. You get here by walking through the South Gate. There\u2019s a somewhat steep price for admittance, but it\u2019s well worth it. I\u2019ve never seen a wooden building so big before. This also has the giant Buddha inside that you can see up close if you pay.",
          "The enormity of this temple must be experienced. We happened upon a drumming performance that was so great. Truly a must on your travels in Japan.",
          "There are an unbelievable number of shrines and temples in Japan, but this is one of the can't-miss ones. The massive Buddha statute and the surrounding statutes are really extraordinary . The $5 USD admission charge is truly nominal for the sights inside. Try your hand at the",

          "We took a train from Kyoto and visited Nara for a day, Dodaiji temple was our main target destination. The main Buddha statue was enormous and there are few others in the same building. it's definitely worth taking a trip. We also walk around the Nara park and enjoy the",
          "This was a fun visit because there is a pole midway through the hall where there is a hole. Apparently if you crawl through the hole it\u2019s good luck. Only children and small people can fit through though. If you like religious places it\u2019s a popular spot. Either way, you can be in",
          "It is a very busy area around the temple but a worthwhile visit. The temple, it's entrance gates and square and the buddha are huge and their are smaller temples and things to view in the surrounds. Very interesting",
          "This is one of the must sees of the area. The whole area is huge and once you enter the building, you are amazed by the big statues. They sell some souvenirs inside, which are really good price compared to other places in Japan. Totally worth it!",
          "The Todai-ji temple was built in 741 by Emperor Shomu. It is the largest wooden structure in the world that houses the massive solid bronze Daibutsusan (Great Buddha). It\u2019s 72 feet high and weighs over 550 tons. The current Buddha only represents 2/3 of the original size as it",

          "We left Kyoto for Nara as soon as the rush hour was over, but the train was heaving. The same goes for Nara and the Todai-Ji temple. It was a week day as well. Bus loads of tourists. But it was worth it as the temple is impressive. We could see why it was so popular. Suggest one",

          "We visited on a weekday, while there were perhaps not as many tourists as I expected, this was more than made up for by school children of all ages on field trips. Todai-ji also pales in comparison to Kinkakuji and similar Kyoto attractions. If you've been to those then the main",
          "This is a must see if you\u2019re in Osaka, Kyoto or Nara. It is one of the most impressive temples in terms of its size. An imposing wooden structure housing the worlds largest bronze Buddha statue. Not to be missed!",
          "Easy access from the train station. Just get the bus day pass. 600 yen entrance and I recommend the audio talk which explains the statues and grounds etc. A very old monument rich in history, the biggest wooden structure in the world! Just a good visit really- not too big!",

          "I\u2019m not Buddhist hence probably unable to appreciate the magnificence of the statue. Though impressive in itself. The history is probably more impressive than the look of actual structure as there are many similar such monuments around the world. It\u2019s still a beautiful walk in",
          "Founded in the Eighth Century, this vast World Heritage temple is the world\u2019s largest wooden building, and is a living, vibrant place of contemplation and prayer. It houses a giant 50 feet tall bronze statue of Buddha, the entry to which is protected by huge wooden 20 feet tall",

          "In my short stint in Japan, I visited temples and shrines in Osaka, Kyoto and Nara. I found Nara to be the best of the three cities because it\u2019s not wrapped up by concrete all around. In addition, another peculiarities of the city which I really liked are the deers; there are",
          "Lovely temple, beautiful vibes, lots of tourists but you still can find a quiet corner and enjoy the visit. Buddha Vairocana is one of the largest statues of Buddha in the world, the weight is 380 tons.",
          "It was built by an emperor more than a thousand years ago. He used so much bronze, that all of Japan's bronze went into this Buddha statue. There is so much bronze, you can get from level 1 smithing to 100 in runescape just by making bronze swords. I got my 10th goshuin here.",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Nara Park. We enjoyed the Nara Park, and seeing the temple was just an additional bonus. I think it is the biggest wooden building, and I think the bronze Buddha statue is the biggest in the world. Very awesome",
          "It is a whole package tour. Great temple, with beautiful park, also with pond, deers, and also pigeons. Me and my family are very satisfied",
          "Felt so much as ease seeing this temple in Nara. The temple was of a wooden structure and was pretty well maintained. Can definitely see the Chinese influence and was awed by the Giant Buddha",

          "We visited this temple on April 9. You have the choice of two entrance fees. One only for the main hall with the Buddha and an other one for the main hall and the museum. We did not visit the museum. This place can be very crowded at times.",
          "I personally enjoyed visiting this temple and it's one of my favourite. There is desciption in english and mandarin for tourist to understand more about the place. Worth the price. The Buddha statue in the Great Hall is mesmerizing.",
          "You cannot miss this temple if you're visiting Nara. Impressive statues of Buddha (in fact is the biggest bronze statue of Buddha in the world) and his guardians are completing this beautiful construction. The deers walking free through the surroundings makes a great atmosphere.",
          "Definitely a world heritage site, the sheer size of the buddha and its accompanying solid-gold backdrop make for a neat thing to see in person. Walking about an entirely wooden structure of such magnitude built so long ago (far before any machine help) is also impressive. It's",
          "This great big Buddha statue is amazing to see -- one of the largest of its kind. There are very few signs in English but you are allowed to take photos inside the Temple.",
          "the budha statue is amazing and there are other nice statues, it's definitely wirth the train ride from Kyoto",
          "Very easy access from Nara Park and definitely worth a visit. It is one of the more expensive temples we had visited in Japan, at 1000 yen per person but still very reasonable for the experience! A really impressive wooden structure, housing impressive statues of Buddhist",
          "Visited here while in Nara for the day. Very impressive building - especially when you realize it was built 1300 years ago. Worth a visit and a walk around. Costs \u00a5600/pp to enter but worth it. Large buddha is also interesting.",
          "Something that should be on your to do list while in Nara. There are plenty of deers in the lead up to the temple as well as tourist shops. You can get a bus there from the train station that stops at different key sites. A very impressive structure to see while spending your",
          "The bronze Budda is impressive, if it's the biggest one or not doesn't really matter. Beautiful, made the trip to Nara worth it. Loved the other statues as well, but for me the most awesome part is the wooden structure of the temple.",
          "For those people that said previously this is the biggest buddah in the world, they've obviously never been to Thailand (Big Buddah Phuket). The one there atop a mountain is visible from space and makes this temples look insignificant. That said the buddah here is beautiful.",
          "This is a wonderful historical site where there are three giant Buddah statues. The staff do give audio guides for the temple for what I believe is 500\u00a5 (500 Yen), but if you don't want to have a boring audio guide there are free guides in English up until the temple and also",
          "It is one of those touristy places that one just have to see at least once. It has great cultural and historical importance. Dimensions of the main hall, which is also the biggest wooden building in the world, are breathtaking. It pays if you choose your timing for a visit",
          "The entrance gate to the temple is huge and ornate. Cherry blossom trees line the courtyard. On the 2 sides of the entrance are 2 huge statues which represent the beginning and the end of life. The Black Buddha statue is 15 meters high and flanked by 2 golden statues of the",
          "Really very beautiful. The cherry blossoms were falling while we were here as well. As at every shrine, there were charms to buy, but they were very specific to this shrine - a lot of deer souvenirs",
          "This place is really worth getting an admission ticket and going inside. There is a giant wooden statue of Buddha inside the main hall that is unlike anything else. Really worth a visit.",
          "We probably came on the wrong moment as there were many many people around (school buses, etc.). Faire enough, but difficult to get the feel of the place, even though of course, a Very Big Buddha is very impressive. Perhaps try to figure out when the Todai-Ji temple has less",
          "A massive timber temple a large sitting Buddha inside and guardians. There\u2019s also a pillar with a hole in the base - if you can pass through, it\u2019s the path to righteousness - something like that - it\u2019s meant for children and they will love it. Of course it also attracts some",
          "The temple is extremely impressive, as might be expected of the largest wooden building in the world. With the cherry blossoms and blue skies, it feels quintessentially Japanese. The Buddha inside is huge. The place is big enough not to be ruined by the crowds. A must see.",
          "Oh my gosh! This Buddha is so huge it's almost impossible to believe. The size and scale of the original temple is breath taking. We were there during sakurai season and the cherry trees all in bloom was absolutely gorgeous. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot",
          "This is the site of the world's biggest Buddha and it is well worth the time and effort to visit. Large crowds as you would imagine, flock to this attraction and I am sure no one walks away disappointed. Really worth a visit and one not to miss if in this part of Japan.",
          "It's hard to describe the scale of the temple and Buddha. It's truly something that should be seen in person as pictures don't do it justice. Gets very busy as there are several tour buses that stop here.",

          "It is a must see whether you do a day tour from Osaka or Kyoto. The area is busy but even with the large number of tourist there is plenty of space for everyone. Lots of school tours in April.",
          "Now this place is popular. If you would like to take a photo find your spot and wait a couple of minutes and your view will gradually clear and you will get that shot. The bronze statue of the Buddha is huge but you need some scale so a few people in the area will help you with",
          "This place is massive. The gate has two impressive wooden figures on each side. Then the main gallery is home of one of Japan\u2019s biggest Buddha statues. It gets really crowded but due to the size of everything is hard to miss any detail.",
          "Lovely temple, great as an addition to the Nara deer park visit. It wasn't too crowded so we were able to see everything and take some lovely pictures. Don't forget to try and go through the column on the right hand side of the temple!",
          "The outer gate to the temple complex is impressive with the two guardians at either side - Giants! After that you pay and enter the complex and the temple itself stands out. Once you get inside, you realize how large the bronze statues of Buddha is.",

          "A Must-have while in Nara. The building is huge - which makes the crowds not disappear but much less noticeable.",
          "Ok so the only way to get the full experience iMHO is to get out at 7am and walk the quiet streets through the park... see the surround temples and then at 7:30 or 8 go in the main gate to see the giant Buddha with hardly anyone there! The priests were chanting and it was an",
          "We reached this temple and there were already crowds lining up to purchase the entry ticket, which we saw cost 1000yen. We took a look from the outside, and rather headed to mount wakakusa, purchased the ticket for 150 yen and hiked and relaxed for about 3 hours. This temple",
          "No matter where you go, the numbers of crowds are unavoidable especially during this peak Sakura seasons. In order to get a good picture, made your trip as early as possible to avoid the Arrival of tour groups. One could made their prayers here or just as others like me to",
          "This was an interesting temple. It's very large, but there isn't a whole lot to see inside other than the large Budda. It was still worth the few $ we spent to visit however.",
          "We didn\u2019t get to visit the amazing buddha inside, the place was very crowded, but the outside is definitely worth visiting even more so during the cherry blossoms season.",
          "After being in Kyoto you kind of get over all the temples but this is quite spectacular. Very joyful",
          "If you want to see the biggest wooden Buddha in the world, I recommend that you stay in Nara overnight and go there in the morning, before 10am (even better - before 9am). After that, a huge amount of groups will arrive, and I mean, really really really HUGE. And visiting will",

          "Todaiji Temple is one of the most impressive and important temples in all Japan. It's a must when you come to my home town, Nara.",
          "I have see many Buddhist temples all over the world, but this is by far the most impressive, The structure of the huge wooden building alone is something one most see. Inside there is a huge bronze Buddha statue, with a golden next to it representing the time Buddha did not",
          "You won't miss this beautiful temple if you follow the walk path along the Nara Park. There is a gate surrounded the temple, so you won't see much from outside. It is a beautiful temple with big statues, all the statues are magnificent and well detailed. Just a gentle reminder",
          "...beside the deers of course. The giant Buddha\u2019s are big, of course too. The place closes at 5, if you stay until then you will get the chance to make photos without people, but you will need to be \u201cinside\u201d since they put curtains in the main door.",
          "The Buddha statue is huge and magnificent. However, not much is explained in english. Hence, it might make sense to rent audio guide.",
          "You will learn a lot about Japan getting in the temple. All rituals are unique. The history of the temple is amazing. It is a half day tour at least!",
          "The temple is the biggest wood construction and Buddha statue in bronze in the world. Combined with the visit of the deer park makes it worth the day trip to Nara which is 90 minutes away from Kyoto. Entry cost is minimal 600 for the temple and a 1,000 if you also want to visit",
          "It takes a lot to impress me but this place does. The grandeur of the building overwhelms while peaceful. You might think you've seen all of the temples you need to see but you're wrong. This is a must.",
          "If staying in Kyoto, the temptation is not to make the one hour trip to Nara to see yet another temple! We are so pleased that we did take a morning our of the schedule to visit this remarkable structure containing several huge statues, the largest being the bronze Buddha - it",
          "Well crowded places in impressive Buddhist Temple and of course the largest wooden structure in the world. The walkway leading up to the temple is highlighted by all the friendly deer plus many shops. The local bus available outside the train station makes it very easy to get",
          "Take your time to discover this place. It has many things to offer beyond being the largest wooden temple such as a chance to test your ability to reach nirvana, many wonderful buildings and small replicas of the temple as it changed over the years.",
          "We first visited this temple in 2010, and then came back with our two boys ages 5 and 7...9 years later. Its one of our favorites and so impressive, our boys even loved it and were amazed at the large Buddha, and crawled through the pillar!",
          "Largest wooden structure, housing largest bronze statue of Buddha. Over 1300 years old. Reasonably priced entry fee considering the significance of the site. Deer roaming freely in park near site is an added bonus.",
          "This is a large Buddhist temple in Nara, which houses the largest bronze Buddha statue in the world in its main hall. The admission fee is on the high side (\u00a5600 to access the temple grounds only, without museum admission), but you'll be greeted with an impressing Buddha statue",
          "We arrived here at the end of the day having walked around Nara Park and feeling rather tired. You can see the main temple from just inside the outer entrance but have to pay (600 Yen) to enter the main temple. We were in two minds whether or not to do so as we had seen two",
          "The temple architecture itself is stunning. The statues of Buddha and Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, sitting peacefully right at the hall facing main entrance, really caught attentions - enormous and holy. The beauty of craftsmanship as well as facial expression bring true peace",
          "It\u2019s really a massive place. We payed the 600 yen each to tour inside. Grab yourself an English speaking guide to understAnd what you\u2019re looking at.",
          "So this is just another temple. *yawn*. They all look pretty much the same but this one has a giant Budda inside it. $10 will get you in to see it. To be honest unless you absolutely must see the giant Budda for yourself I'd take the $10 and go buy lunch. Other than the",
          "We were on the fence whether the 1200 yen admission for two of us would be worth it, but it was. Pictures don't do the Great Buddha justice. It is dizzingly tall and just towers over you.",
          "This temple was built in 710 - 792 AD. It is Vairocana Budddha, meaning Buddha that shines throughout the world like the sun. It serves as both a place of worship/prayer for peace and affluence on earth.",
          "When i saw the picture on google it looks like a regular temple, but in reality its a huge complex. there are also wooden imitation of how the temple got bigger over years and how it looked in the past. the buddha statue is quite unique. Lovely place",
          "We visited on a mid week day (Tuesday) and when there was light rain.I think this was a bonus in keeping the crowds away. We had minimal people to contend with and found the Buddha and the temple interesting. As we stayed in Nara a number of days we passed by on a Saturday and",
          "Different from other Shrines and Temples in Japan, this place really felt like a special place. It's worth the time to walk from the Nara train station to the temple and do the entire round of the place.",
          "Todai-ji temple is one of the most amazing places in Nara! The wooden building is simply huge as well as the statues inside it. Also, it's a place full of peace! If you go to Nara, don't skip it.",
          "Near the Nara Park is the Todai-ji temple. The Great Buddha is extremely impressive as you enter the temple. There are also a number of other Buddha's there. The entire building doesn't take too long to go through, as you walk around the sites there is no opportunity to get",
          "Can be quite busy as it's one of the main attractions. Lovely approach through the park with all of the deer.",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. The huge Buddha was unique and beautiful. Its worth a visit to experience this place. Wasn't too busy the day we went.",
          "If you like huge Buddha statues, large crowds and aggressive deers, you have come to the right place. Take you time to go around the statue, there are good spots to take pictures, and not necessarily at the front where it can get really crowded. There is a hole in a major",
          "This is a very huge and historical temple. The exterior is very grand. You will huge statues of Buddha and other Gods inside the temple. Very impressive and breathtaking. It is about a 10 minute walk from the main road to the temple. While you are walking, you will run",
          "The great buddha is 15 meters and made of bronze. It costs 600 yen the ticket for the buddha. Nice temple. They have a lot of souvenirs there. Es de 15 metros y de bronce. La entrada sale 600 yenes, hay otra aue combina eso y la entrada al museo. Hay venta de souvenirs en el",
          "Fantastic temple experience. We received a free guided tour in English from a lovely volunteer. Probably my favourite temple visit in Japan.",
          "Must visit for all tourists. It costs 600 yen to visit the Buddha Hall and an extra 400 yen for the museum. Recommend coming around 4pm to view the sunset scene. Note that this place closes at 5pm though.",
          "Been there multiple times, everytime was a greater experience than the previous. An amazing temple, a bit too crowded at times, but if you can get past that and enjoy it, it's a must see spot.",
          "Todaiji temple could be reach by using a Bus or by walking from the Kintetsu Nara Station. We chose to walk towards the temple. As we walk, we already started encountering deer roaming around the area, and even on the roads! There are a lot of deer cookie vendor scattered in the",
          "If you're wondering which temple to see near Osaka since there are so many to choose from, I'd definitely choose Todai-ji. Why? Because the trip from Osaka is easy by train, and once you're there it's a casual walk to the temple via the Nara park. Most importantly, especially",
          "Very impressed with the building. Have to see it in you own eye. Not planned to enter initially, but was attracted by it when arrived by the entrance.",
          "No photo could ever do justice to how amazing Todai-ji Temple is in person. It has been the highlight of our entire Japan experience.",
          "Generally I make it a point to visit any temple/shrine in japan if I\u2019m nearby. So during my visit to Nara park I popped by. Personally, I felt a sense of awe when arrived at the temple. It\u2019s not the most majestic of buildings, but perhaps the surroundings blending in with the",
          "We arrived at Todai-ji at 8:15 and there were only a few people. At 9:00, most of the tour buses arrive and it gets very crowded. The temple is very large, but you will need 20 minutes in the temple at a maximum. There are paths leading to many minor sites to visit.",
          "We took a day off Ky\u014dto to go to Nara and we were not disappointed. Todai-ji Temple has amazing ancient buildings with massive Buddha inside. On top you get to walk around semi-wild dears. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "I will definitely be in the minority here, but the Giant Buddha of Todai-ji Temple did absolutely nothing for me. Perhaps it was the crowds, perhaps it was the exhausting summer heat, perhaps it was the darkness inside the temple itself - all I know is I wasn't impressed at all",
          "The Toda ji Zen temple is a wonder by itself. The statue is just wonderful. The temple is just jaw dropping Never seem something so large. .",
          "Biggest Buddha I've ever seen!! Unfortunately it's covered by a big wooden building so you can't really see it from the outside but I guess the want to preserve it or something \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14",
          "Nara is surprisingly full of attraction that were noted as World Heritage. This temple is no exception, it is the number one in the list, and we were there to also play with deer, which surprisingly a bit aggressive when fed. The temple ground is very scenic, it has maple trees",
          "This is not only the best temple to visit in Nara, it is also the busiest temple full of tour groups and school groups. However, just to experience the splendor of this temple is indeed wonderful. At the entrance to the main gate is a pond with a small shrine and some great",
          "Todaji Temple is, quite simply, spectacular. The temple building is HUGE and the statues it houses are incredible in both size and beauty. In my opinion, if you only see one thing in Nara, this has to be it.",
          "This is one of the must-see temples in Japan. A beautiful central Buddha, with a number of surrounding statues throughout the Temple.",
          "Need to walk some distant through Nara Park before arriving at Nandaimon Gate of T\u014ddaiji and Todaiji Temple. Some souvenir shops to get great souvenirs from Nara. See deers and more deers.",
          "Nara in general is just a charming town and the Todai-ji and its Giant Buddha are awe inspiring. Don't miss it! Extraordinary",
          "Impressive temple and statues especially as they are made of wood. Lots of Japanese history to pick up here.",
          "It takes you an auspicious time for Calm and Serene in mind to visit this holy place. You will enjoy the Deers that push their heads against you for crackers or pieces of bread. Be careful of them to take the paper tissues or plastic wrappers of sandwich from your holding",
          "The structure is massive and quite an architectural achievement during its time. The Buddha is monstrous in size. Nice walk through the Nara park with all the deer walking around looking for food from the visitors.",
          "was the visit to Nara, and in particular, Toda-ji Temple. Its beautiful. The Buddha Statue, the other statues in the hall, etc - amazing! it was also fun watching people wriggling their way through Buddha's Nostril!",
          "We visited during the off-season, but it was still very very crowded. Walking through the temple you are shoulder to shoulder and back to front with people. The building itself looked a little rundown, but maybe it's kept this way for a reason. Seeing the great Buddha was",
          "Todaiji Temple is a must for visitors to Nara. The structure is an architectural wonder of the Tang Dynasty building style that can scarcely be found in full integrity even in China, and in such excellent condition. One is easily awe struck by its dignity and grandeur. The",
          "Emperor Shomu wanted to build the biggest Buddha in the world and so 1/3 of the population at the time were \"employed\" to obey his wishes. It took 9 years in total. It has been destroyed by fire on several occasions and in the process of the various re-builds it is now 1/3",
          "Everything about this site is huge. The imposing Nandaimon as you approach is very imposing and is guarded by two Nio guardian kings, giant scary characters who themselves are designated \u2018national treasures\u2019 however this is just a warm up for the monumental Dalbutsuden",
          "Located in the north side of Nara park this temple is a must to see. When you follow a trail clockwise through the park it is one of the first big structures you will see. Inside there is a huge Buddha statue and the construction of the temple itself is also well worth observing.",
          "The temple buildings are set in a widespread park full of a peaceful mix of tourists and small deers. It's a pity the great wooden masterpieces inside the main tori had to be kept behind an iron web, in the dark, because they are as interesting as the great buddha. Well kept and",
          "Took the train from Kyoto to Nara and walked up to the temple. Big grounds and full of tourists and school groups when we were there We had a short 10 minute introduction to it by one of the volunteer guides at the entrance. Obviously the main attraction is the big Buddha but",
          "We went to the Todjai-ji Temple as part of a Celebrity Cruise tour. The main hall entrance houses what is claimed to be the biggest bronze buddha in the world. There is a tall black post in the far right corner and if you can fit through the hole in the bottom of the post you",
          "This is the temple to see - huge wooden structure with a massive Buddha inside. Spectacular. Look out for the wooden pillar which has a gap you can crawl through, the size of the Buddha\u2019s nostril. Goshuin are available, plus there are stamps near the Goshuin stand which you can",
          "It\u2019s amazing, doesn\u2019t even look real, it was an amazing sight. There\u2019s the whole history behind why it was made and why the hand was done like that etc. We went at an extremely busy time unfortunately so we followed the crowd and didn\u2019t have much time to take in the full view.",

          "Todai-ji Temple should be regarded as the landmark of Nara because the world's largest bronze buddha was placed inside the huge timber structure. The temple was easily accessible either by walking from the train station or take the local bus there. However the spot was normally",

          "My partner and I visited Todai-ji temple on the 15th of Oct- a Monday. Despite this it was incredibly busy, people were everywhere, we went fairly early in the morning. It was a nice, unique shrine, seeing the large bronze budda was amazing. I preferred other shrines in the are",

          "Our main goal for Nara was really just the deers. I just htough we could drop by the temple and take a look see. It was a really good experience since it was our first temple experience in Japan. There were stamps that you can collect at each temple you go to and this was out",
          "Must visit when you step in Nara. If you don\u2019t want to walk , you can take a bus from Nara Kintetsu station ( check with station master- direction ) and it will drop you in front of temple. Walking from station to temple should be around 15mins. Inside and Outside of temple",

          "This temple is one of the highlights of a visit to Nara and should be included in your itinerary. Although it gets quite busy, there's still enough space that it doesn't feel uncomfortably crowded. Worth paying the entrance fee to see the Buddhas inside.",
          "Very big and huge temple with a humongous campus and a very beautiful statue. Some deers are roaming around . And place was very crowded if you want to click some snaps with deers better to go to Nark park. This place you can reach by taking bus from station",
          "At this temple there is much more to see than in most temples in Japan. The temple is impressive and inside you can find more large statues. Access with a wheelchair is probably very hard.",
          "Basically this temple is the largest wooden temple in Japan sheltering the largest bronze Buddha. Its beautiful and you can't really appreciate the size until you see it in person. Very crowded with school parties when we visited and that did detract a bit.",
          "Beautiful and impressive. There's wheelchair/stroller access round the back as well (which also takes you away from the crowds as you enter, but you get into the main hall and the crowds are there again). Definitely worth a visit. Depending on which direction you come from,",

          "Amazing and beautiful temple. Deer heaven, thousands of them are moving around. Must bring camera. You can buy some food for deer, they are very friendly but once you show the food, they may be bit excited, better to be aware. The view of temple, the big Budha statue inside is",
          "We went to Todai-ji Temple 45 minutes before closing. There were not that many people there. The temple looks amazing from the outside. The big budah on the inside the temple is the most interesting part though. Seeing the statue and walking to it gave me that strange feeling",
          "An absolutely beautiful temple! The whole temple is huge compared to others we visited. The grounds are lovely to. We went part of a tour guide so heard about the history of the temple. There is a small shop inside the temple that sells cute little gifts.",

          "Glad that we made an effort to come to Nara since this is really a unique place, The temple has a huge Buddha statue with the Great Buddha Hall. There are a lot of deers wonder around the temple freely. If you are afraid of deers then avoid this place.",
          "The temple is amazing and the statues are the same but being an engineer I was impressed by the wooden structure. Entering the temple you can easily forget that it is made of wood, it's huge and well worth the visit and entrance fee.",
          "Worth a visit to see this massive wooden temple. We went at 8am before most of the crowds but would advise going at 7:30am when it opens to get ahead of the school tours too. Well worth a look.",
          "A must see when visiting Japan. Packed full of tourists and Japanese school kids. Be careful of the deers roaming the site as they do bite.",

          "Everything is kept to the highest standard. Our guide on the walking tour was very knowledgeable. The grounds are incredible and can't miss the deer. They are friendly, maybe too friendly sometimes. Do check out the surrounding gardens and other temples. All are worth it.",

          "The big bronze Buddah is breathtaking and you simply have to see and experience the magnitude. Really worth a trip from Osaka or Kyoto... but our recommendation is actually to stay in Nara for one night. Consider the guesthouse Naramachi!",

          "It was very crowded when we arrived at this temple, but it was a warm, inviting Friday afternoon. The Buddha statue was certainly worth a visit, despite the crowd. There were scale models of the temple complex on display as well. I suggest going earlier in the day if you want",
          "Todai-ji is one of several temples in Nara, but its sheer size is awe-inspiring making it the best (and the size of the golden Buddha inside it). It takes about 30 mins to an hour to have a good look around the site and it is important to visit the smaller temples in the area",

          "After walking through the Nara deer park, you'll find this temple. It was quite crowded mid day and we wasn't disappointed. The place was clean and well maintained. Very touristy but not to be missed!",
          "I\u2019ve been countless times and Todaiji is always the MUST SEE place anytime friends visit Japan. There are currently renovations to the north side of the main structure so that part of the building is covered.",
          "While Nara Deer park may be the most famus, I think this temple is the most important place in Nara that you must visit. The temple is big, beautiful and very clean inspite of the fact that there are thousands of tourists coming everyday. The highlight of this temple is the",
          "This was the best temple we visited in Japan, It is massive and the very large statue of Buddha is something to see. It is set within a park where deer roam free and are very tame. You can buy deer biscuits to feed them but beware they attack you before you can get the biscuits",
          "The temple and the Buddha are very impressive, huge monuments, highly recommend to visit. As everywhere, inside the temple is a large souvenir shop that doesn't quite add to the flair. Contrary to many reviews here saying the deer (of which there are 1,200 roaming around) are",
          "Full of history and wonderful pics to be taken. Very touristy but you cannot afford to miss it . Enjoy!",
          "In my recent visit to Japan I got an opprtunity to visit Todaiji Temple in Nara. To enter the temple you need to buy the ticket. Temple is the biggest wooden structure in the world and buddha's biggest bronze statue is placed in it. You feel at peace in the temple and",
          "It truly impressive. The biggest standing wood construction in the world, this temple is the most impressive thing I saw in Japan. There are a lot of tourists so you miss probably the feeling that it is a temple and not just a touristic attraction but it is good anyway. After",
          "I thought the Nandai-mon gate was impressive then I saw the Daibutsu-den Hall (which is supposed to be one of the biggest wooden buildings in the world). It was incredible, I thought it was even more amazing than the Great Buddha who lives inside. A must see.",
          "Have seen many large Buddha statues, so it wasn't the first time that I was seeing one, But the outside structure where the Buddha is housed and the entire experience is well worth the effort if you have a day (or even 5 hours to spare if you are in Kyoto).",
          "Well.. There is a huge statue of Buddah. And a temple. Thats it. Cool and all but do not expect more than that.",
          "The most impressive temple I've seen in Japan. The temple itself looks pretty, but it's what's inside that is awesome: three gigantic Buddha and two statues of two guardian deities.",
          "I have been here a couple of times over the last 30 years. Yes you can get a picture with the deer, after a while though they are more of a pest however the buildings, built without nails and the grounds are beautiful. A must see. Also in Nara park is the second largest Pagota",
          "When I was searching about Nara, I found this temple and go there was the best thing that I ever did in my live. It\u2019s very beautiful and very different of other temples that I went. Just a recommendation: take care with the deers in the way!! They are very cute but kinda",
          "Even if you only have a few hours to spare during you trip to Japan, go see this temple in Nara. The temple is the size of a cathedral, and made of wood. The Buddha is too large to describe - you need to see it. Pay attention to the replica lotus flower petals at ground level,",
          "Loved going in, so much respect shown to the buddhism religion. There is also a hole that kids crawl through and if you can fit through then you will receive good luck. I managed to fit through even though I'm was 19",
          "Impressive wooden Buddhist temple. It houses a 50 foot bronze statue of Buddha. It is from 750. Just after the entrance into the complex there is a manned table- and they offer a free 15 minute guided tour. We found out guide helpful in explaining the history of the complex.",
          "It's hard to describe in words the feeling and the emotion you'll encounter when you visit Daibutsu (Giant Buddha) at Toda-ji for the first time. I would recommend you NOT to search for too much information about or images of Daibutsu before your trip. Once arrived at Toda-ji,",
          "Amazingly beautiful temple in Nara. It is worth the walk among deers and the hundreds of tourists to see this temple.",
          "This place cost 600 Yen. The museum is under maintenance. The view is spectacular, never seen a temple so huge before!",

          "Traveling in July during the 2018 heat wave was challenging, but this temple was a must. Honestly did not think I could take another step, but seeing the temple from a distance clinched the deal. Absolutely gorgeous with a 49 foot Buddha.",
          "The temple's structural design was just amazing. It was even more amazing that the anicent japanese were able to build this temple without the current modern technology. Considering the size, it must have taken a huge amount of efforts by the ancient people to construct such a",
          "It's one of the most famous plapce to visit in Nara city. Usually you need to pay to get in, but I think it's free on August 15th.",
          "During my Kyoto stay made me so many experience to visit famous temples so far, but it was totally different scale. I can not believe the temple made without nails. Ancient Japanese people was super smart to build the kind of architecture. Gigantic Buddha is waiting for you",
          "located in the Nara park, where the entrance of the temple shows like a fantastic work of art by its size, and within the temple is located the great Buddha (magnificent) .....",
          "Visited this temple during the Osaka summer, and there were several school children on excursion as well. The view of the temple from the front gate is grand, and even more awesome when you realize the entire structure is made of wood. Do ask for a guide (free) for a brief",
          "The temple and of course the bowing deer are lovely but the site is very crowded. If you go here, make sure you go to a smaller temple, too, in order to appreciate the quiet spirituality of the place.",

          "Todai-Ji temple impressive on a huge scale the big Buddha is cool besides that there isn\u2019t much to see besides the deer all around the place. Sorry but on the down side we walked all around the park feeding the deer and saw the temple and was starving hungry \u201cnot a great deal to",
          "One of my favourite places during my visit to Japan. I would definitely recommend to have a day visit to Nara",
          "We ranked this as #1 destination during our vacation in June. The place and the Buddha are huge! The temple was, I believe, constructed in 752 and as you enter the gates, you will see the guardians that are as tall as a two story building. If you are traveling during summer",
          "Very impressive, the park is beautiful as well. We didn\u2019t buy any crackers for the deer and still have fun with them.",
          "Even without paying to go in you can admire the beauty and impressive scale of this building. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "We went to see the Great Buddha at Todaiji temple. There's a small fee to go in, but it's well worth it. The Buddha is massive and the grounds are kept beautifully. There are many deer outside the temple and you can buy a stack of crackers to feed them. They can get",
          "Great temple, can only be seen in person to appreciate it. You probably won't when you are there but you will 2 months from visiting and be like 'that was pretty special.'",
          "The Great Buddha (Daibutsu) of Nara is definitely something worth visiting when in the area. It\u2019s size is remarkable as is the structure around it. Also, the park with its deer makes for a pleasant stroll. It is quite crowded, though.",
          "The sheer scale of this wooden building is jaw dropping. Giant tree trunks form the uprights and the craftsmanship and skill required to cast a bronze Buddha of that size is extraordinary. Todai - ji is on all the tour bus hit lists so get there early to avoid the masses . The",
          "The sheer size of the main temple is staggering, but equally impressive is the age of some of the artifacts. The main structure dates to 1709, parts of the Buddha statue date to the 1500s, but you'll see some pieces that actually date back more than 1,300 years!!! We're talking",
          "So much to see and so very dear.... I mean deer! Be sure and buy some treats to feed them and notice how they will bow to you. Walk through and around the Buddha. On the backside and to the right, there is a small hole that will bring you good luck assuming you are dainty",
          "Still can't believe that the whole thing is made mainly of wood, and the supports are just sitting on rocks.",
          "The sheer scale of Todai-ji is perhaps its greatest attraction - seeing the crowds reduced to ant size as they approach such a massive ancient wooden building. Once inside, the scale can got lost among the crowds and stalls selling postcards, souvenirs and blessings. An",
          "I loved the Toda-ji Temple, Giant Buddha and feeding the deer here. It is crowded, but it is an enjoyable day out. Get prepared to be overwhelmed with deer if you have deer cookies. They will give you little nips on the bottom etc to get your attention. Very funny. Be",
          "Shame on you if you come to Nara just to pet/feed the deer. Nara is for Todai-Ji temple! Magnificent architecture and the Great Buddha statue blew my heart away!",

          "To make it in the top five with over 77,000 temples throughout Japan is quite a feat. A landmark of Nara, this is one of Japan's most famous temples. Originally constructed in 752, it is historically significant as it was the head Temple of all Buddhist temples. Even though the",

          "One piece of advice: go early. It is a completely different experience to go without throngs of tourists about. If you do go early, do NOT get deer food. Deer will surround, harass and BITE you until you drop all of it. They have somehow learned that this is the most efficient",

        "wiki": "The Ikoma Cable Line (\u751f\u99d2\u92fc\u7d22\u7dda, Ikoma k\u014dsaku sen), referred to as Ikoma Cable (\u751f\u99d2\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb, Ikoma k\u0113buru), is a cable railway line owned and operated by the Kintetsu Railway, a Japanese major private railway. The line connects Toriimae to Ikomasanjo, all of which are within Ikoma, Nara, Japan.\n\n\n== Basic data ==\nLines and distances:\nH\u014dzanji Line: Toriimae - H\u014dzanji, 0.9 km (0.6 mi)\nSanj\u014d Line: H\u014dzanji - Ikoma-Sanj\u014d, 1.1 km (0.7 mi)\nGauge: 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in)\nStations: 5\nDouble track line: Toriimae \u2014 H\u014dzanji\nQuadruple at the passing loop\nVertical interval:\nH\u014dzanji Line: 146 m (479 ft)\nSanj\u014d Line: 322 m (1,056 ft)\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Ikoma Cable Line is actually made up of two different lines; H\u014dzanji Line (\u5b9d\u5c71\u5bfa\u7dda, H\u014dzanji-sen) between Toriimae and H\u014dzanji, Sanj\u014d Line (\u5c71\u4e0a\u7dda, Sanj\u014d-sen) between H\u014dzanji and Ikoma-Sanj\u014d. The H\u014dzanji Line is the oldest commercially operated funicular in Japan, opened in 1918. It runs to H\u014dzan-ji, a Shingon Buddhist temple. Sanj\u014d Line climbs up Mount Ikoma, reaching Ikoma Sanjo Amusement Park.\nThe H\u014dzanji Line is the only double-track funicular in the country. However, the two tracks are treated as different lines, called H\u014dzanji Line 1 (\u5b9d\u5c71\u5bfa1\u53f7\u7dda, H\u014dzanji Ichi-g\u014d-sen) and H\u014dzanji Line 2 (\u5b9d\u5c71\u5bfa2\u53f7\u7dda, H\u014dzanji Ni-g\u014d-sen). Normally, only H\u014dzanji Line 1 and Sanj\u014d Line are used. H\u014dzanji Line 2 is operated in holiday seasons, and for safety inspections of the Line 1. Since the H\u014dzanji Line runs along a fairly urbanized area, it also functions as a commuter line. However, the line does not accept PiTaPa, a smart card ticketing system, nor Surutto Kansai, a prepaid magnetic card ticketing system.\n\n\n== Rolling stocks ==\nH\u014dzanji Line 1 used classical 1928 cars until 2000, when they were replaced by the current fancy-decorated cars. Since then, bulldog-faced \"Bull\" and calico cat-faced \"Mike\" serve the line, both officially being Type Ko 11. Sanj\u014d Line uses organ-like \"Do-Re-Mi\", cake-decorated \"Sweet\", both officially Type Ko 15. H\u014dzanji Line 2 uses ordinary-shaped Type Ko 3 cars, nicknamed \"Yume-Ikoma\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Stations ==\nAll stations are in Ikoma, Nara Prefecture. For distances and connections, see the route diagram.\n\nH\u014dzanji Line 1 and 2\nToriimae (\u9ce5\u5c45\u524d)\nH\u014dzanji (\u5b9d\u5c71\u5bfa)\nSanj\u014d Line (D: Direct trains stop, operated seasonally)\nH\u014dzanji D\nUmeyashiki (\u6885\u5c4b\u6577)\nKasumigaoka (\u971e\u30f6\u4e18)\nIkoma-Sanj\u014d D (\u751f\u99d2\u5c71\u4e0a)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCable car\nFunicular railway\nList of funicular railways\nList of railway lines in Japan\nMt.

        "wiki": "Osaka (Japanese: \u5927\u962a\u5e02, Hepburn: \u014csaka-shi, pronounced [o\u02d0saka\u0255i]; commonly just \u5927\u962a, \u014csaka [o\u02d0saka] (listen)) is a designated city in the Kansai region of Honshu in Japan. It is the capital city of Osaka Prefecture and the largest component of the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area, the second largest metropolitan area in Japan and among the largest in the world with more than 20 million inhabitants.\nOsaka was traditionally considered Japan's economic hub. By the Kofun period (300\u2013538) it had developed into an important regional port, and in the 7th and 8th centuries, it served briefly as the imperial capital. Osaka continued to flourish during the Edo period (1603\u20131867) and became known as a center of Japanese culture. Following the Meiji Restoration, Osaka greatly expanded in size and underwent rapid industrialization. In 1889, Osaka was officially established as a municipality.\nToday, Osaka is a major financial center of Japan. It is home to the Osaka Securities Exchange as well as the multinational electronics corporations Panasonic and Sharp. Famous landmarks in Osaka include Osaka Castle - which played a pivotal role in the Siege of Osaka - and Shitenn\u014d-ji - the oldest Buddhist temple in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\u014csaka means \"large hill\" or \"large slope\". It is unclear when this name gained prominence over Naniwa, but the oldest written evidence for the name dates back to 1496.The name is written \u5927\u962a in kanji, but it was written \u5927\u5742 until 1870, when the partisans for the Meiji Restoration changed it, apparently to avoid the second kanji being misinterpreted as \u58eb\u53cd, meaning \"samurai rebellion\". The older kanji is still in very limited use, usually in historical contexts, but in Japanese the kanji \u962a\u2014pronounced han when standing alone\u2014refers to Osaka City or Osaka Prefecture.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory to the Kofun period ===\nSome of the earliest signs of human habitation in the Osaka area at the Morinomiya ruins (\u68ee\u30ce\u5bae\u907a\u8de1, Morinomiya iseki) comprise shell mounds, sea oysters and buried human skeletons from the 6th\u20135th centuries BC. It is believed that what is today the Uehonmachi area consisted of a peninsula with an inland sea in the east. During the Yayoi period, permanent habitation on the plains grew as rice farming became popular.By the Kofun period, Osaka developed into a hub port connecting the region to the western part of Japan. The large numbers of increasingly larger tomb mounds found in the plains of Osaka are seen as evidence of political-power concentration, leading to the formation of a state.\n\n\n=== Asuka and Nara period ===\nThe Kojiki records that during 390\u2013430 AD, there was an imperial palace located at Osumi, in what is present day Higashiyodogawa ward, but it may have been a secondary imperial residence rather than a capital.In 645, Emperor K\u014dtoku built his Naniwa Nagara-Toyosaki Palace in what is now Osaka, making it the capital of Japan. The city now known as Osaka was at this time referred to as Naniwa, and this name and derivations of it are still in use for districts in central Osaka such as Naniwa (\u6d6a\u901f) and Namba (\u96e3\u6ce2). Although the capital was moved to Asuka (in Nara Prefecture today) in 655, Naniwa remained a vital connection, by land and sea, between Yamato (modern day Nara Prefecture), Korea, and China.Naniwa was declared the capital again in 744 by order of Emperor Sh\u014dmu, and remained so until 745, when the Imperial Court moved back to Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (now Nara). By the end of the Nara period, Naniwa's seaport roles had been gradually taken over by neighboring areas, but it remained a lively center of river, channel, and land transportation between Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto today) and other destinations.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Heian to Edo period ===\nIn 1496, J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b Buddhists established their headquarters in the heavily fortified Ishiyama Hongan-ji, located directly on the site of the old Naniwa Imperial Palace. Oda Nobunaga began a decade-long siege campaign on the temple in 1570 which ultimately resulted in the surrender of the monks and subsequent razing of the temple. Toyotomi Hideyoshi constructed Osaka Castle in its place in 1583.Osaka was long considered Japan's primary economic center, with a large percentage of the population belonging to the merchant class (see Four divisions of society). Over the course of the Edo period (1603\u20131867), Osaka grew into one of Japan's major cities and returned to its ancient role as a lively and important port. Its popular culture was closely related to ukiyo-e depictions of life in Edo. By 1780, Osaka had cultivated a vibrant arts culture, as typified by its famous Kabuki and Bunraku theaters. In 1837, \u014cshio Heihachir\u014d, a low-ranking samurai, led a peasant insurrection in response to the city's unwillingness to support the many poor and suffering families in the area. Approximately one-quarter of the city was razed before shogunal officials put down the rebellion, after which \u014cshio killed himself. Osaka was opened to foreign trade by the government of the Bakufu at the same time as Hy\u014dgo (modern Kobe) on 1 January 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration.Osaka residents were stereotyped in Edo literature from at least the 18th century. Jippensha Ikku in 1802 depicted Osakans as stingy almost beyond belief. In 1809, the derogatory term \"Kamigata zeeroku\" was used by Edo residents to characterize inhabitants of the Osaka region in terms of calculation, shrewdness, lack of civic spirit, and the vulgarity of Osaka dialect. Edo writers aspired to samurai culture, and saw themselves as poor but generous, chaste, and public spirited. Edo writers by contrast saw \"zeeroku\" as obsequious apprentices, stingy, greedy, gluttonous, and lewd. To some degree, Osaka residents are still stigmatized by Tokyo observers in the same way today, especially in terms of gluttony, evidenced in the phrase, \"Residents of Osaka devour their food until they collapse\" (\u5927\u962a\u306f\u98df\u5012\u308c, \"\u014csaka wa kuidaore\").\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 19th century to present ===\nThe modern municipality was established in 1889 by government ordinance, with an initial area of 15 square kilometres (6 sq mi), overlapping today's Ch\u016b\u014d and Nishi wards. Later, the city went through three major expansions to reach its current size of 223 square kilometres (86 sq mi).  Osaka was the industrial center most clearly defined in the development of capitalism in Japan.  It became known as the \"Manchester of the Orient\". The rapid industrialization attracted many Korean immigrants, who set up a life apart for themselves. The political system was  pluralistic, with a strong emphasis on promoting industrialization and modernization. Literacy was high and the educational system expanded rapidly, producing a middle class with a taste for literature and a willingness to support the arts. In 1927, General Motors operated a factory called Osaka Assembly until 1941, manufacturing Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick vehicles, operated and staffed by Japanese workers and managers. In the nearby city of Ikeda in Osaka Prefecture is the headquarters office of Daihatsu, one of Japan's oldest automobile manufacturers.\nLike its European and American counterparts, Osaka displayed slums, unemployment, and poverty. In Japan it was here that municipal government first introduced a comprehensive system of poverty relief, copied in part from British models. Osaka policymakers stressed the importance of family formation and mutual assistance as the best way to combat poverty. This minimized the cost of welfare programs.During World War II, Osaka came under air attacks in 1945 by the United States Army Air Forces as part of the air raids on Japan. On March 13, 1945, a total of 329 Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers took part in the raid against Osaka. According to an American prisoner of war who was held in the city, the air raid took almost the entire night and destroyed 25 square miles (65 km2) of the city. The U.S. bombed the city again twice in June 1945 and again on August 14, a day before Japan's surrender.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nThe city's west side is open to Osaka Bay, and is otherwise completely surrounded by more than ten satellite cities, all of them in Osaka Prefecture, with one exception: the city of Amagasaki, belonging to Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, in the northwest. The city occupies a larger area (about 13%) than any other city or village within Osaka Prefecture. When the city was established in 1889, it occupied roughly the area known today as the Chuo and Nishi wards, only 15.27 square kilometres (3,773 acres) that would eventually grow into today's 222.30 square kilometres (54,932 acres) via incremental expansions, the largest of which being a single 126.01 square kilometres (31,138 acres) expansion in 1925. Osaka's highest point is 37.5 metres (123.0 ft) Tokyo Peil in Tsurumi-ku, and the lowest point is in Nishiyodogawa-ku at \u22122.2 metres (\u22127.2 ft) Tokyo Peil.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nOsaka is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), with four distinct seasons. Its winters are generally mild, with January being the coldest month having an average high of 9.3 \u00b0C (49 \u00b0F). The city rarely sees snowfall during the winter. Spring in Osaka starts off mild, but ends up being hot and humid. It also tends to be Osaka's wettest season, with the tsuyu (\u6885\u96e8, tsuyu, \"plum rain\") \u2014 the rainy season \u2014 occurring between early June and late July. The average starting and ending dates of the rainy season are June 7 and July 21 respectively. Summers are very hot and humid. In August, the hottest month, the average daily high temperature reaches 33.5 \u00b0C (92 \u00b0F), while average nighttime low temperatures typically hover around 25.5 \u00b0C (78 \u00b0F). Fall in Osaka sees a cooling trend, with the early part of the season resembling summer while the latter part of fall resembles winter. Precipitation is abundant, with winter being the driest season, while monthly rainfall peaks in June with the \"tsuyu\" rainy season, which typically ends in mid to late July. From late July through the end of August, summer's heat and humidity peaks, and rainfall decreases somewhat. Osaka experiences a second rainy period in September and early October, when tropical weather systems, including typhoons, coming from the south or southwest are possible.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nOsaka's sprawling cityscape has been described as \"only surpassed by Tokyo as a showcase of the Japanese urban phenomenon\".\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nCentral Osaka is roughly divided into downtown and uptown areas known as Kita (\u5317, \"north\") and Minami (\u5357, \"south\").Kita is home to the Umeda district and its immediate surrounding neighborhoods, a major business and retail hub that plays host to Osaka Station City and a large subterranean network of shopping arcades. Kita and nearby Nakanoshima contain a prominent portion of the city's skyscrapers and are often featured in photographs of Osaka's skyline.\nMinami, though meaning \"south\", is essentially in Ch\u016b\u014d Ward (\u4e2d\u592e\u533a, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku) and geographically central within the city. Well known districts here include Namba and Shinsaibashi shopping areas, the D\u014dtonbori canal entertainment area, Nipponbashi Den Den Town, as well as arts and fashion culture-oriented areas such as Amerikamura and Horie.\nThe business districts between Kita and Minami such as Honmachi and Yodoyabashi, called Semba (\u8239\u5834), house the regional headquarters of many large-scale banks and corporations. The Mid\u014dsuji boulevard runs through Semba and connects Kita and Minami.\nFurther south of Minami are neighborhoods such as Shinsekai (with its Ts\u016btenkaku tower), Tennoji and Abeno (with Tennoji Zoo, Shitenn\u014d-ji and Abeno Harukas), and the Kamagasaki slum, the largest slum in Japan.The city's west side is a prominent bay area which serves as its main port as well as a tourist destination with attractions such as Kyocera Dome, Universal Studios Japan and the Tempozan Harbour Village. East Osaka is zoned as a separate city, although the east side of Osaka city proper contains numerous residential neighborhoods including Tsuruhashi Korea Town, as well as the Osaka Castle Park, Osaka Business Park and the hub Ky\u014dbashi Station.\nOsaka contains numerous urban canals and bridges, many of which serve as the namesake for their surrounding neighbourhoods. The phrase \"808 bridges of Naniwa\" was an expression in old Japan used to indicate impressiveness and the \"uncountable\". Osaka numbered roughly 200 bridges by the Edo period  and 1629 bridges by 1925.  As many of the city's canals were gradually filled in, the number dropped to 872, of which 760 are currently managed by Osaka City.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== List of special wards ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the census in 2005, there were 2,628,811 residents in Osaka, an increase of 30,037 or 1.2% from 2000. There were 1,280,325 households with approximately 2.1 persons per household. The population density was 11,836 persons per km2. The Great Kant\u014d earthquake caused a mass migration to Osaka between 1920 and 1930, and the city became Japan's largest city in 1930 with 2,453,573 people, outnumbering even Tokyo, which had a population of 2,070,913. The population peaked at 3,252,340 in 1940, and had a post-war peak of 3,156,222 in 1965, but continued to decrease since, as the residents moved out to the suburbs.There were 99,775.5 registered foreigners, the two largest groups being Korean (71,015) and Chinese (11,848). Ikuno, with its Tsuruhashi district, is the home to one of the largest population of Korean residents in Japan, with 27,466 registered Zainichi Koreans.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\n\nThe commonly spoken dialect of this area is Osaka-ben, a typical sub-dialect of Kansai-ben. Of the many other particularities that characterize Osaka-ben, examples include using the copula ya instead of da, and the suffix -hen instead of -nai in the negative of verbs.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe Osaka City Council is the city's local government formed under the Local Autonomy Law. The council has eighty-nine seats, allocated to the twenty-four wards proportional to their population and re-elected by the citizens every four years. The council elects its president and Vice President. Toshifumi Tagaya (LDP) is the current and 104th president since May 2008. The mayor of the city is directly elected by the citizens every four years as well, in accordance with the Local Autonomy Law. T\u014dru Hashimoto, former governor of Osaka Prefecture is the 19th mayor of Osaka since 2011. The mayor is supported by two vice mayors, currently Akira Morishita and Takashi Kashiwagi, who are appointed by him in accordance with the city bylaw.Osaka also houses several agencies of the Japanese government. Below is a list of governmental offices housed in Osaka.\n\nIn July 2012, a joint multi-party bill was submitted to the Diet that would allow for implementation of the Osaka Metropolis plan as pursued by the mayor of Osaka city, the governor of Osaka and their party. If implemented, Osaka City, neighbouring Sakai City and possibly other surrounding municipalities would dissolve and be reorganized as four special wards of Osaka prefecture \u2013 similar to former Tokyo City's successor wards within Tokyo prefecture. Special wards are municipal-level administrative units that leave some otherwise municipal administrative responsibilities and revenues to the prefectural administration. In December 2018 the mayor and governor of Osaka may resign to force a referendum on the Metropolis plan to coincide with the election for those positions in the spring of 2019.In October 2018, the city of Osaka officially ended its sister city relationship with San Francisco in the United States after the latter permitted a monument memorializing \"comfort women\" to remain on a city-owned property, circulating in the process a 10-page, 3,800-word letter in English addressed to San Francisco mayor London Breed.\n\n\n== Politics regarding the use of nuclear energy ==\nOn February 27, 2012, three Kansai cities, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, jointly asked Kansai Electric Power Company to break its dependence on nuclear power. In a letter to KEPCO they also requested to disclose information on the demand and supply of electricity, and for lower and stable prices. The three cities were stockholders of the plant: Osaka owned 9% of the shares, while Kobe had 3% and Kyoto 0.45%. Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, announced a proposal to minimize the dependence on nuclear power for the shareholders meeting in June 2012.On March 18, 2012, the city of Osaka decided as largest shareholder of Kansai Electric Power Co, that at the next shareholders-meeting in June 2012 it would demand a series of changes:\n\nthat Kansai Electric would be split into two companies, separating power generation from power transmission.\na reduction of the number of the utility's executives and employees.\nthe implementation of absolutely secure measurements to ensuring the safety of the nuclear facilities.\nthe disposing of spent fuel.\nthe installation of new kind of thermal power generation to secure non-nuclear supply of energy.\nselling all unnecessary assets including the stock holdings of KEPCO.In this action, Osaka had secured the support of two other cities and shareholders: Kyoto and Kobe, but with their combined voting-rights of 12.5 percent they were not certain of the ultimate outcome, because for this two-thirds of the shareholders would be needed to agree to revise the corporate charter.At a meeting held on April 10, 2012 by the \"energy strategy council\", formed by the city of Osaka and the governments of the prefectures, it became clear that at the end of the fiscal year 2011 some 69 employees of Kansai Electric Power Company were former public servants. \"Amakudari\" was the Japanese name for this practice of rewarding by hiring officials that formerly controlled and supervised the firm. Such people included the following:\n\n13 ex-officials of the: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism\n3 ex-officials of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,\n2 ex-officials of the Ministry of the Environment,\n16 former policemen,\n10 former fire-fighters,\n13 former civil engineers.Besides this, it became known that Kansai Electric had done about 600 external financial donations, to a total sum of about 1.695 billion yen:\n\n70 donations were paid to local governments: to a total of 699 million yen\n100 donations to public-service organizations: 443 million yen,\n430 donations to various organizations and foundations: a total of 553 million yenDuring this meeting some 8 conditions were compiled, that needed to be fulfilled before a restart of the No.3 and No.4 reactors Oi Nuclear Power Plant:\n\nthe consent of the local people and government within 100 kilometer from the plant\nthe installation of a new independent regulatory agency\na nuclear safety agreement\nthe establishment of new nuclear safety standards\nstress tests and evaluations based on these new safety rules \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe gross city product of Osaka in fiscal year 2004 was \u00a521.3 trillion, an increase of 1.2% over the previous year. The figure accounts for about 55% of the total output in the Osaka Prefecture and 26.5% in the Kinki region. In 2004, commerce, services, and manufacturing have been the three major industries, accounting for 30%, 26%, and 11% of the total, respectively. The per capita income in the city was about \u00a53.3 million, 10% higher than that of the Osaka Prefecture. MasterCard Worldwide reported that Osaka ranks 19th among the world's leading cities and plays an important role in the global economy.\n\nThe GDP in the greater Osaka area (Osaka and Kobe) is $341 billion. Osaka, along with Paris and London, has one of the most productive hinterlands in the world. Osaka's GDP per capita (Nominal) was $59,958.($1=\\120.13)Historically, Osaka was the center of commerce in Japan, especially in the middle and pre-modern ages. Nomura Securities, the first brokerage firm in Japan, was founded in the city in 1925, and Osaka still houses a leading futures exchange. Many major companies have since moved their main offices to Tokyo. However, several major companies, such as Panasonic, Sharp, and Sanyo, are still headquartered in Osaka. Recently, the city began a program, headed by mayor Junichi Seki, to attract domestic and foreign investment. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Osaka was ranked as having the 15th most competitive financial center in the world and fifth most competitive in Asia (after Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai).The Osaka Securities Exchange, specializing in derivatives such as Nikkei 225 futures, is based in Osaka. The merger with JASDAQ will help the Osaka Securities Exchange become the largest exchange in Japan for start-up companies.According to global consulting firm Mercer, Osaka was the second most expensive city for expatriate employees in the world in 2009. It jumped up nine places from 11th place in 2008 and was the eighth most expensive city in 2007. However, it was not ranked in the top ten places of the list in 2013. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) ranked Osaka as the second most expensive city in the world in its 2013 Cost of Living study.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nGreater Osaka has an extensive network of railway lines, comparable to that of Greater Tokyo. Major stations within the city include Umeda (\u6885\u7530), Namba (\u96e3\u6ce2), Shinsaibashi (\u5fc3\u658e\u6a4b), Tenn\u014dji (\u5929\u738b\u5bfa), Ky\u014dbashi (\u4eac\u6a4b), and Yodoyabashi (\u6dc0\u5c4b\u6a4b).\nOsaka connects to its surrounding cities and suburbs via the JR West Urban Network as well as numerous private lines such as Keihan Electric Railway, Hankyu Railway, Hanshin Electric Railway, Kintetsu Railway, and Nankai Electric Railway.\nThe Osaka Metro system alone ranks 8th in the world by annual passenger ridership, serving over 912 million people annually (a quarter of Greater Osaka Rail System's 4 billion annual riders), despite being only 8 of more than 70 lines in the metro area.\nAll Shinkansen trains including Nozomi stop at Shin-Osaka Station and provide access to other major cities in Japan, such as Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Tokyo.\nRegular bus services are provided by Osaka City Bus, as well Hankyu, Hanshin and Kintetsu, providing a dense network covering most parts of the city.\nOsaka is served by two airports situated just outside of the city, Kansai International Airport (IATA: KIX) which handles primarily international passenger flights and Osaka International Airport (IATA:ITM) which handles mostly domestic services and some international cargo flights.\nDue to its geographical position, Osaka's international ferry connections are far greater than that of Tokyo, with international service to Shanghai, Tianjin, Korea along with domestic routes to Kitakyushu, Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Okinawa.\n\n\n== Culture and lifestyle ==\n\n\n=== Shopping and food ===\nOsaka has a large number of wholesalers and retail shops: 25,228 and 34,707 respectively in 2004, according to the city statistics. Many of them are concentrated in the wards of Chu\u014d (10,468 shops) and Kita (6,335 shops). Types of shops vary from malls to conventional sh\u014dtengai shopping arcades, built both above- and underground. Sh\u014dtengai are seen across Japan, and Osaka has the longest one in the country. The Tenjinbashi-suji arcade stretches from the road approaching the Tenmang\u016b shrine and continues for 2.6 km (1.6 miles) going north to south. The stores along the arcade include commodities, clothing, and catering outlets.\nOther shopping areas include Den Den Town, the electronic and manga/anime district, which is comparable to Akihabara; the Umeda district, which has the Hankyu Sanbangai shopping mall and Yodobashi Camera, a huge electrical appliance store that offers a vast range of fashion stores, restaurants, and a Shonen Jump store.\nOsaka is known for its food, in Japan and abroad. Author Michael Booth and food critic Fran\u00e7ois Simon of Le Figaro have suggested that Osaka is the food capital of the world. Osakans' love for the culinary is made apparent in the old saying \"Kyotoites are financially ruined by overspending on clothing, Osakans are ruined by spending on food.\" Regional cuisine includes okonomiyaki (\u304a\u597d\u307f\u713c\u304d, pan-fried batter cake), takoyaki (\u305f\u3053\u713c\u304d, octopus in fried batter), udon (\u3046\u3069\u3093, a noodle dish), as well as the traditional oshizushi (\u62bc\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, pressed sushi), particularly battera (\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30e9, pressed mackerel sushi).\nOsaka is known for its fine sake, which is made with fresh water from the prefecture's mountains. Osaka's culinary prevalence is the result of a location that has provided access to high-quality ingredients, a high population of merchants, and proximity to the ocean and waterway trade. In recent years, Osaka has started to garner more attention from foreigners with the increased popularity of cooking and dining in popular culture.Other shopping districts include:\n\nAmerican Village (Amerika-mura or \"Ame-mura\") \u2013 fashion for young people\nD\u014dtonbori \u2013 part of Namba district and considered heart of the city\nNamba \u2013 main shopping, sightseeing, and restaurant area\nShinsaibashi \u2013 luxury goods and department stores\nUmeda \u2013 theaters, boutiques, and department stores near the train station\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nOsaka is home to the National Bunraku Theatre, where traditional puppet plays, bunraku, are performed.\nAt Osaka Shochiku-za, close to Namba station, kabuki can be enjoyed as well as manzai.\nAt Shin-kabuki-za, formerly near Namba and now near Uehommachi area, enka concerts and Japanese dramas are performed.\nYoshimoto Kogyo, a Japanese entertainment conglomerate operates a hall in the city for manzai and other comedy shows: the Namba Grand Kagetsu hall.\nThe Hanj\u014d-tei opened in 2006, dedicated to rakugo.

As a result, until 1991 the Osaka area had no schools catering to expatriate children. Osaka International School of Kwansei Gakuin, founded in 1991, is located in nearby Minoh, and it was the first international school in the Osaka area. The Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake of 1995 caused a decline in demand for international schools, as there were about 2,500 U.S. nationals resident in Osaka after the earthquake while the pre-earthquake number was about 5,000. American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) Kansai chapter president Norman Solberg stated that since 2002 the numbers of expatriates in Kansai were recovering \"but the fact is there is still a persistent exodus to Tokyo.\" In 2001 the city of Osaka and YMCA established the Osaka YMCA International School.Colleges and universities include:\n\nKansai University\nMorinomiya University of Medical Sciences\nOsaka City University\nOsaka University of Economics\nOsaka Institute of Technology\nOsaka Jogakuin College\nOsaka Seikei University\nOsaka University of Arts, Minamikawachi District, Osaka\nOsaka University of Comprehensive Children education\nOsaka University of Education\nSoai University\nTokiwakai Gakuen University\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nInternational Institute for Children's Literature, Osaka\nOsaka Prefectural Nakanoshima Library\nOsaka Municipal Central Library\n\n\n=== Learned society ===\nThe Japanese Academy of Family Medicine\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\"Important cultural property\" (\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u5316\u8ca1) after the name of a facility indicates an important cultural property designated by the country.\n\n\n=== Leisure facilities and high-rise buildings ===\n\n\n=== Historic Site ===\nOsaka Castle\nOld Kawaguchi Reservation\nTekijuku (important cultural property)\nRuins of Naniwanomiya Palace\nHirano\nHorijo\n\n\n=== Park/Garden ===\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient architecture ===\nSumiyoshi Taisha main shrine (national treasure)\n\n\n=== Modern architecture ===\nAround Umeda\nOsaka Central Post Office -

          "Tsutenkaku (Or the tower) is an amazing sight to see at night when it glows bright red and changes between two kinds of modes of words along it's side. It was originally meant to mimic the Eiffel Tower and is an interesting tower to learn about after the devastation of WWII and",
          "You hear these phrases when you travel frequently. I've heard, people call Buenos Aires the Paris of South America for example. Tsutenkaku is a new structure, rebuilt after World War II. The original Tsutenkaku was built in 1912, and it shocked the people of that era; with a",
          "This area was filled with streets of shops and restaurants. Lots of Billiken replicas around. Apparently you rub his feet and make a wish. The tower houses the famous god Billiken. He is the god of things as they ought to be. the views from the top level of the tower are",
          "A nice selection of shops and even better choice of little restaurants to try the local dishes Try the puffer fish that was lovely",
          "really liked it. not the best thing to see in the beautiful country of japan but if you hoy to a daytrip to osaka it\u2019s pretty good to see it \ud83d\udc96",
          "It\u2019s in the middle of the busiest crossing in Osaka. It\u2019s next to Tennoji Zoo, Tennoji park and loads of shops and restaurants around!",
          "Really enjoyed our visit here. Amazing neon lights and signs everywhere. Interesting shops and very reasonable prices for restaurants and street foods. Yakitori was about half price of that in Namba Osaka.",
          "This tower looks dated and the interior is not so new. However, it does provided a good view of the surroundings. Entry is via a basement floor, not on street level. You need to walk down a flight of steps from the street entrance.",
          "I have been here before, 2 years ago and this time round, I also came by here except that it was not intentional but was in the vicinity and passed by it. The views of this tower in the day time and night time are so different but I think the night view is nicer with the",
          "Lively place, lots to see, the Canal is Great. Lots of great places to eat. Only drawback....too many tourist.",
          "Touristy area for dining & shopping area. Nice place to sightsee & have some local Japanese food. Good place to buy souvenirs & snacks home for family & friends. Go deeper into the streets to find cheaper dining options where the local dine & drinks.",
          "We visited the tsutenkaku tower during our trip to Osaka. The entrance to tower is something different as you have to go underground level first to reach the ticket boot to take the lift to the top of the tower. They have a lot of cartoon characters displayed on the walk way to",
          "So after they take you to the second floor where there are many vending machines, everyone has to wait in a queue so they can take a photo of you with a tower prop and then sell it to you. If you happen to say no thanks to a clown in his late 20s who\u2019s almost bald wearing",
          "I paid an entrance fee of 800JPY for adult and 400 JPY. As I had been to other towers it can be just the same old experience of looking over the view of the city which is mostly buildings and I did the same in Tokyo, Kyoto now Osaka. This attraction is a mishmash of themes and",
          "We came here to get up the Tsutenkaku tower. As we alighted from the subway, we walked through Shinseikai and entered a shop with lots of old school arcarde games. There are also many interesting shops around. Worth coming for a quick visit. We visited in the day time and we",
          "A quick trip up and worth it for nice pics on a sunny day. We thought the 4th flour was best. Now I understand Glico Man!",
          "Pretty fun area to stroll around and the tower itself is worth a visit as the view from the top repays the entry fee. It also contains a lot of Glico history and products to purchase plus the obligatory capsule toy vending machine arcade. Touristy, yes. Trashy, yes. Worth a",
          "Tsukenkaku is the tower not the neighbourhood. It is the main attraction in shinsekai. The mural underneath is pretty. It makes for a good quick photo. Midday is a good time to go because of where the sun is.",
          "The tower is not that high. Lots of Glicoman story and history if u do get Inside. good neighbourhood to walk around and you still can see some old shops that probably has been around since 1960s. Could spend 1-2h walking. Zoo is next door",
          "We walked through here on our way back to Dotonbori and I don't regret it. We got the quintessential picture with the bustling shop street leading up to the tower. There are several souvenir shops and several restaurants, but the area as a whole seems very touristy so we chose",
          "Tsutentaku is a fun area to spend time. With lots of restaurants and bargin shops it has a slightly gawdy feel but is lively and popular is locals and tourists alike. The tower is a well worth trip up with excellent views of the city and a history of Glico, that I presumes",
          "Quite old, both phisically and mentally. Most exhibitions are not interesting, and the Main aim, as usual, is to sell. But the plastic japanese garden is really shame.",
          "Area around is a lovely place for dinner or lunch depending on the time of the day. Some places close as late as 12am. Tower itself is very old, you can an elevator on the top. View is limited due to tower's hight. Good souvenir shops around. It is much more beautiful from below.",
          "Tsutenkaku is one of my favorite place in Osaka. This place is so Wonderful and have vintage atmosphere.",
          "The 103-meter Eiffel Tower-like built in 1912 retains its ancient style that distinguish it from other modern tower. The observatory location is on the 4th and 5th floors. On the 5th floor we will meet the statue of Billiken, known as the God of Luck. We can go up to the top",
          "Billed as Osaka's Effiel Tower we took a trip up the Tower Later in the Evening, there was no queue when we visited but access was restricted to the lower levels as it was later at night. Fantastic views across the city along with various exhibits telling you the history of the",
          "The view was great but there wasn't really anything to do when you are up there. There are some shops that are great. It was Very Good.",
          "This is another must-visit place when you come to Osaka. You can buy tickets to enter this tower in order to have a look of whole Osaka. Besides, there's also some souvenirs shop inside with many limited edition products, so that we also bought a lot from it!",
          "I guess I could see coming here with friends or kids? There were a lot of themes that felt really disorganized. Animation, space?, the billiken stuff, pocky museum... it was a bit of stimulation overload. Plus it took 30 minutes to get in and I spent about 15 minutes across all",
          "Beautiful, full of lights and colors. An amazing area with nice atmosphere with authentic sushi restaurants and lively nightlife. It's worth arriving",
          "The tower isnt THAT tall, but you still see a good amount around. It was my first time however it\u2019s did not feel like a must, especially not at 800\u00a5. And then they make you go through maybe 6 stores to exit and you have to go through them to get to the next floor\u2019s exit. It\u2019s",
          "Use the Osaka amazing pass for free entrance. The view from the top is meh, considering it's a tower from almost 100 years ago. There's a glico museum inside too. Food around the area is considerably cheaper, and theres a mega don quijote nearby with larger choices of goods and",
          "Tsutenkaku was famous enough, that I asked my friends and some of them had souvenirs from it, or even a Billiken. Yet, not so famous, because I don't recall running into it on this site or others as a 'must see'. Partially, because it isn't in an area to make it must see. Yet,",
          "Tsutenkaku Tower was probably one of my favorite activities in Osaka. It is a super cool and fun experience and once you get to the top observatory deck you can enjoy the 360 views of the city! It has a great souvenir shop and cafe with all kinds of cool options. Near the tower",
          "We went because we purchased the 2days Osaka amazing pass. It was boring. Although it was just a few floors up, the lift ride was slowed down on purpose as they do an introduction of the tower inside the lift. I would recommend just clicking pictures of the tower from Shinsekai",
          "It is a well-known landmark in the Shinsekai district. It has a good view of the surrounding area and also shops inside.",
          "When you are in Osaka remember to visit the Tsutenkaku Tower which is a landmark in the Tsutenkaku neighborhood with a nice view of the city and a large souvenir store. Also, once you are in the neighborhood take a walk around and you will find a variety of entertainment venues",
          "This is not the highest tower but you can still have a good view of the city. 5 floors. We took a JR line from osaka castle to this tower. After reading reviews of how crowded it can get, we decided to visit in the afternoon after vidit to osaka castle. It was practically empty",
          "The tower is not new, but can still feel the greatness and good atmosphere in the area. Food shop are plenty with tasty food.",
          "This place is not quite good to visit. There are not many people and lot of restaurants are closed. There are not many gift shops nor good view.",
          "we took the short train ride from Nama to take a look but I think we went at the wrong time, we arrived just after lunch and although a number of shop were open, there was a number that were closed, it seemed like an area that would be better to visit at night.",
          "It can be a bit crowded, and there isn\u2019t all that much that you can do up there, but it is nice and important historical landmark, and the view is lovely, so do give it a chance ;)",
          "A tower With 30 floors then it overlooking the whole Osaka - it\u2019s covered anyway so it won\u2019t be a threat to those who are afraid of heights . Souvenirs , pocky products can be bought there .",
          "When there by subway. Interesting. Some cheap accomm lots of basic food stalls. Seems to be a real Octopus food specialty. Didn't do tower,but view would be good as not a lot of high rise in area. Keep walking onto Den-Den town nearby to add value to experience.",
          "The name where Tsutenkaku is located is in the Shinseigei shopping and F&B district- one of the markets on our check list for project oishi. The name is \u201d\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\u201d which means \u201cnew world\u201d. In fact the Japanese pronunciation of the place is similar to the way we sat in our Hokkien",
          "The whole area is about street food literally. Choices are a plenty but, in terms of price and quality, I would say that it's just mediocre at best. It's more for the experience of walking and eating at what is considered the most \"dangerous\" neighbourhood",
          "The Tsutenkaku Tower is modelled after the Eiffel Tower and has an observation deck for visitors. The tower is a bit old and run down. The surrounding area has a lot of shops and restaurants. Good place to explore and find delicious food.",
          "Eateries galore in the same area. Avoid lunchtime as it is always full. But food is great. Tsutenkaku offers great viewing experience and a place to take plenty of photos.",
          "Similar vibe to dotonbori but perhaps more authentic. It emanates a more post war vibe and is usually less crowded. Much rather hang out here than in dotonbori to be honest. Long live Tsurenkaku",
          "It was a busy and vibrant spot for convergence of people for meals and drinks. Next to the city zoo.",
          "The area of Shinsekai is itself a lively and vibrant place to wander around in the evening or night time as the place is all lit up and full of people. The tower itself is perhaps less interesting although the views are nice. In Japan we have visited much nicer towers than",
          "Another great part of Osaka that we really enjoyed wandering through just looking, right under the tower and loads to see! We had a load of laughs there too!!",
          "I recently visited the tower at night hoping for spectacular night time skyline views of Osaka, unfortunately all i could see was the reflection of the lights inside which meant I couldn't get a picture without a full reflection. The lower floor had a disco lighting theme",
          "As a resident of Osaka this used to be lovely place to visit many years ago, but now it\u2019s just a hollow Poki shop with a decent view ruined by awful inside lighting. Will never return. Don\u2019t visit.",
          "You will never be bored to walk around in day and night. You will see full of people at all time. You can find all the food and all the shopping need.",
          "It is a symbol of Osaka. There are lots of A Japanese dish of skewered meat shop in the surrounding area. Lighting up at night is very beautiful. Please come and visit Osaka by all means. \u5927\u962a\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30dc\u30eb\u3002\u5468\u8fba\u306b\u306f\u6ca2\u5c71\u306e\u4e32\u30ab\u30c4\u5c4b\u304c\u3042\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3093\u306a\u304a\u663c\u304b\u3089\u5451\u3093\u3067\u307e\u3059\u3002\u591c\u306f\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3055\u308c\u3066\u30ad\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u3059\u3002",
          "its a nice tower, not that bog and not that small too. theres a lot of eateries nearby. we did some shopping also nearby.",
          "We stayed at the Marriott in Tennoji and this market area was just a short walk away and defiantly worth a visit. Full of food shops selling the traditional Osakan cuisine, Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki and Kushikatsu. Great for lunch and a stroll around.",
          "Absolute rubbish. Dated and run down and filled with dodgy attempts to get you to buy crap souvenirs. Visited in the evening and what would have been a beautiful view of Osaka was spoilt because the interior lighting was too bright. The lower observation floor was just bizarre",
          "If you\u2019re in Osaka then this is one of the go to sights. It\u2019s got a great landmark with excellent views over Osaka. It\u2019s colourful and vibrant offering excellent choices for food and drinks as well.",
          "We visited at night as entrance is covered under the Osaka amazing pass. Not very impressive but you do get a good view of the surroundings. From the number of visitors, it is not as popular as other sights. Facilities looks dated.",
          "Nothing impressive. View from the towel is mediocre as compared to other viewing points in Osaka considering its height.",
          "The tower is a little bit crazy but some great views from the top if you don\u2019t mind glitter balls and manga etc",
          "You can enjoy city view by getting on the tower. The tower itself is also a nice spot for sightseeing , with lighting effects at night. There are also lot of restaurants that you can choose.",
          "Don\u2019t expect too much from this tower. Though it\u2019s a landmark of the Shinsekai district, this tower is not very tall, with its observation deck not even reaching 100 meters. You will still get a breathtaking view of the surrounding areas such as Tennoji, but it doesn\u2019t give you",
          "You can get free admission to this site with the Osaka Amazing Pass as well as nearby Shintennoji Temple/Gardens and the Tennoji Zoo. This place has the feeling of an old time tourist trap. That still does not diminish the great views of the Harukasu building, Shinsekai and",
          "Choices of menus around the area included some Korean foods and Ice Bubble Tea. We chose one of Japanese restaurant, prices are ok food are ok",
          "You can find nice views in this area! The best time to go is right before the sunset, so you can appreciate how the lights become alive in the surroundings",
          "One hundred meters high, sixty years of age (built in 1956), located in the Shinsekai district. It is a vulgar and dated tower. The tower might be a landmark in the past, but not anymore now. It is required to pay 700 yen to enter and climb up. Personally, I don't think",
          "The Tsukenkaku is a retro steel observation from the 1950's, built to replace the original structure from 1912. Although an interesting place, it does not have much appeal other than a cramped observation platform at the top. The real attraction here is the area of Shinsekai: a",
          "Visiting free using the osaka amazing pass. The view around the downtown of Shinsekai is just so so.",
          "I wasn't expecting a lot from Tsutentaku but I wanted to visit because I heard there was a Musculman (Kinikuman) exhibition inside and I'm a fan of the series. In the end the exhibition is really small and not that interesting but the tower itself makes for a great visit",
          "There\u2019s a pretty old, old school arcade and some very interesting shops. There\u2019s also a Japanese dojo and Mahjong dojo.",
          "Sure, there are better and higher observation decks in Osaka but after going past this towers for almost 20 years, it was nice to finally go there. Just north of the Dobutsuen-mae subway station, you can find this tower in the \"colourful\" Shin Sekai part of Osaka which was the",
          "We took the subway to this area and walked around for a couple of hours. Fun tourist stores and many local restaurants. Nice area of old Osaka.",
          "This is a nice spot to walk around and take in the cool restaurant designs. The tower is so rich in history that it is great to see. Walk around and take in the feel of this \u201cbad ghetto\u201d area as the Osaka people call it. Catch the tram that runs nearby when you have the",
          "Aesthetically speaking, Tsutenkaku tower isn't anything special. Just a steel tower with some night lights. But the views from the observation deck of the tower are great. It's a nice way to see the Osaka cityscape from a higher perspective but other than that, it's nothing too",
          "The tower is an Osaka icon with plenty of fantastic photo ops from the streets below. Actually going inside, on the other hand, is underwhelming and pricey. Skip the entry fee and buy some local street food. If you're in downtown Osaka you should definitely see the neighborhood",
          "This much older tower looks fine and is right next to the Osaka Zoo. It is a much older vintage tower than the newer, taller Umeda Observation deck. The queue can be quite long, waiting for an hour at peak times is not unusual. The entire time in queue you are surrounded by",
          "A taste of Osaka from yesteryear. Many dining and shopping options and less crowded than Dotonbori which basically offers the same experience. Definitely a must do!",
          "This part of Osaka is considered the \u201cOld Osaka\u201d which has the huge tower that you can get up to the top and see the city. There\u2019s alot of shopping and food stalls and restaurants to choose from.",
          "The area itself has a few interesting streets (and I mean just a few), especially at night for the restaurant entrances but apart from that, not worth it in my honest opinion. It appears to be quite dated and has the feel of an old seaside town whose visitors have long since",
          "I wouldn't have visited it if it hadn't been for free through Osaka Pass. It was not attractive as it looked like the modern era in the 1990s. Redeveloping is not easy. However, if it remains outdated, it could be not a tourist destination but a backward area.",
          "The tower opens at 9am. We got there about half an hour after it opened and by the time we got there it was full of tourists. A person working at the Tower directed us to level 3, where there was an exhibition and archival footage of the history of the tower. The tower had",
          "This is probably one of the most unusual tower experiences I've been to! Visit includes usual viewing platform, disco floor, museum, rooftop garden and pocky memorabilia! Something for everyone and all at a bargain price. Plus we went early evening in cherry blossom season and",
          "If you have time could be nice to ride up un Taukekaku tower where you can admire a nice view from Osaka... however, 700 Japanese yen fee entrance is a bit expensive!",
          "this street is amazing to me and lots of eateries from octopus pancakes balls to seafood BBQ to ramen.. It has also sourviniers shops and lots of cute staffs to bring back home. see the cute car below in the photo.. don't missed this street...",
          "It is fun just to walk around this area, to see those crazy display on the food stall front and neon lights everywhere. It is a good place for food and if you want to shop late at night there is MEGA Don Quijote that open till 5am. Of course there is also an observation deck for",
          "This area is best known for its great restaurants. The tower is worth a visit if you have some time after lunch. The tower is pretty small compared to other big city towers but it does offer good views of the city. Keep your eyes peeled for Osaka Castle. There is a monkey show",
          "This place certainly caters more to tourists over locals. However restaurant prices are not expensive for what you are getting, which is a plus. You won't miss much if you don't come here.",
          "This place was interesting. Lots of little shops with various things. A great way to enjoy Japanese shopping.",
          "I did a half day walking tour of Osaka booked with Viator and this area was part of the tour. The tour was a great way to check out the sights and get your bearings. Glad I went and soaked up the atmosphere I didn't need to go back. It was worth going.",

          "great place to shop and buy gifts and souvenirs.. with a number of small shops for shopping spree...",
          "This is an old tower, a symbol of the area with slow elevators so you need to be patient. The views of the city was nice. You get a closer more detailed view versus being high up in a taller tower. From street level, you walk down stairs, pay, ride up, walk through shops,",
          "As observation towers go, the nearby Abeno Harukas may have a higher-up deck than Tsutenkaku, but is more expensive (1,500 versus 700 yen). And besides, being closer to the ground lets you take in more details of your surroundings! A trip to the outer deck (500 yen extra)",

          "This is old place that you see in some anime. It is older it seems, you can buy stuff and you can eat stuff. I think may be this was better in the past. This is next to the zoo",
          "Not just a fun place, it does tell you the history side of Osaka. Lot of things to do in the tower. You can buy gift. Take photos. Food. Etc...",
          "We got there at 4:30pm so perhaps missed the best of the area, but we didn't linger. Lots of homeless people, a background smell of urine as you walked past side alleys, fairly run down area and not a lot to keep you there. We'd already been up the Umeda sky tower , so no reason",
          "I wouldn't call it all exciting to visit this tower, they have a lot of commercial elements getting you to spend the money.Taking photos, souvenirs and lucky wishes items etc...... However this was not the worst attraction in Osaka. If you walked pass the area, you may as well",
          "This is a traditional Japanese Street with a lot of shops and restaurants. Very beautiful and colourful in the night.",
          "They have really good food there! Especially the takoyaki stalls the ice cream place. Almost everything there is really worth it , it is a must go if you happen to be in osaka",
          "Visited at daytime, this place was quiet and dull. Old shops leads from Station to the tower. Not much to see here if you don't intend to go up to the tower.",
          "Centrally located in the Shinsekai area you will find Tsutenkaku tower. On top of the tower you have great views of the area and Osaka itself. It is absolutely worthwhile to go up and have yourself a look.",
          "Retro is the only way to describe the tower and all the paraphernalia that goes along the way. It's old fashioned, junky, cluttered, and a bit kitsch, a product and survivor of its time - didn't worry us though. Nice to see a bit of old time Japan that is no ultra new nor ultra",
          "The view from the top of the Tsutenkaku was magnificent. Typhoon was approaching when I visited there, but there were a lot of tourists lined up to see the gorgeous view of Osaka. From the top of the tower, I could see a considerable number of beautiful skyscrapers surrounding",
          "My family and I went to Osaka in the Summer of 2016. It was a great family adventure for we didn't know the culture or the language so their was a lot of fumbling around. With that being said it was definitely manageable to get around due to universal signs, numbers and hotel",
          "I got to the observatory in the evening as i wanted to view the sunset & the area of Shinsekai. There was about a dozen people in the elevator so wasn't too crowded but when you get to the observatory you realise it quickly becomes crowded. Why? the observatory area is so small",
          "Had to rush around the area so I can only say i enjoyed taking some pictures and eating typical Japanese cuisine along the way. Had taken lots of pictures with the cute baby-like statues displayed around the area. They said its for luck somehow. I think its worth the visit.",
          "This Tower is a very special place: it is actually located in the center of the crazy, retro-futuristic ward 'ShinSekai' (lit: new world), and it one of the most traditional symbols of Osaka unique popular culture. At the top floor you will find a very special deity: Billiken, a",
          "Afrernoon or evening is always fine to walk around Osaka minami! So many bars restaurants and others entertainment.",
          "From the moment you enter, everything around makes you spend more money. Attraction shouldn't be so aggressive in sale once you bought ticket. Otherwise is decent place with interesting history and old school feeling.",
          "I did not have the chance to climb it, but I went as close as being below it. Compared to other observations I've been, I felt like it was smaller. Loads of restaurants around the area, so many places to eat!",
          "Reasonably priced and good views over Osaka, not too high so you get a different perspective. If you're in the area you might as well visit.",
          "Went there at the end of the day and it was almost closing time so we only saw it from the outside and walked around that area. It is a tower, not very tall, not sure how the views from the top but the buildings around are not tall also. I think there are other higher buildings",
          "This is an iconic tower with observation deck in downtown in Osaka. When I visited at noon on the weekend, there was a queue waiting for 40 minutes, so I gave up going up to the observation deck. There was a souvenir shop in the facility. I took a pictures of the tower from",
          "Went here for Billiken! I knew of him because of a video game (Devil Survivor 2). Billiken, the god of things-as-they-ought-to-be, had a mini exhibit there as well as Glico's Pocky. Tickets to the tower can be bought at the basement. The elevator has some animation that would",
          "Another interesting district to walk though, but lacking the same sense of merriment present in Dotonburi.",
          "The place is good to observe the Naniwa area and Tsutenkaku zoo... The tower is not so high and located near Naniwa street for culinary. This area is far away from the city and less famous for the tourist. Almost local people are coming to here.",
          "We went there when its almost dusk. A nice view for sunset. FREE for Osaka Amazing Pass holder! Its a must as its the image of Old Osaka",
          "It is an older part of town and has quaint restaurants. There was not much activity and as vibrant as Dotonburi or Namba. It has a tower but if you have been to Umeda Sky Building you can skip this one. Nice to visit if you have been everywhere else.",
          "Nothing more than a grey tower under a grey sky make my feeling so grey that I want watch a movie 50 shades of grey...or greys anatomy",
          "When the lights light up at night, it looks rather impressive and pretty. You can stroll the shops around Tsetenkaku. Food wise, not sure if we walked the wrong area but 80% of them are selling kushikatsu.",
          "First you have to join a huge line to go up for the view. But its funny once you arrive on the top you can touch the feet of the god and have a picture of you. Dont forget to make a wish ;)",
          "We could see the Tower from the Tennoji Zoo and we therefore decided to visit the Tower to see the area from the top. But the place was too crowded with shops selling too many merchandise especially Glico products ( Pocky, Pretz and other foodstuffs!) and we quickly went up the",
          "High tower and its spectacular sight mat not much exciting to many rooftop viewers but it's the tower and its more than century old story that has been presented in the cinema room that leaves me in wonder of how Osaka has been shaped.",
          "The tower is based on the Eiffel Tower in Paris but it doesn't have its elegance. The interior is dated, however the views from the top are good.",
          "There are lots of eating places around Tsutenkaku, i do recommend coming at dusk when its starting to get dark as you'll see the awesome Tsutenkaku tower. It gets busy at night with all the young people out and about but its great to experience that atmosphere.",
          "This part of Osaka is a nice surprise. Lots of places to eat. Large restaurants to small stand only places. The streets are colorfully decorated and the tower is brilliant at night.",
          "This is an ugly looking tower, located at the end of Tennoji park, next to a so-so neighborhood. We felt no need to get to the top of the tower as the place looked rather dated.",
          "Many visitors wishing to rub the soles of Billiken's feet mean queues at this symbol of Osaka. It's all quite hectic, crowded and commercialised. The tower has appeared in movies and the visit offers photo opportunities, get dressed up, pose in front of Billiken, smile and then",
          "We went there during the evening and there was no line. You have to go down a flight of stairs, then you ride an elevator up. If you have a student I.D. even from another country, they accept giving you a few hundred yen off on admission. The city view from the observation area",
          "This is walking distance (around a kilometer) from our hotel near JR Shin Imamiya. Very touristy nonetheless it is a must to take your photo of the tower that changes colors in seconds.",
          "We went to the Tower area to visit a business associate. We walked around the tower area for quite some time It is a very busy location with tons of things to see and do. Everything from peep shows to high end clothing. Restaurants by the scores and lots of people to watch.",
          "We visited for free as we had the 2d Osaka pass.Place is dated,and nostalgic.Tower is not very tall but you get a 360 view of the city.Looks rather old and dated like in the 70s era. The staff are polite in directing the visitors.Entrance is in B1.After the ticket counter is",
          "The history of this tower is very interesting and you'll learn all about it on your visit. The views of Osaka are just amazing! Put it on your list of sights to see when in Osaka.",
          "Having been to Umeda sky tower and back again with friends who have never been to Osaka we decided to visit Tsutenkaku instead. bad decision. The view was okay - not as high or spectacular as Umeda - but okay. The rest of the experience I couldn't decide if I was in a theme park",
          "The very first tower I saw up close and personal in Kansai -- because it was well within Hotel Taiyo's comfort radius. Spot was basically about 2 blocks away from where my wife and I stayed for the night. Tsutenkaku, to me, is like the mini Eiffel Tower.",
          "Jus stumbled upon this space needle type tower...rode up the capsule...GREAT VIEW of city...and got to rub Billiken-San feet for good luck!",
          "Having some time to kill, decided to go visit shinsaiken and the tsutenkaku tower. Nothing really exciting here and pretty dated place. There are some shows and comedy acts but all in Japanese so probably more suited to local tourist or kids on an outing.",
          "Special quarter in Osaka with a lot of old shops and eateries. I happened to stay at a nearby hostel and went there before heading to Kyoto.",
          "This place is located at Shinsekai.. So while you stroll around Shinsekai, just drop by this place to have a little view of whole Osaka from its observation deck. The fee is \u00a5700 and it will be better if you go with at least a friend. I went there at noon so nothing's really",
          "Nice view on top of the tower. Went there on Christmas Day and the queue was pretty long. Not sure about other time though. Once you are up there, there's not much to do except for seeing the Osaka skyline. Lots of sponsored activities. They seem to have squeezed every square",
          "I recently had the pleasure of being brought here by my Japanese friend to appreciate the autumn colors of Osaka. The viewing decks are large, there is a wide array of souvenirs and food choices to choose from which were very conveniently located. I also got to see how big the",

          "It's not worth the trip. Seriously. Waste of time and entrance fee. I only went there cos it was nearby my airbnb place and I had the osaka amazing pass. I felt it was a waste of time and energy. Had already gone to umeda sky building, so this is nothing in comparison. This",

          "This tower is built since 100 years ago when Shinsekai area was being built up, you can together know more about the Japanese history during that period when visiting this tower. Good to visit around evening or night time.",

          "Filled with characters ranging from Hello Kitty to others I am not familiar with, this Tower was well worth the visit, especially if you have the Osaka 2-Day Pass with its numerous tickets and vouchers. If you love Japanese characters, the walk up to the tower is also worth it.",
          "This is an old town inthe southof osaka. The Hitachi tower area had a lot of sushi and resurant.I like the RUKO sushi shop. The fish is fresh and rice very tasty. I went there for my dinner nightly.",

          "went through a long queue (about 2 hours) to see the view, but i will have to say there was nothing much to impress, tourists who wanted a good view of osaka should have gone to umeda sky building instead (breathtaking!)",
          "Waiting in line to go up is not so nice but there are good views from up above. It comes free with the 'Osaka Amazing Pass'. The plus point of this attraction is the surrounding area which is much less touristy. Two subway stops within 5-10 minutes walk but make sure you follow",
          "The view is OK, but it's not worth the long lines and wait to get it. Extremely commercialized. While you are waiting for-ever, they're constantly trying to sell you things -- even on the way out.",

          "I was really looking forward to visiting this tower but it fell short of expectations. It was very commercialised and we didn't enjoy it.",
          "Kinda felt like the 70s in Japan. Old School Arcades, retro architecture and fun kinda street food. There is original Osaka KushiKatsu and Okonomiyaki here too! Interesting are to say the least, and well worth a quick visit.",
          "The Tsutenkaku Tower in Shinsekai itself is not particularly mind-blowing (Tokyo Tower, Sky Tree, Tokyo Govt. Bldg Observation Deck, Umeda Sky Building, Abeno Harukas - are for tower appreciators). Heading up at night will give you a panoramic view of Southern Osaka. The",
          "We were lucky to reach 5 minutes before the tower closes and we were allowed inside. It was part of our Osaka pass and I really found this place fun! First the view on the city in the night was great and I found the building god super fun. He had different faces, they were",
          "Tsutenkaku can be found in Shinsekai and is free with the Osaka Amazing pass. I am not sure I would recommend paying for this as it isn't all that high and reminds me of a run down Vegas casino. It is certainly past its prime but it is unique. If you have the Osaka Pass, go for",

          "This has to be the best tower I've been to in Osaka. Although you have to pay before you could climb up the tower, it was a wonderful experience. They offer student discounts, just show your university ID. I only paid 500 JPY, instead of the usual 700 JPY fee for adults. The top",
          "The tower is not consider high if compared with other tall towers in the world. However, if you have extra time in Osaka, spend a short time to visit this tower to view the Osaka city. If the pay another extra 500 yen, you can enter the highest floor open area to enjoy the",

          "This is an interesting tower. Not so high, but has great views of surrounding area including Tennoji Zoo. Can see all the small streets. This tower has great history that dates back about 100 years, where it was build just as an attraction. Was destroyed in the war, and the",
          "While the view over Osaka was very nice i must say that we visited quite a few observation towers in Japan and this was definitely not my most favourite and i really think that it is due to the feeling of being within a tourist trap when you are lining up for the elevator to the",
          "Nice small area to have a picture that makes you look very in Osaka. Also you can eat blow fish and different kinds of sushi and sashimis. Including the soft shell turtle which couldn't try. You can see them out of the restaurant in a tanks. Also a place to buy some souvenirs.",
          "Luckily it was part of the Amazing pass, but it was a place that I wanted to go. The whole place feels like a tourist trap, once you exit from the first lift, you are made to walk around the shop before you can take the next lift for the observatory. I was walking with a limp",
          "I like how when you queue up to get on the elevator and there are a lot of cute little things (like gift store,Capsule Toy machine... ) to get your attention, then you won't feel the time pass when you line up. When you get up to the Tsutenkaku, you will see the best view ever,",
          "Great area to wander around amongst thousands of typical small Japanese eateries. Mostly covered arcades and not too touristy.",

          "This little 'museum' is tucked away on a small residential street. You won't find it unless you are looking for it. You feel like you are entering someone's home. Once inside, the sweet older lady and gentlemen took great delight first in demonstrating, then asking us to play",

          "This museum was a slight deviation off our planned path, but it was worth it! There were rows and rows of table with traditional handmade japanese toys that you could touch and play with! Some of them had really clever mechanical designs even as a children's toy. This place",

        "wiki": "Fushimi Inari-taisha (\u4f0f\u898b\u7a32\u8377\u5927\u793e) is the head shrine of the kami Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. The shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named Inari which is 233 metres (764 ft) above sea level, and includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines which span 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) and take approximately 2 hours to walk up.Inari was originally and remains primarily the kami of rice and agriculture, but merchants and manufacturers also worship Inari as the patron of business. Each of Fushimi Inari-taisha's roughly thousand torii was donated by a Japanese business.\nOwing to the popularity of Inari's division and re-enshrinement, this shrine is said to have as many as 32,000 sub-shrines (\u5206\u793e bunsha) throughout Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe shrine became the object of imperial patronage during the early Heian period.  In 965, Emperor Murakami decreed that messengers carry written accounts of important events to the guardian kami of Japan. These heihaku were initially presented to 16 shrines, including the Inari Shrine.From 1871 through 1946, Fushimi Inari-taisha was officially designated one of the Kanpei-taisha (\u5b98\u5e63\u5927\u793e), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.\n\n\n=== Structures ===\nThe earliest structures were built in 711 on the Inariyama hill in southwestern Kyoto, but the shrine was re-located in 816 on the request of the monk K\u016bkai.  The main shrine structure was built in 1499. \nAt the bottom of the hill are the main gate (\u697c\u9580, r\u014dmon, \"tower gate\") and the main shrine (\u5fa1\u672c\u6bbf, go-honden). Behind them, in the middle of the mountain, the inner shrine (\u5965\u5bae, okumiya) is reachable by a path lined with thousands of torii. To the top of the mountain are tens of thousands of mounds (\u585a, tsuka) for private worship.\n\n\n==== Senbon Torii ====\nThe highlight of the shrine is the rows of torii gates, known as Senbon Torii. The custom to donate a torii began spreading from the Edo period (1603 \u2013 1868) to have a wish come true or in gratitude for a wish that came true. Along the main path there are around 1,000 torii gates.\n\n\n== Fox ==\nFoxes (kitsune), regarded as the messengers, are often found in Inari shrines. One attribute is a key (for the rice granary) in their mouths.\nUnlike most Shinto shrines, Fushimi Inari-taisha, in keeping with typical Inari shrines, has an open view of the main object of worship (a mirror).\nA drawing in Kiyoshi Nozaki's Kitsune: Japan's Fox of Mystery, Romance and Humor in 1786 depicting the shrine says that its two-story entry gate was built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nThe shrine draws several million worshipers over the Japanese New Year, 2.69 million for 3 days in 2006 reported by the police, the most in western Japan.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe shrine is just outside the Inari Station on the Nara Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR), a five-minute ride from Kyoto Station. It is a short walk from Fushimi-Inari Station on the Main Line of the Keihan Electric Railway.The shrine is open 24 hours with both the approach to the shrine and the Honden (\u672c\u6bbf, main hall) itself illuminated all night. There is no entrance fee.\n\n\n== Environs ==\nIn the approach to the shrine are a number of sweet shops selling tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905), a form of fortune cookie dating at least to the 19th century, and which are believed by some to be the origin of the American fortune cookie.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nMemoirs of a Geisha (2005)\nAria the Natural ep. 5 (2006)\nInari, Konkon, Koi Iroha (2010)\nRurouni Kenshin, site of Makoto Shishio's base\nKamen Rider Fourze ep. 33 (2012)\nSamsara (2011 film) (2011)\nHigh School Inari Tamamo-chan' ', where the main character a fox spirit came from along with her siblings.

          "We loved our visit here - so intriguing to see so many gates! We also found it reasonably pleasant walking in the shade on such a hot summer day. The gates are amazing and super impressive!",
          "This was one of the highlights of my trip to Kyoto. Easy access from the train. A bit of a hike but I was about to do it all in just over an hour with a couple of breaks. The journey is more scenic than the destination in this case. Lots of shrines along the way and nice views",

          "Have been here twice; usually crowded but well worth it. Take a look down the side paths -there are some interesting site (wood carver's shack, other views of the city, etc). The food vendors as you exit towards the Keihan line are worth a look too.",
          "Even with the crowds, and yes there probably will be crowds, at least at the base of the shrine, the Fushimi Inari experience is quite magical. What makes the Japanese shrines so interesting is the active participation that still goes on today, and that you can be a part of it",
          "To get the best experience here, I'd highly suggest hiking up to the summit and back. You'll escape the insane crowds at the base, and find yourself having a very peaceful walk through this beautiful shrine. I'd also recommend checking out the various side shrines scattered",

          "If you are in Kyoto, you have to visit this shrine! I was staying right down the street, so I did the climb more than once. It only took about an hour round trip for me, but I do hike often. Going up at night is worth it for the view of Kyoto from about halfway up. But do keep",
          "The walk up the fushimi inari was breathtaking both at night and in broad daylight. I would recommend to go at daytime because at night it might be too dark and also scary with the monkeys and boars closeby. You should try two distinct routes for going up and down again, one",

          "It's a lot of stair climbing but worth it if your up for the hike. Great views and it should be on your list of in town. Easily accessible via the Nara train line with you can use your JR pass to ride for free",
          "bloody amazing place..but crowded...better go early..to avoid the hundred of people slowing down the walking to take selfies(annoying)..but has kind of magical peaceful sensation..nice to get out of the colums \"tunnel\" and look from outside..some hidden interesting areas..but",
          "Open to public at all times, free and close to the Inari station, few minutes away from Kyoto. Totally worth the visit, we were lucky that there were not many visitors at that time.",
          "A great piece of Japanese culture, ideal for holiday photos. Nice and quiet early in the morning before the crowds arrive.",
          "This shrine is very crowded because it is famous and have no entrance fee. But if you walk bit further you can enjoy this shrine, because most of them only want to take photo in the famous torii. The path is actually quite long and steep, it is larger than expected so allocate",
          "My second visit to this shrine and it was still impressive and memorable. This time we chose to walk all the way to the top and it was certainly worthwhile. Along the way there will be times when it is so crowded with other tourists, but then you will find times when it feels",
          "Amazing experience and a must do activity when in Kyoto - be warned it takes a good hour or two to get to the top, but it's a fun trek! Highly recommend!",
          "Despite tourist numbers being low, Fushimi was still extremely crowded but the higher you go the less selfie sticks there are. We got a bit lost, the signs aren\u2019t so helpful at the halfway point but we did seem to go to the top along a path not many others used as the descent",
          "I would recommend hiking all the way on top of Mount Inari, and not just taking photos of the vermillion gates. Older Japanese people have more energy than me! Hehe",
          "We went here at night and it was a fabulous experience! The poles cast shadows in the light. A highlight of our trip.",
          "Great visit, well worth the time and the long walk! Don\u2019t despair after the first climb It is something unique in the world! Simply amazing",
          "It\u2019s cool for the gates and the little shrines on the way. Once you get to the top there\u2019s a view of the city. But not my favorite. It\u2019s very busy so hard to get pictures. Not sure it was worth my time.",
          "So this is the \u201cInstagram\u201d picture everyone wants. Thousands of bright orange Torii heading up the mountain. It\u2019s not much fun as a result. There are a few great picture opportunities and it is probably much nicer to spend the 2 hours or so and walk to the top. We didn\u2019t have",
          "This is a large temple with a walkway of tori gates leading up the hill, which is an impressive sight. It is a very popular and busy place, but the further up the hill you go the less people you see. It is very close to the JR Inari station so this is a very convenient way to",
          "I think only people who believe in shrines should visit for us it was tiring and the views from the top of the mountain well nothing to write home about. Waste of time.",
          "Iconic landmark for Kyoto. Many orange torii gates, it goes on and on. Very good exercise to stay away from city and walk up the hill. There are many food stalls before the temple, so u can come have a bite before or after the hike.",
          "This is an iconic place to visit whilst in Kyoto. Beautiful picture opportunities but a long climb so make sure you bring comfortable shoes!",
          "Make sure to get there early before the crowds come! We started climbing before 7am and there were several people at the base and already climbing as well. We were in a little bit of a hurry so we hiked straight up and down, stopping only for a picture or two, and we were able",
          "Visiting here is like visiting some great catherdal in Europe. You can feel the history, and the spiritual connection here to the mountain. It's open 24 Hours a day, so you can visit in the day time, the night, or early morning. Be warned, at night time there are monkeys",
          "Went there early morning, alone, and had two hours for myself. I believe that experience would be totally different seeing it packed with tourists, because this place gets really packed. This is a must. There is a lot a walk around, but it is so magical that you don't want to",
          "You must head here if coming to Kyoto. Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds! It\u2019s remarkable to see and also a work out. You can get drinks along the way as there are lots of little places to stop.",
          "We went for the climbing on Fushimi Inari on a very hot day in Summer and our daughters were reluctant to go over. However, after few steps under the orange arches they became enthusiast and did all the climb up and down (probably ca 2.5 hours with few stops for photos). There",
          "This shrine was beautiful! The walk to the summit is quite long and challenging (about 80 flights of stairs) although you can walk as little or as much as you like. So if you are strapped for time, I personally do not believe that you will be missing out in any way by not",
          "I cannot express enough how massive the site is. Allow yourself at least 3 hours if you want to hike the entire Shrine. Wear comfy shoes, tennis shoes and bring water with you and be ready for 12, 000 steps. This shrine is massive and crowded but somehow very peaceful and",
          "You could spend all day following the trails to the top of the mountain. We went only about a third up the mountain, but it was beautiful and peaceful. Each gate is donated by a family across Japan. It may have been less crowded the further up you go, but we didn\u2019t have enough",
          "This is an amazing place - miles and miles of orange shrines climb the mountain and make for an incredible visit. The shrine is free to access, located very near a train station in Kyoto and visitors can downed as much time as they like at the site. We opted for the full",
          "This is one of the best places to visit in all japan for sure! It was a really good experience, perfect to go with family and friends and easy to get there.",
          "The Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of Inari, the god of rice, sake and prosperity and patron of business, merchants and manufacturers. The shrine is at the base of Mount Inari and includes many smaller sub shrines. At the shrine\u2019s entrance we saw the Romon (tower)",
          "This is one of the must visit places in Kyoto. Getting here is kind of weird with it being just a few blocks away from the city, but when you see it, it is unmistakable. Beautiful place to explore and take photos. When we went there were tons of food stalls that had a lot of",
          "A \"must visit\" when in Kyoto. You can go up halfway but the best part comes afterwards on the \"round-trip\" to the top and down again. Less tourists there.",
          "Plan to spend some extra time here so you can keep walking until the crowds abate. Spectacular sight.",
          "It was my dream to come here one day, so when we were there early (8:00) to beat the crowd, I was so happy that there were only a couple of people. Plenty of opportunity to take photos, especially if you go a bit uphill. A lot of people stay at the beginning. We walked through",
          "This was pretty good, the seemingly endless orange walkways. Loads of people. Didnt see any of the much warned about monkeys",
          "This shrine was one of the highlights of our time in Kyoto. Its much more extensive than we realized, with walking trails way up into the mountain with lookouts over the city. Most tourists get stuck at the entrance taking their selfies but the crowds are wild here and you",
          "We went to Kyoto between Christimas and New Year's and went here as part of an afternoon tour through Sunrise Travel. We were late for the tour and had to take a cab to catch up to it so we walked through this area very quickly. It is beautiful with all of the gates and as you",
          "We walked the shrine path- gorgeous orange gateways and joined in the traditional walk with those who came on pilgrimage to set the tone of the new year, It is tradition to walk the gateway path to bring in good luck and abundance for your business. There are older shrine that",
          "The shrine is a great experience and workout if you're keen to go to the top. Located directly outside the Inari train station (JR line, 2 stops from Kyoto). We got there early around 7.30am there was maybe 2 other groups ahead of us. Best time to get some unrestricted photos of",
          "We arrived at Fushimi Inari around 6pm, so it's not yet that dark, but not really light as well... a twilight of sorts and it was magical (check the photo). I recommend visiting at around this time as there's not much crowd, plus the view is so, shall we say \"instagram-worthy\".",
          "Fushimi Inari made me visited it 3 times. The gates were so cool, mysterious and instagramable. The shrine was very nice. Even the street food were so delicious from slice pork belly, mochi, chicken, and so on",
          "Another one of Kyoto's amazing gems. The Inari gates you see all over Instagram and social media are located through out the mountain. Best advice is to visit early if you want nice pictures without people in the background. The hike up was quite the workout but there are some",
          "This is mandatory place for first timer. Always crowded. Many locals too, because the temple have a regular schedule of praying time",
          "This was the place i wanted to go and didn't want to miss. I loved loved loved it! Going early, in the mist of the morning almost empty. It was just beautiful.",
          "This should be on your list to visit! It's a lovely place to walk around and is a lot bigger than you would imagine. We got the train here and the station is directly opposite and about a minute walk away. Walking around this site is really nice and there were hardly any",
          "It really nice to walk trough the area, especially trough the torii gates. The only negative thing was the hustle and bustle in general, because during my visit it was very crowded. So I didn\u2018t spend that much time in there and increased the pace a bit.",
          "A long walk if you can tackle the whole mountain unfortunately we only made it half way but still a nice experience , good culture and a few photo spots ... you will need to time it right tho as there are lots of visitors here A",
          "Great photo opportunities and a bit of early morning exercise. There are several temples to see as you go round. It was easy to get to on a train from Kyoto Station only 10mins.",
          "Detour from Osaka, more or less an hour of train ride to the Fushimi-Inari Station. Definitely one of the key attractions when you think of Kyoto. Crowded as expected. And the thousands of tore gates were definitely spectacular.",
          "Had been looking forward to this visit for years and it did not disappoint. Be sure to wear walking shoes.",
          "After a 30 year relationship with Japan, I am not sure how I have never been here. My hint, go early. I arrived at about 8:30 on a Saturday and by the time I got up and down (I ate icecream at the top and had a sit down to admire the scenery),which was around 10:45/11, it was",
          "There are many temples and shrines in Japan. Fyi, Temples are for Buddhist worship while shrines are for Shintoism worship. Fushimi Inari is therefore a Shinto shrine but unique with its never ending sea of iconic red/orange torri style gates arching over the pathway which in",
          "A sight to see when in Kyoto. Make sure you come very early so you can get better picture with lesser crowd.",
          "This shrine offers endless steps up to the top of the hill with gates most of the length. A busy place (at least at weekend) but worth the effort. Easily reached by JR only a couple of stops from Kytot to Inari. You do not need to go to the top to experience the shrine but",
          "Beautiful shrines and gates, plus the mountain makes a wonderful hike if you have time. There's even a bamboo forest here for great photo ops",
          "It was night time when we went, so we had it to ourselves for taking photos though cannot appreciate other surroundings.",
          "A tedious climb up the steps all the way to the peak (~400m) in about 2hrs but sadly you don\u2019t get very good views at the top but an achievement though. You get to see some souvenir shops along the way up and back down. The only good thing is that the higher you climb the lesser",
          "My absolute favorite attraction in Kyoto, and maybe all of Japan. When you enter Fushimi Inari, you are greeted with the tori gates with a big orange building with shinto foxes on both sides. This is the iconic picture of it, and one might be forgiven for thinking this is where",
          "As we walked out from Fushimi Inari Station, we followed the crowds and took some pics of the big lovely temple in front of the station, with its majestic torri gate. Then, we walked along a small street with many quaint Japanese houses and came across a food section where many",
          "Came with our 16 month toddler. We made it all of the top while carrying the stroller (not kidding). I felt like I was going to die climbing all those stairs up and down. Absolutely incredible sight and journey but make sure your kids can handle about 3 hour journey on their",
          "We decided to visit Fushimi inari at night. It wasnt scary at all. however, we managed to climbed our way to 1/2 way to the top just a little after Mitsusuji and a wild boar saw me. it screamed an angry voice and ran towards me. I paniced and quickly ran back down. \"That's it,",
          "Been here twice and on my 2nd visit, I finally had the time to try and go to the top. It took me a lot (I mean a lot of stops) to reach the praying area to the top but the experience was worth it (not necessarily the view). I love the Kyoto merch around the area as it captures",
          "Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine is positively breathtaking, and also extremely popular! As you head farther towards the top, the crowds thin out and the views out over Kyoto are impressive. Note that the little refreshment/gift shops you see as you go along the path are all owned by",
          "In place more identically with orange gate. Many people very insteresting to this place since entrance until end of that area. You can enjoy arrround this place, hunting food or trying yukata.",
          "Worth checking out. We did the walk to the top of the mountain. It's pretty much more of the same from a shrine perspective but you get a good view of Kyoto and can see Osaka in the distance on a clear day. The walk up the mountain has a fair few steps so that's worth taking",
          "This shrine was very easy to access ... the entrance is literally across the street from the metro station, and we had japan rail passes so the trip was free for us. The shrine is beautiful .. if you arrive early enough the crowds aren't too bad. As we were leaving the crowds",
          "This is a great way to begin your Kyoto experience. Use the JR Nara line and go to Inari station from Kyoto station- very close. There is a fair amount of easy climbing but well worthwhile experiencing the orange Nori gates . Go early as the grounds get super crowded by late",
          "This area is 5 minutes walk from the JR station but it can get very crowded during the day as the tour buses come in The are a is open 24/7 and there's no entry charge if you don't mind crowds then go during the day ,but we found that around 10pm was the best time to visit",
          "It was a short train trip from Kyoto Station to JR Inari Station. We visited the shrine in the evening. The entrance gate looked beautiful. The orange torri gates were fascinating. Couldn't stop taking photo.",
          "What a beautiful walk through the orange \"gates\". I wish we had more time to make it to the top. Stunning views from the higher points, makes for beautiful photos and an absolute must in Kyoto. We were lucky to be there in late December when the crowds were minimal.",
          "It was fun exploring area. It was late when we got here and did not have the chance to reach the temple at the end of these gates.",
          "It\u2019s so popular to visit this place and cause of that really crowded. That\u2019s why we went there a second time in the late evening and enjoyed that a lot and could taken great pictures",
          "Top place to visit in Kyoto. Free entrance (it is respectful to make an offering) and parking. Main temple complex at base of hill then its 12,000 steps up a pretty arduous climb to the top of the hill through the 10,000 gates. Lots of small shrines all the way up and around the",
          "Tourists arrive by the bus load and it\u2019s like a production line. Out of frustration we deviated and took a small path to the summit (climb via the right hand side of the mountain...anti-clockwise) fortunately it was the best decision - we could reach the summit without being",
          "This is a must do while in Kyoto. We did the full loop/hike all the way to the top of Mt Inari. It\u2019s 12,000 steps, and quite the uphill hike. The torri gates that line the trail are so cool to walk through. There are shrines and small shops along the way. Bring water and good",
          "Make sure to arrive before 8 to avoid the crowds. the trail itself is around three miles and goes up through the mountains with orange torii Gates the entire path. The views of Kyoto from the top are stunning! The trails very peaceful if you don't have a ton of people around",
          "I came here in the afternoon, and sadluy the stalls are closing down already. Plus the sun is setting so pictures are hard to take with phones. I suggest coming here early in the morning or while the sun is up. It's crowded here for people come and pray plus tourists gather to",
          "Try to climbe up to the mountain to enjoy beautiful sunset! Experience the unique atmosphere when walking through the mountain route during the time. The reflection of the light is amazing! Highly recommanded!",
          "This was our last stop in Kyoto as we noted that it was open 24 hours! We got there after 8 pm and there were not many people around but the whole area was lighted enough for you to walk around and hike! We learnt that there are over 1000 Shinto shrine archways. As we started,",
          "We went for a night trip to this shrine and trust me, the atmosphere is totally different. It was quieter and more peaceful at night plus the lighting around the gates were simply splendid. If you\u2019re looking to pray/give respects to the temple, you should definitely hit up after",
          "The place had a positive aura about it. The gates were magnificent and the cultural significance of the gates indicating fulfilled wishes added to the hope and positivity of the place. Breath taking views, lots of good eating and souvenir shops around.Well connected by the train.",
          "Th is place is amazing. Went on a Saturday so very busy - markets are fantastic and the BBQ stalls are sensational!!!!",
          "Wear comfy shoes and make the effort to climb to the top. There are interesting little graveyards along the way. We went at sunset and were not disappointed. Many photo opportunities.",
          "A trip to Kyoto is incomplete without visiting Fushimi Inari Taisha! From Arashimaya station, we took the JR train to Inari Station for our next itinerary, the Fushimi Inari Taisha. We started our walking tour from the shrine which sits at the base of the Mt Inari by walking",
          "Very, very busy around the entrance to the shrine but the crowds soon thin out as you ascend. A stunning site once away from the crowds, it makes for pleasant walk . Allow 2-3 hours to the top and back",
          "I have no idea how people get these gorgeous photos with just themselves. We went at night because we ran out of time. There's a colony of cats that live there that we got to cuddle which was cute.",
          "Unique traditional structures on long winding slopes of Mt Imari. Nice pond scenery near the top of the mountain.",
          "Rising up the mountain, this is a huge and spectacular temple. Climbing to the highest peak is not for the faint hearted. But half way up you get great views of Kyoto.",
          "30-45 min walk along the trail to the view point , if you go after 4pm less crowd and better. Really amazing shrine.",
          "Definitely this is a place to not to miss when in Kyoto.... we were luck it was not so crowed because I\u00b4ve seen pictures where it was completely full. Wonderfull experience. The energy and calm you can feell it..... priceless.",
          "Yes, one must visit Fushimi Inari if in Kyoto. It\u2019s beautiful and impressive. Best time to visit is early in the morning to avoid buses of tourists. Wear comfortable walking shoes.",
          "When we started the climb the area was packed with people. Everyone was trying to get their selfies and I thought this is going to be horrendous. However, we took the path less traveled through a bamboo grove around the back of the mountain and up a very steep track. The good",
          "The beginning of this walk will be packed to the brim with people but the further you climb the mountain, the quieter it\u2019ll get. Get ready for a lot of stairs if you want to head to the top, but it\u2019s worth it for the tranquility along the way.",
          "What a great place to visit when you want some tranquillity time. The closest station I believe was Inari station. You can walk to the top which takes just under an hour I but I\u2019m slightly unfit. Take some water with you as you can buy water and other soft drinks near the top",
          "Loved this Shrine and I made a wish while I washing my hands and my mouth at the holy well ! Really want my wish to come true , so I can return !!! Indigenous holy Japanese shrine!!",
          "Such a great place to visit! All the surrounding areas are stunning too. The walk to the top isn\u2019t the easiest but totally worth it as it\u2019s far quieter than the very busy touristy end.",
          "Beautiful shrine, with all the Torri gate,We enjoyed going through, it was very impressive, sorry we didn't have time to climb to the top.",
          "It's said that this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan, and I can believe it: we were there on a cold day in December and the place was absolutely swarming. I hardly dare contemplate what it must be like in the high season. However, don't let that put you",
          "This shrine is one of the more famous shrines due to the number of Torri gates on the property. The shrine itself is lower on the mountain and the Torri gate pathway starts there. It is a little bit of an uphill walk with steps to get to the shrine, so keep that in mind.",
          "One of the most beautiful shrine in Kyoto. Entry was free but was crowded. We didn't walk too much due to the crowd.",
          "Cool from a design, look, cultural and activity perspective. Takes a couple of hours at least to get the full value of the walk and views. Top site in Kyoto.",
          "Due to our schedule, and a desire to avoid crowds, we came in the evening after dark which turned out to be a great choice. Got the JR line from Kyoto centre and the entrance was just over the road. At night this place no doubt has a very different feel, all lit up by lanterns.",
          "Saw this in the guidebook and thought that the red/orange arches were limited to one part, but no they stretch the whole way around. It\u2019s a long way and uphill too so you have to be fairly fit to get to the top - or very determined. Great exercise with a good view with",
          "No words can describe the beaty of this site. Mind to schedule a visit for half a day and try to avoid the crowds to the maximum. You'll enjoy this wonder even more.",
          "It\u2019s close proximity to the Kyoto station. Went almost towards the evening but it was still crowded. But then again it\u2019s free so it\u2019s worth it unlike other places in Kyoto where you pay only to find that you are just walking around the places without even getting the feel of",
          "Wonderful place to visit. Allocate at least 2 hours to navigate hill and see all the gates. Take left route to avoid crowds. Much better photo opportunities on the way down. Wonderful, not to be missed.",
          "We went at night. It was beautiful! I\u2019m gutted that I can\u2019t read Nihonggo coz there are writings on the torii gates! It was amazing walking through thousands of torii gates!",
          "An absolute must whilst in Kyoto! We went in the early afternoon via train from Kyoto station. The train was quite crowded but as everyone lined up in an orderly fashion and 90% of the passengers were getting on at Kyoto station and off at Inari station, it wasn\u2019t an issue with",
          "Breath taking place, maps are all over the area so you know where you are, i strongly encourage you to hike all the way up, its not a hard hike, just take your time. Its very serene up there and its a nice photo place.",
          "Fushimi Inari is open 24hrs...so...it's not a problem if you want to visit but you only have a time at night..just like me, i visit fushimi inari at night..hehe..not many people at night visit fushimi inari, so you can walking around fushimi inari with ease..",
          "I must say I picked the wrong time to visit it would be nicer if I visit some other time not a peak weak like New Year. The magic of the red collar still there even overwhelm by the river of people. I will come back again to have a picture as the Memoir of Geisha movie.",
          "we were there right before New Years, a huge holiday in Japan, so it was plenty busy, but it was still inspiring and well worth it",
          "If you go early isn't crowded and you can enjoy it more, the climb will take about 1 hour or more if you make stops",
          "Lovely attraction, starts off very busy through the first part of gates then dissipates thank goodness",
          "After reading reviews, we arrived at the later half of the day, thinking there would be less crowd. Unfortunately, it was still very crowded. There were also large numbers of tour groups that added to the numbers. The place itself is really nice and as majestic as the photos",
          "Visited on 2 January 2020 during the holiday season here and boy it was packed which in a way added to the experience. Honestly it\u2019s a hike up a mountain through 10,000 gates with a great view of Kyoto on the way up. However it is very touristy now but still worth the walk.",
          "Though it is crowded the temple and the gates are amazing. It drizzled and so I didnt go uphill it became slippery and muddy. Be sure to check the weather first. Below the temple are the mini shops and food booths. I tried most of the street foods and they were all taste good",
          "This legendary temple is way beyond what you could expect, from readings and movies. The purest air, on the top of a mountain, a 4 km walk through the ascendant path of the wooden platform built by and for ancient monks, the shrines waiting silently for your offerings (a prayer,",
          "Very nice thing to do when you go early and later. The crowd will mess up the experience. Earlier in the morning is really nice.",
          "We brought our three kids with us, ages 12, 8, and 4. It was one of our favorite sites in all of Japan. We arrived later in the day, which I liked because there were less crowds and made for some gorgeous lighting. It was getting quite dark, though, so with kids in tow, we only",
          "We took what I\u2019ll describe as the Robert Frost route (\u201ctwo roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I - I took the one less travelled by...\u201d): that is to say we took the forest hike that diverts from the main path and meanders around, and up the back of the mountain. Along the way",
          "This well known shrine offered all visitors something of value. For those who were energetic, you could walk the entire path, yet for those who were not as keen there were plenty of places to stop and admire the area or take a side-path through the gardens. The entrance area",
          "It\u2019s an very interesting place to see so many tori gates being stack up. One of the most Instagram worthy place in Kyoto. Although it can be crowded, u can wait for opportunities when there are less people to snap a few shots. There are also some interesting tori gates made of",
          "Has to be on everyone\u2019s list of things to do in Kyoto to be sure, but the concern is mostly about the enormous crowds that flock to this site. If you can wangle it, it is well worth visiting the Shrine after dark as the crowds are negligible and the venue is just as incredible",
          "We took two trains which puts you right out the front of the shrine. The area was beautiful and the torri gates were amazing to walk through. Very hard to get a picture as so many tourists but overall was a good experience. Perhaps maybe get there earlier in the morning (we",
          "One of the highlights of Kyoto; an amazing experience climbing the hill through an endless series of tori gates. The shrine is centuries old, but like most Shinto sites there is very little sign of pre-war activity. However, the layout is amazing, with superb views of Kyoto from",
          "Go early, so you won\u2019t get into the hundred of ridiculous teens taking pictures of themselves and forgetting to actually look at the shrine.",
          "Really enjoyed this other than the crowds. Very hard to get a nice picture without tourist groups in the background. Car park was free which was a bonus. Entry free too! And it\u2019s open 24 hours so my husband and dad went about 10pm and said it had an amazing atmosphere and no",
          "We went to Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shine very early in the morning as we want to avoid the crowd. It is a big shine located in Kyoto. Be prepared for a long walk to enjoy the view of the Tori gates and the scenery. Parent with baby stroller please note, there is some parts that",
          "Visited this shrine on arrival at kyoto. Beautiful shrine and immediately embraced the local feel. Crowds were huge but manageable . Would be far better to experience at another time which enabled a more spiritual feel. Lovely food stalls on the way down the street and back to",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit, but you need to make sure that you go really early in the morning before the crowds arrive. If you are into photography, this is a dream spot. The hike is fairly doable, but very doable at a slow pace.",
          "This is one of the main shrine of the area and most popular tourist spots. The main shrine sits on a hill and there is a long pathway to reach to it. The climb up is long and is surrounded by numerous Tori gates which is beautiful. But if you are unfit or cannot afford a steep",
          "Very beautiful and peaceful. Full of torii gates that will make you company all the way to the top. There are traditional shops (for souvenirs or drinks) and restaurants where you can truly experience the Japonese way, by sitting on a cushioned pad (after removing your shoes). I",
          "It is definitely worth to walk all the way from the station to the top of the entire temple site. Of course, there are crowds of people especially in the lower parts of the site, but the more you walk to the top, the less people you will encounter, and the more you will be able",
          "Interesting walk, plenty to see on the way to the top. There are alot of steps, so be warned you need to wear sensible foot ware. Take some wayer too. However, there are machines to get water ay a cost. It will be busy with many tourists, as you get further up it thons out and",
          "Very tired after the walk up to the top but totally worth the time. I recommend that you go up to the top because the view is glorious!",
          "Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine is a must see place in Kyoto. It has pathways formed by thousands of torii gates. If you go to Kyoto by train, just change to JR Nara Line Local and head for Inari station (price = 150 JPY). Exit Inari station and cross a road then your are in front",
          "The Fushimi Inari Taisha is extremely accessible; it is just right at the exit of the Inari station. The shrine has its characteristic path lined by many Torii gates, definitely photo-worthy!",
          "This place gets very crowded so it\u2019s better to go either very early in the morning (before sunrise) or later in the afternoon when the sun is beginning to go down.",
          "So, Kyoto is one awesome city! And the shrine is absolutely worth the visit...crowds or no crowds! We biked from out hotel so got there mid day so was crowded but took out time at the food vendors then started the trek through the gates...and interestingly the further you go",
          "When you are arriving there are multiple street food tents that tempt you into eating before going up. After walking for a bit, it is easy to take photos as most people there just for photos don\u2019t go far. Multiple place to stop along the way to rest and feel the peacefulness of",
          "It might be busy low down but climb and it soon quietens - we didn't heed the arrival early warning and it was busy but not crazy. Climb to the summit and you'll have lots of photo opportunities to yourself. Had street food at the bottom after which was yummy",
          "Tranquility, charm & spiritual. This is a must do!! Amazing photo opportunities. Can been busy in some parts but just be patient and you\u2019ll get a break for the perfect shot",
          "The gates extend all the way to the peak of the mountain and further down. It is a pity not to be able to climb up as we joined a day tour for Kyoto. If there is another opportunity to visit, will definitely do that.",
          "Having read the past reviews on Fushimi Inari Taisha, we had decided to visit it in the evening to avoid the crowd. We took the Keihan Line train to Fushimi Inari Station and then a short walk to the main entrance. It was about 5.30pm and past sunset when we arrived. We were",
          "We spent 1.5 hours up and down. Reached Inari station late so was crowded at the start of the trek. Crowd start to thin as you go further up so leave the photo shoot to later part of trek. After the trek, we had a yummy tempura meal at Temupra Oe restuarant. Short walk from",
          "Poorly designed, little english. Too crowded. No elevators/escalators or convenience shuttle. No thought given to handicap access!",
          "Was not too hard at all and enjoyed it with our tour group but it was very crowded so went at a slow pace which suited me anyway",
          "We went to Fushimi shrine during our Kyoto trip. It was very crowded even though it was weekdays. The Thousands Tori gates are the one of the most famous icons for Kyoto. These were appeared in the Hollywood movie \u201c Memories of Geisha \u201c. We only took the half trip as we have",
          "I look forward to seeing this every time I visit Kyoto. So wonderful and so iconic. Inspirational for many art.",
          "A beautiful long trail of torii, those nearer the entrance seems bigger than the ones in between the track. Walking in the direction of the torii are plain \"pillars\" of orangy red. If you turn around, you'll see inscriptions of sponsors on the other side of the torii pillars.",
          "To most, this climb is for an Instagrammable moment, but for others, this is a pilgrimage, and I think the tourists should recognise the local culture. They are not rude when they want to make the climb. You are when you blocked their way just to take a picture without anyone",
          "This certainly met my expectations, it was beautiful and we were surprised by how many gates there were. It is busy but this does not take away from the significance of the destination",
          "Nice place to walk all the way, people at the shops are very friendly, one could see orange wood all the way in thousands, nice experience.",
          "We arrived about 0800 and there were already so many people it was difficult to get good pictures. It was the busy fall colors seasons in Kyoto. Definitely recommend going early in the morning.",
          "We visited the Fushimi Inari Shrine overall it was a nice experience but there are lot of other tourists however and it got a bit over crowded. Don\u2019t get too close to some of the shrines as the caretakers don\u2019t like it. Which is fair enough. The architecture was pretty cool",
          "This Shrine is absolutely stunning! My only and biggest advice is - GO EARLY! I went the around 7:30 am and I did not have too many people, which made my hike and time at this spectacular place even more enjoyable. Don't make a mistake even if you go later and don't try to make",
          "Less people and very atmospheric if you have some peace and can walk leisurely. Just be aware that there is the odd trip hazard so a torch would be handy in a few poorly lit areas. Other than that a place to take your time in and perhaps walk up before sunset and enjoy the",
          "Spectacular and magnificent city to explore the ancient tradition of Japan from shrines through temples to food and culture of present day Japan",
          "Don't take pictures at the beginning! Everyone does and it's congested. Just hike up a bit and you can take the exact same picture. People and organizations pay money to have gates constructed here for good luck. Some look old but I think most aren't that old because they end up",
          "Second time to the shrine. The first time didn't leave a good impression on me as the whole place was crowded with tourists and I could barely move among the crowds, and the photos didn't turn out great. This time, when I reached there, it was coming to six in the evening. The",
          "It is a lot of walking, but worth it. It wasn't too busy when we arrived mid morning but got pretty crowded after lunch. The street food on the way in and out was great.",
          "I found out about this attraction in Vlogs and Vloggers often show just the first part where you enter the first Torii that leads to numerous more. What I found is that there is more to it and if you have a bit of time take the Mt Inari challenge and reach the summit. As soon",
          "Visited the Inari-taisha Shrine on a sunny day, only a few stops from Kyoto station. was very busy though, I went in the morning around 9am. As I was leaving about 11.30am, place was packed, so go early! Can be hard work but well worth it, take some drinks with you, although you",
          "One of those sights which you\u2019d have to do to tick off the \u2018have visited Kyoto\u201d list. Experience was underwhelming - certainly looks better in the photos whereas the reality is it seems a lot more jaded. Lots of people around, which probably makes it more difficult to",
          "Got there in the afternoon. It was awfully crowded. Did not walk through the whole route as there is no time indication at various split points and was not sure if we had enough time. Street food around the temple was interesting though many are overpriced.",
          "We got lost around the back of the mountain - we also lost the crowds! It was magical. Loosing the crowds was by far the best way to appriciate the beauty of the place, especially walking through the gates with autumn leaves falling. We too the path to the right. As the crowds",
          "As most reviewer stated, if you want to avoid crowd you have to be there really early. On our first try, we got there around 08:30 am and the place is already very crowded so instead of walking up we decided to just walk around the area surrounding fushimi and tried some of the",
          "I went on a Wednesday and it was still very busy. The tori gates were stunning as were the bamboo Forrest that surrounds the mountain.",
          "One of Kyoto's three unmissable experiences. Although fairly crowded, mainly with Japanese visitors, this did not really detract from the pleasure of the site. My overall impression was of a fun but respectful shrine. The main element is of course the long series of red arches.",
          "Visiting Fushimi Inari Shrine, you are transported in time to a magical place. Walking through the red gates, climbing up the hills, is a beautiful experience. Wear comfortable shoes!",
          "Well I thought since it was November there weren't going to be that many tourists but....I was wrong. You really have to go very early to avoid the crowds but even though it was really busy there are still breaks in the crowd for good pictures. Hike the whole thing and take in",
          "This is certainly the place to see the best Tori gates. You can get some great pictures as long as you are quick to avoid the people in view. Try taking an alternative route at certain places to achieve this. It is very much worth visiting to see the amount of colour set in",
          "impossible to take nice photos unless u head further up the hill as the crowd thins when going further upwards. there is graveyard. head there with a friend if you are worry.",
          "We went around 2pm and the place was packed with locals and tourists. Its quite a long walk up but there are exits along the way. On the way down there are many street food.",
          "This massive shrine has been around for more than 10 centuries! Numerous, massive orange gates along most of the trail, which takes about 2 hours if you want to do it all.",
          "Very nice place for a visit & walk up the mountain. Lots of scenic photo opportunities and chance to learn about the local culture. We went with a pair of University student volunteer guides from the Kyoto Good Samaritan Club. They were highly knowledgeable about the history of",
          "A bucket list item for me! Managed to complete and went all the way up this time round. The start of the climb was extremely crowded. Persevere and hike up and the crowd will not be as bad. Enjoyed it again! There are food stalls around.",
          "We took the very first train at 5am to beat the crowds at Fushimi Inari. We got there when it was still dark and I think it\u2019s the best way to do it. I climbed all the way up to the summit and the higher you climb, the less crowded it gets. The tori gates go all the way to top so",
          "Our family was here in Nov 2018. We went to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. Out of all three cities, Kyoto was my favorite and out of all temples and shrines, this was my favorite one. I agree with other reviewers, the place is ridiculously crowded but that\u2019s something we had to deal",
          "Husband and I are not buddhists so we came her just to have a look. We came on a Saturday mid morning and it was quite crowded. To go all the way up and down will take an hour or so. Quite many steps so for those with difficulty in walking may find a challenge to walk up.",
          "Such an amazing place to visit. Start of December was a bit quieter but still busy so would recommend going before 8am if you can. Look out to the sides of the main tracks as some more gates without the crowds worth a look!",
          "This is not my first trip to Fushimi Inari so this time we made sure to wake up very early to beat the crowds and do the long climb to the top! It's very exhausting, I don't recommend it if you have any joint pain or issues with walking. Many reviews here say its very busy and",
          "We have visited the place by late Nov. and happened to see the night scenes there. Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine was built to honor Inari, the Shinto God of rice. Apart from that at the entrance and nearby structures, visitors could walk uphill and view many other sub-shrines on",
          "It's about 10000 steps up and down (if my iPhone app was right). But it's worth every step and huffs and puffs along the way. I climbed early in the morning to avoid the crowd and late at night to seek quietude.",
          "One of the busy shrines in Kyoto. Was part of our day trip on Kyoto Bike tour. Having a guide to explain the background of the many thousands of 'gates' was interesting. There are tens of thousands some you can walk through others just to hang up. Its commercial atmosphere does",
          "This temple was very nice and unique. If you decide to do the whole loop, it may take you over 2 hours because there are lots of steps to go up. The orange torii is great to take pictures but it\u2019s always crowded! The food they sell prior to entering is amazing too.",
          "I'm glad I visited but I really wish I had come very early in the morning to avoid the heaving crowds. It's almost impossible to get a photo without thousands of people in it. You can walk all the way up the mountain or only do the lower part and then return another way to the",
          "Couldn't get over the sheer amount of Torii gates at this shrine, believe it or not there seemed to be more gates than tourists which is hard to comprehend. The climb was spoiled by regular showers and low cloud which spoiled the views over Kyoto. Easily reached by public",
          "Get there early...the shrine opens nice and early so take advantage. Once you get to 9am or after it gets busy. Ideally you want to walk through this astonishing shrine with as few people as possible. It is one of the most unique and stunning shrines.",
          "Whilst the start if this shrine is absolutely packed with tourists all trying to get a selfie with the first orange gste they see, if you manage to make your way past the crowd you start to climb Mt Inari and see some beautiful sights. It take maybe 3 hours in total to go up and",
          "We arrived at Inari Station in the late afternoon, headed to our nearby rental house on q quiet street nearby. We had researched exploring and experiencing Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine would be a highlight for us. It had been shared with us to go early or late afternoon or",
          "This is a big tourist destination, so my wife and I got up early. We arrived there about 7:30am and there were already about 100 people at the base of the walk. However, we ended up having almost the entirety of the walk up to the top by ourselves, which was amazing. On the",
          "Don't be afraid by the crowd when crossing the first torris, it gets way better after passing the first shrine. IMO the 45 mins of climbing to the summit aren't worth it... There is a small shrine at the top but no view. The best point of view is the one close to the big",
          "From the train to the exiting of the station to walking through the shrine it was shoulder to shoulder walking at a set pace. It would be lovely to see with only a few thousand people but it was so very crowded thou just had tho move with the crowd. For the energetic fit and",
          "Leave Kyoto early in the morning to have the mountain to yourself and other early birds! It is marvelous and quite a workout with a zen-like peacefulness. Do take the right side up the hill; the number of continuous steps is less than on the left side route. It took 90-120",
          "Came to Fushimi Inari in the morning. Around 8am and it's less crowded. Glad we came early, since the time we walk down from the peak people already gathered in main entrance. And almost impossible to take pictures with clear view without people passing by.",
          "This is by far one of the most famous visits in Kyoto. However, with that said, the crowds will be at Fushimi Inari. I would highly suggest setting your alarm very early at getting there by 8am. You can go up to the highest point for a view of Kyoto before the majority of",
          "The crowds thin out as the shrine winds its way up the hill. If you're looking (as I was) for the bit with two bits of the shrine corridor side by side. That is at the very beginning! So there's no need to toil on up the hill. That said, if you press on you get the bits of the",
          "Took the 8am from Kyoto station and two stops later we were there. Very few people at that time which made it easy to see the shrine and then walk up. Agree with the other reviewers ... the higher up, less people. By the time you get down all the food stalls to the right are",
          "Came here on a weekday a little after 7am (they are actually open 24 hours, but not sure how photography is after dark), sunrise was about 6:45am, so perfect timing. Practically got the whole place to ourselves and few die hard fans and early birders. You can take all the",
          "We came after dark but I thought it was beautiful. Enjoyed walking around visiting the shrine. Quiet, peaceful.",
          "Autumn is a crowded time of year to visit, but we had a great time, and the higher you climb, the more the crowds thin out. Walking through the torii is unforgettable.",
          "November foliage, history, culture and great tour guide made this trip memorable. Very crowded however, all worthwhile",
          "Of course this is a must do in Kyoto. My advice would be to read as much about the history behind it beforehand, as there's not much info given on site. Its a long walk to the top, and there's just a shrine (no view from the top! The only view is a view over Kyoto, somewhere",
          "Crowded with tourists. Climbed to the top of Mt Inari, which is a hour climb. As you climb higher, there will be less tourist and could get some good photos",
          "I was told before our trip that this was a \"must-see\" shrine. When we arrived, I was a little nervous because of the crowds. But this was the most memorable stop in Kyoto. The faomus trail of the Tori Gates is so much longer than you realize. At almost 75, my wife and I had a",
          "Amazing! You have to be at the opening to avoid the crowd. Waking up early in the morning is the best. Because walking with nobody is the most relaxing thing you could do. Take some water in order to avoid overprice bottle. It's a good walk, but nothing's difficult. Just go",
          "Once you climb high enough to lose the crowds, it's incredibly calm. A beautiful spot and Kyoto highlight.",
          "It is striking beautiful to look at it and it is also a real fun to walk inside. The orange colors, the writing and the green surrounding makes it a very pleasant place to visit.",
          "This is a great place for great pics. Unfortunately, it is super crowded because everyone is trying to take a selfie. I would go super early to avoid crowds.",
          "My daughter took me here and it was an enjoyable trip for me it was so crowded with tourists but we have no choice but to just go with the crowd anyways i was able to take some photos as souvenir of our trip. i think you better go there early right afer it opens or late in the",
          "The trek up to peak was doable and interesting with shrines, statues, red tori gates, snack shops, fountains, and most important, less crowd and more doable photo shoots with less photobomb.",
          "They\u2019re an iconic picture of not just Kyoto but also Japan. For me the place lived up to expectation and made for a nice walk / exercise up the hill and gates There must be around 1,000 gates and can give some amazing photos However it does get busy so worth while getting there",
          "The main attraction to me would be the city view from the lookout area mid way up. There is no view at all at the summit so don't waste your energy and time climbing all the way up.",
          "It's Ok, but not something you'll think you have to do again. Very crowded, as most of Kyoto seems to be at this time of year. The walk uphill through all the torii may be quite arduous for some, but the crowds do thin out the higher you go. Photo opportunities are limited",
          "What's not to be said about this? It's beautiful. I am so happy I went. We went during the evening around the sunset to night transition. There may seem like there are hordes of people, which they are at the beginning but trust me, if you keep ascending people are going to thin",
          "We went to the shrine in the late afternoon on a weekday and there was masses of people. The walk up the mountain through the Tori gates is free and is worth doing. The higher up the mountain the less people. Maybe early in the morning the crowds may be thinner. The shrine and",
          "I can say that i am satisfied with the outcome of my photos. Bcos the crowd there is crazy, i thot i couldnt have a decent alone selfie. Take note there might be some pushing & squeezing. I waited for awhile to take nice pics alone... But its worthwhile bcos the gates of the",
          "This temple is probably one of the most photographed area in Kyoto. We went here at 6:30 AM to avoid the crowd and it was worth it cause we were able to get decent shots without the tourists in the background. We did not anticipate that the hike will be difficult (for regular",
          "This photographic scence of thousands of Tori-gate is a must for everyone to visit when in Kyoto. Do not be upset try to take picture without somebody obstructed the view. The tunnel of Tori-gates is like an endless tunnel you can walk to the middle or at the end which less",
          "So when I went with my wife to the Inari shrine, I was ready for mystical, historical and out of this world. I think what it ended up being was just an experience I could not explain. The visual appeal was... unreal haha. The hike was a real workout (bring water). The food at",
          "So glad we made it! Enjoyed the walk up, surrounded by torri gates. Would suggest to go early to avoid the crowd.",
          "One of the must see shrines in Japan. Very crowded but worth the trip. Lots of stairs which tests your fitness!",
          "This was one of our favorite shrines but I am over 6 feet tall to you also have to watch you head. Be sure to visit.",
          "The gates are beautiful as they wind their way up the hill. Make sure you have comfortable shoes and if it\u2019s warm take lots of water. View of Kyoto at the half way point really provides an understanding of the size of Kyoto.",
          "Make sure you have time to explore. It is very crowded but people move in waves. Once you get past the first entrance it all moves smoothly. Stunning grounds and gardens. A very special place.",
          "Even though we visited in the dark and rain everything about this shrine looked impressive! It was lit up so we could still see all the buildings quite well . We walked part of the famous torii gate covered hiking trail but due to darkness and rain came back down again. Stopped",
          "Incredible - You have to visit there to appreciate it. Our guide was fantastic and got us there early in the morning with few others and we got great photos",
          "The Fushimi Inari Shrine is really, really crowded, so be sure to go early if possible before all the tour groups start coming in. The front of the shrine is really beautiful, and as long as you wait for a little while, you are sure to get a nice photo without too many people",
          "It is a long walk to the summit but worth the time and effort. The steep inclines are a challenge for younger children though. Great views along the way if you take a late afternoon walk and catch the sun setting.",
          "Have to see for yourself. Pictures are beautiful but do not do it justice. The historic value is undeniable.",
          "We visited in the very early AM and it was really great to see the orange Inari shrines without any obstructions/people (well, even early there were a few people but so few we just had to wait a bit for them to move on if we wanted to get a certain picture). It really is",
          "Very popular with tourists and locals alike, Fushimi Inari is a must visit when in Kyoto. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the long hike and made it only 1/4 way up but if you would like to do a hike in Japan I definitely recommend this place. There are spectacular views and it gets less",
          "A must see but absolutely get there by 7am to avoid the crowds. Have heard the night visits are also good. As a spiritual person, I visited as many shrines and temples during my visit to Japan. This shrine was by far my favorite, simply because of the architecture and orange",
          "This shrine is really crowed at the bottom but if you walk at least a few stages the crowd thins out and you can really appreciate the magnitude of it all.",
          "The guide books we read didn't really prepare us for the magnitude of this place. It takes at least 30 minutes to reach the top as you pass under hundreds, probably thousands, of tony gates. The shrine at the top is not that spectacular but it's the journey that impresses. There",
          "Really beautiful place. It is a good hiking trip in a famous shrine. On the way, you can see the panaromic view of Kyoto.",
          "This is a VERY LONG hike, half of which is UPHILL if you are to do it all! But it's worth it. It's beautiful and very unique! But our legs were feeling it for days afterwards! You need to be in good shape. Otherwise, you can still view a bit of it from the ground level and not",
          "Wonderful day walking area. Temple is extremely beautiful. Forest area in peaceful. Lots of fun shops near here. Just made for a very great memory.",
          "Extremely crowded at any given part of the day. We went pretty early, still the same. There are other more beautiful temples around.",
          "Like other shrines, it is a place for blessings. The symbol of 233 meters long red Torii tunnel & Fox messenger made it the world-famous reputation and welcome visitors with spectacular scenery and delicious street food in front of the entrance. It is the Must to visit!",
          "It's one of those must see place if you're in Kyoto. We got there at midday and there were so many people. There are many food and souvenir shops near the place. If you aim to take insta pictures, you can come early in the morning or keep going up the gates where there are not",
          "Well, this one of the big tourist place once you see you won't come back. The place is actually not bad; quite a number of things to see and even some pretty good food to try while on the way walking towards the shrine from the train station like - 500 yen grilled wagyu skewer",
          "We went there early and the place wasn\u2019t too crowded. More people at the start of the path. But as we walked higher and higher up, the crowd thinned out so we got to enjoy and appreciate the surrounding. There was a lot of steps to climb. Some were steep so good footwear is",
          "This is a highly recommended place to see in Kyoto. Just put one foot in front of the other and move through the Toriis in the forest to find yourself in nature.",
          "So many shrines in Japan. This one is visually attractive. Endless toris. And great photo ops. And decent access by trains. Super friendly and helpful Japanese helped us get there as we were time strapped. Our cruise ship Spectrum of the seas, docked as Osaka ans made the",
          "Many steps taken to walk up the \"summit\", go early in the morning if you really want a picture with totally no one behind you with these coloured beams.",
          "Exciting place to visit in Kyoto, truly makes you feel like you're in Japan! Extremely busy with fellow tourists though, which takes away from the experience somewhat. Lots of gates to walk through, really worth taking your time here, and also spending time at the street food",
          "Impressive shrine best visited early to avoid the crowds and get some decent photos of the gates. Its quite a hike up to the top but you get a good view of the city. Many of the gates are weathered and need maintenance but this doesn't detract from the impressive archways. We",
          "Thusday 14 November 2019. Price = This is free so can't complain Overall rating (4 out of 5) = I would reccomend if you are close by. It has plenty (and I mean plenty) of shrines everywhere. The walk isn't as 'casual' as it seems. The views at top oscar view of Kyoto as you",
          "Such a beautiful place to visit in Kyoto. We spent a fair bit of time here and no regret. It\u2019s very peaceful and beautiful. Make sure to wear comfy shoes as some parts get very hilly. A must visit if you are in Kyoto!",
          "A must go place in Kyoto!! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf Alot of tourist but worth it. Took train over and its convenient. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e",
          "Yes, it is insanely crowded (I did arrive at noonish) but worth it if you hike to the top. The beginning of the shrine, where all the Tori gates are very close together was packed so I didn't even bother trying to take a picture. as you keep hiking it becomes peaceful and",
          "This place is great. But bear in mind, you have A LOT of steps to climb - but it\u2019s worth it. We went at night and it\u2019s well lit enough to make the path but not too bright as to ruin the ambiance. Such a great last minute decision.",
          "Slightly out of town, but easily accessible by train... the station is opposite the entrance... this much lauded and very different attraction is more famous for its hundreds if not thousands of orange arches than it is for its temple. The 4 km walk up and round the hillside is",
          "I arrived at Fushimi Inari at about 7am and there was hardly anyone there. I had whole stretches of the walk to myself and plenty of time to take photos and soak it all in. It was very peaceful. I would recommend walking to the top as there are several beautiful shrines to see",
          "I don\u2019t need to say much more. Plenty of others have shared how good it is. It is packed and wheelchair access isn\u2019t really possible though.",
          "The place is much different from any other temples as the key attraction is the orange pillars and is one of a kind of attraction. Requires some fitness to complete the entire course. Come early, it gets really crowded",
          "This was an interesting place to visit and do read up about the importance of the Gates beforehand. The place was very full of tourists but managed well. Do eat at the stalls there as it is good food..",
          "I dont know how they built that shrine but it does show the japanese dedication and perseverence. The way is long to the top, so makr sure to have water with you, especially if you are with kids. At the top ill get to enjoy a nice view of Kyoto, and there are few souvenir",
          "The bright orange gate are so photogenic. You still can take photos without the crowd but waiting for some time till the group of crowd move on and a few mins in between. There are different paths and the place is huge - can easily spend 2 hrs. though the focus is on the gates,",
          "Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine is a beautiful seemingly never ending walk. We enjoyed going right to the top and seeing the whole lot. It was very crowded they perhaps would be better off charging a small admission to reduce crowds who would make progress slow with all the photos.",
          "Obviously this is on every \"must-see\" list when visiting Kyoto, and for good reason. The shrine is stunning. The torii gates are beautiful and surreal to walk through. And if you do a bit of hiking (40 minutes) up the path, you'll find a great view of Kyoto. The downside is -",
          "An interesting trip from Kyoto, short train, ferry and 20 minute walk. Beautiful place and very interesting, also a working shrine - locals go to worship and we also saw a shinto wedding when we were there and could take photos. Better when the tide is in and the place is",
          "These torri have to be seen to be believed. There is no need to follow the path all the way to the top of the mountain. A 30 minutes walk gives you a good idea and is also at the point where you can choose to go back down, via a different route. It\u2019s hot in Japan, so if you do",
          "Well worth a visit, although very crowded. We went late in the afternoon, and didn\u2019t turn around until after sunset. It was really pretty at night going down, and not so many people then.",
          "Very interesting and informative though incredibly crowded, especially at the base officers the hill where food stalls create a bottleneck. Certainly worth the effort, but would probably avoid in summer with higher temps and even bigger crowds.",
          "So my first day I decided this is where I want to go, it\u2019s my birthday I\u2019m intrigued and excited to get there. First off it\u2019s great walking in wish we had a tour guide that could translate everything for us but hey we have google translate so we were good. Now what all the",
          "This walk way is only a part of the temple complex and is very busy like all attractions in Kyoto. Visit in the morning it may be a little quieter. An easy place to visit on the local train only a couple of stops from the centre of Kyoto. I walk of approx. 15 minutes from the",
          "An interesting shrine dedicated to the god of rice and Saki. Easy to get to with subway from gioto where we stayed and there\u2019s a market on your way before entering the shrine itself . Here we had some nice street food - Kobe beef which was great . A lovely place to visit",
          "Wow, this is obviously a famous image of Japan and Kyoto, so we obviously wanted to visit here during our time traveling round Japan. It's a wonderful collection of Torii gates lining lovely winding paths as you climb. There is the odd local resident with a small shop selling",
          "too busy to enjoy and overall impression was not startling compared to other sites in the area which are better",
          "According to many other reviews and friends that have been before I was advised to visit in the offers due to the overwhelming crowds that it attracts. I'm happy I heeded the advice. I went at night at about 10pm and barely anyone was there. This made taking beautiful",
          "Im only giving it 4 stars because of the horrendous crowds. Stunning spot. Beautiful surrounding hillside which is nice to walk through and most tourists don't bother. Recommend you be there EARLY to avoid being crushed. Have to be very very patient to get a good pic. Free to",
          "Thronged by tourists and a hard long walk to the top. Its noisy and crowded, but well worth a visit when in Kyoto.",
          "Absolute must do attraction in Kyoto. Is doable with small children, however strollers may present a challenge. Beautiful sights!",
          "We took the train from Kyoto which drops you right outside the gates and is less than 10 minutes journey. If you have one the JR pass works for this trip. There is both the shrine and a temple here, we were lucky enough to see a Shinto priest ritual but they do not like you to",
          "Beautiful shrine and walk up the hill to get a fantastic view of Kyoto. We went in the morning and it was crowded, but get less so the further you walk up to the top. Highly recommend making the walk up to get the view of Kyoto. We were very fortunate that the weather was",
          "Take some time to walk all the way to the top which takes about 30 -45 minutes non-stop, and it is well worth it. The crowd thins out once passed mid-point and that\u2019s where you can slow down to take some nice photoes without other visitors. There are multiple shrines along",
          "This temple is best visited at night - get there by train. The train station stops right outside at Inari station on the Nara line. Walk through the impressive gates and make your way to the complex of many shrines. Then walk up the many, many stairs to the top - it takes long",
          "Definitely not to be missed! Can't decide if the color of the Torii gates is vermilion or cinnabar but they will certain command attention. I call it the \"Fox Shrine\" for short. Advice - don't just show up. Do your homework and read what is the purpose of the shrine. Wear a pair",
          "It's absolutely a fantastic place to visit. Try to be there early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when most of the people is gone. Besides this, even if it's quite crowded you will enjoy the experience.",
          "Worth a visit for sure. Very busy though but to be expected. Awesome food market just outside too and a lovely touch to be able to write our wishes and prayers and leave them there.",
          "Fantastic place to visit. Very busy at lower levels but if you can manage the walk to the top it becomes quite quiet and much better for photo taking.",
          "We went about an hour before sunset and it was still crowded. The roads are not extremely clearly marked and there are a lot of stops so for anyone aiming for sunset I recommend going at least 1.5h before. We made it to the summit when it was already dark and went back down too",
          "Fascinating shrine, never ending number of tori gates, beautiful! Totally worth going to the top, but you should know that it is quite a climb. Small 'cafes' along the way if you need a drink, ice cream or just a little rest. Amazing!",
          "Real fascinating place where you need to climb and walk a bit to get a good photo op . Amazing food to eat on the way Another must for tourists",
          "Close to the metro station. It takes about 3 hours to do the 5km Fushimi route. As you enter the 'venue' you pass by quite a few street market stalls. The route is quite well signed posted. The beginning of the trail is quite densely populated, but once you continue up the",
          "We got there fairly early in the morning but it was already quite busy, but you can move ahead fairly well. Some sections further up are two-way traffic, those parts are a bit difficult and can be annoying at busy times. We walked all the way to the top and it was really worth",
          "I absolutely loved my visit to this shrine. Before visiting, I had no idea how high up it extended to. Getting to the shrine from Gion is a simple 10 minute train ride. Before arriving, the streets leading up to the shrine are full of delicious foods and drinks. Once you get to",
          "Climbing the mountain through hundreds of red Tori gates - very inspiring, bring your best spiritual context. Not a Buddhist or a Shinto believer, still was filled with respect to the devotion of the believers who have created it. Climbing up is effortless, and rewarded with a",
          "It's an amazing place, very crowded and it takes some time until you can take a picture of the portals without anyother visitor in the middle. Nevertheless it\u00b4s worth to visit, a must seen in Kyoto. At the entrance you\u00b4ll find a lot of very convenient sourvenir shops",
          "It is hard to get a photo like this.It takes patience to wait for the crowds to clear. Easy to catch the metro to.",
          "AWESOME PLACE AND A MUST SEE On a trip to Kyoto. I would definitely recommend this for any stay in Kyoto. It\u2019s a good place to go walking and stretch your legs as well as see all the good sites and Shinto shrine\u2019s. I would recommend walking all the way up to the lake which is",
          "One of the more interesting and unique shrine... accessible by both Metro and trains... the train stations are a short distance away... be prepared to do some walking so do wear comfortable walking shoes.... Highly recommended!",
          "Impressive and nice place, but very very crowded with hundreds of other tourists. But worth a visit, you can read online about the history of the Shrine. Even if you don't walk up (with kids a bit long walk) it's a good experience.",
          "A \u2018must do\u2019 shrine in Kyoto. It was a short taxi ride from our hotel and it was very busy, even by 9.15. The complete loop takes about 90 minutes and I would say it is fairly challenging for a medium fitness person - it is pretty steep in parts and a lot of steps to the top",
          "Magnificent shrine with so many pillars and columns to take in. Had to be the most crowded place of all the sites we visited in Japan. I am very surprised that this is not a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Be prepared to climb a good amount of steps to see it all. It was fun to",
          "We heard from friends that FI is seriously crowded in the day. We also heard that it is accessible 24hrs a day (but you cannot go into the temple after 1700hrs). So we made our visit at 1900hrs. As it was October 2019, the sun sets at around 1745hrs. We thought we would be the",
          "As usual, expect long walks but be mesmerized by the beauty of thousands oranged torri gates. It will take you almost two hours if you will finish the trail. For those in a hurry or in a group tour, you may go back at 2nd or 3rd exit. This will them give you ample time to",
          "Be sure to take the trek to the top and see all of the thousand arches and sights along the way. Watch our for aggressive monkeys though !",
          "This is an incredibly beautiful and interesting shrine. As well as the famous Tori gates our guide spent time with us at the main Shrine and explaining about all the interesting customs and rituals that also go with attending this sacred place. Climb higher to avoid the tourists",
          "Great area, a must on your way in kyoto, just be awere of the up hill and long walk, But it Is worth it",
          "This shrine is big & beautiful!! Free to all, it is worth the time to take the steps to the top. There are plenty of stops along the way.",
          "One of the most important Shinto shrines in Japan. Located in Kyoto on the mountain of Inari-san. Once you finish seeing the shrine start your walk up the mountain were there's more than 5,000 tori gates donated by individuals and organizations. The hike up and back will take",
          "Worth visiting and walk through all the torii gates! It is open 24/7 so be there early (before 8am) to miss the crowd. From the main entrance start the trail on the right (as indicated). You can climb for an hour but don\u2019t have to do all of it as it is a bit the same after the",
          "Some places live up to the hype. This is a truly impressive shrine. If you like to take photos I highly recommend getting there as early as possible, before the tour groups overrun the place. The local train on the Keihan Line drops you five minutes from the grounds. Note that",
          "Unfortunately, my fellow visitors ruined this shrine for me. At its root, this shrine is extremely beautiful and unique, certainly worth a visit. The walking paths are very calming and impressive to see. There are several hikes, including a bamboo forest trek. Unfortunately, as",
          "There are lots of shopping stores, perfect picture taking places, historical places and friendly people around",
          "My lovely wife and I visited this Shinto Shrine to the goddess of rice. It is the most photographed location in Kyoto given it literally has 1001 orange torii gates up the mountainside through which you can walk. There are numerous stalls and food vendors around the entrance as",
          "I think when ppl come to kyoto, they should at least visit Fushimi Inari. From the kyoto station, we took the bus, buy a one day pass bus ticket \u00a5600... it\u2019s good to buy the one day pass if you want to go to lots of places in kyoto. One trip (by bus) usually charge \u00a5200 - \u00a5210 ~",
          "This was my first stop on my a Kyoto day trip from Tokyo. It was a great introduction! I spent nearly 3 hours here and time flew by. I almost made it to the top but the heat started to get to me. Definitely worth a few hours of your time. There were lots of \"street food\"",
          "Fushimi Inari Taisha is simply incredible to look at. With over 1,000 gates to go through, it is a very unique sight that you cannot find anywhere else. The shrine has neither an entrance fee nor opening hours, so you can go there whenever you please. I recommend going there",
          "Try to hike and reach up to the top of of mountain - it's worth it - and stay until dark so there would be less people and take good shots of the torii gates!",
          "a shrine packed with tourist. Not a place to find peace. Just love the color of the shrine. Very bold.",
          "Iconic temple, read about before going then enjoy the aesthetics. Go really early and avoid the stampede. Amazing temple and rich in history.",
          "Make sure you have your walking shoes on. It is like a nice stroll through a forest and even has momies. You can rest anytime. Only issue is lots of people taking photos does hold you up a bit. Go on your own not with a tour group.",
          "I\u2019ve been to Kyoto a few times, this was a first to this temple. It\u2019s a train ride south of town, easy to get too. The site itself is very nice. A bit of a hike getting up the hill to the shrine at top, but worth it. I would recommend against visiting if you\u2019re traveling",
          "This was absolutely one of my favorite things that I did while in Kyoto (all of Japan really). It is a gorgeous \"hike\" through the shrines. I would recommend that you go as early as possible (daylight needed) for this. It can get extremely busy with tourists, school field trips,",
          "Almost as many stairs as gates! We didn't make it to the top as we came later in the afternoon, after several hours of walking the city. This is a sight to see earlier in the day to take full advantage.",
          "We arrived just after 7 am and left before 11 am. There were still other people around, but when we got back down to the entrance around 10:45 am all the tourist buses and groups had arrived. We were thankful to be leaving! Wear comfortable shoes and take the hike all the way",
          "A great sight well worth a visit. The initial part is very crowded which spoils the spectacle a little bit, but if you continue up the climb you will be rewarded. Lots of people obviously turn back after about a third of the climb because after that it was nice & quiet, it was",
          "This shrine is unique with thousands of Torri red gates. A must visit when in Kyoto and it is not too far from city center. Definitely a IG spot but go early so that it is not too crowded. You don\u2019t have to go all the way to the TOP if u just want to take pic with the gates.",
          "The place was very crowded when we went (sunny Sunday morning). Definitely worthy to go to the top, as gets less crowded and you can really enjoy its special atmosphere.",
          "A literal sea of tourists. Large site spectacular vision of the layers and layers of orange gates. I would come very early to see.",
          "Read up first, hike to the top- great view and better photo ops, go early the crowds are never ending",
          "The shrine is Interesting because of the nature of the many arches and the fact that people donate money to bring them good fortune. It's a photogenic site and still possible to gets some good shots....especuallyt he further up you go ax most tourits dont make it too far up.",
          "Great for selfies and unlike all the other temples and shrines so worth a visit. No charge but lots of tourists so get up at 6am and go straight there.",
          "Beautiful setting. Took a path off of the main tour and saw a vast bamboo forest. Very interesting to see and cool to hear the popping sounds as they were burning the bamboo they cut down.",
          "I would recommend this if you either don't mind it being pretty busy. Also there is loads of commercialisation, tickets etc. but I suppose that is to be expected and to honest it is an amazing amount of shrine to be maintained! Allow time and energy to do the whole walk to",
          "Walking up the hill through the Torii gates is absolutely amazing with so many photo opportunities. And the further up you go the quieter the place gets so well worth the little bit of extra effort. There is also so much more to see apart from the Torii gates such as statues,",
          "This is one of the Bucket List when in Kyoto. The beautiful and unique Shrine with 1000 gates which is the location of Memoirs of Geisha film. If you wanna see Kyoto from the top of mountain, can try tracking and enjoy to hike throught Inari Gates till the top. The higher to",
          "I woke up at 7am and got there early (just after 8). It was a lovely walk up to the top with some good views. I would advise walking to the top of the mountain, it's not that high and isn't up stairs the whole way. Gets absolutely packed by 10am so, if you are visiting, get",
          "Fantastic place and very enjoyable walk in the forest/mountain side. Once you have got past the crowd it is a lovely enchanting place to be. The first half an hour is slow going and rather crowded but once you get to the loop which takes you up to the top then the crowd thinned",
          "We got up early on a grey day. We were at this amazing sacred place before the crowds turned. Had opportunity to walk long stretches without anyone else then us and the birds welcoming a new day. Get up early, walk slowly and reflect what an amazing place you are visiting. Don\u2019t",
          "Highly recommended. We walked the whole route, took about 2 hours with a slow pace. Take the photos up the hill, there is not as many tourists as in the beginning of the route.",
          "It is a very beautiful place . The hike was really good . It takes about nearly 30mins up but if you are tired , there are many stops that are either a cafe , restaurant or souvenir shops. All have bathrooms . Very well organize .\u270c\ufe0f Make sure and wear sensible shoes \ud83d\udc5f And walk",
          "..... this is a busy place and many families have small and large family shrines for generations and visit frequently",
          "Walk all the way to the top only to find that the viewpoint was closed. 29000 steps later - disappointing",
          "This was an amazing place to visit, but I was not prepared for how long and strenuous the hike all the way to the top was! However, it was well worth it, as the crowds die down significantly the higher you go. If you are planning to do the whole loop, allow yourself plenty of",
          "Didn't realise at the time that this was actually a 4 to 5km hike to the top of the mountain and that the orange gates go all the way to the top - pretty cool. Once you get passed the throngs of tourists at the bottom, the vast majoroty of whom don't go further than this, it's",
          "We decided to stop by this beautiful temple on our way to Nara. The train left us a few hundred meters from the entrance, there were loads of tourists stopping here even tho it was early morning. We began by viewing the map which showed a trail leading up threw the mountain,",
          "We didn't walk up the mountain but that's because we were hungover and lazy but we did walk up the first few 100 yards of the path and it was stunning. We also walked around the gardens at the base of the mountain which are lovely. I would suggest that you travel as early as",
          "Even it was a long walk but it\u2019s still a great place to visit. I will definitely come again and visit next time. I had a great time and I would recommend to do it.",
          "The orange shrines were mounted side by side up the mountain side. On the rear of the poles were the investers of each shrine with the message on the front. Kids loved running and seeing this attraction.",
          "It\u2019s a very unique and beautiful place but when we were there it was so crowded that it affected our experience in a negative manner.",
          "Get there early and although you may not be alone, there will be less tourists to spoil the walk. If that fails then keep climbing as the crowds do thin out once the walk start getting steeper. The gates are very impressive and offer lots of photo opportunities - better",
          "This place is beautiful, but overwhelmed with tourists and crowds. I would recommend going early or late - just after sunrise or before sunset to enjoy the serenity and inspiration that passing through the gates provides.",
          "This place was overwhelming!! It was beautiful but lots of people. A lot of rude tourists too. There were a lot of tourist there around 4:30pm. Pushing their way for the best pictures to post on Facebook or Instagram. We were told to get there at 7am to get the best pictures to",
          "Really crowded place, but it's really worth it the view and the photo spots! Plus so many street snacks around there\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb p.s: It's really suits with the place to having kimono there, you can find a good place to rent named, \"Nagomi\". You can easily find that on Google\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",
          "The succession of gates makes for a great photo IF you can wait long enough for just the right moment when there aren't a bunch of other tourists in your shot.",
          "I didn't think much of this looking at pictures. You gotta see for yourself. This place is beautiful. The further up you go the thinner the crowds and the better the experience and pictures. If I ever go back I'll definitely be walking all the way up to the top. If you want good",
          "We visited this shrine in a rain storm. Because of the rain we were just about the only visitors there. So happy we went even though it was raining. A beautiful place.",
          "Really amazing site to visit If you want to see the full site allow for a good hour for steep climb to the mountain top and another thirty minutes to walk down",
          "This is a major tourist site so gets very busy, but it is definitely worth a visit. Go early or late on the day and you will avoid the worst of the crowds.",
          "The walk through the shrine was awesome, however you need to go early because it gets super busy in the afternoon. We arrived around 8am and I definitely wouldn\u2019t go any later than that (I assume it would also be good later in the evening when the crowd dies down), around 11am",
          "If you are looking for a place to be one with nature, this could be your wonderland. It is easily accessible via subway. One thing to keep in mind is to go early before the crowds start coming in. The good news is that even if you come a little later in the day, the higher you",
          "The front entrance is flooded with tourists and food/souvenir vendors which at first were a bit intimidating, but after our just under 3-mile joke through the back trails to the summit of the mountain were a welcome reprieve. If you follow the crowd and main map you will find a",
          "It's was wonderful coming here and visiting Fushimi. My wife and I came here at night and so happy that we did. It's open 24/7 and it's free. It's an incredible work out to make to the top but so worth it.",
          "Great time as long as you are there EARLY! recommend arriving between 0530-0630 if you would like the entire time and route mostly to yourself to enjoy the peace,quiet, and be able to take your time. Plus its a long walk up so the heat of the day would make the hike unenjoyable.",
          "Part of the trail is so busy with people but you can easily go off the main track and it\u2019s lovely and peaceful walk with shrines as you go up the mountain.",
          "One of the most beautiful and interesting shrines Don\u2019t miss the view from the top If you come later you may avoid the crowds but it is a very busy place. Don\u2019t miss",
          "We wanted the famous photos and to enjoy the shrine without one big queue and crowd. We achieved this and loved every moment BUT we arrived at 6:45 am, we climbed up a little way and left just before 9am. At this point it was much much busier so I can only imagine how crowded it",

        "wiki": "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dz\u0435 Jugashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 \u2013 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who ruled the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. He served as the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131952) and premier of the Soviet Union (1941\u20131953). Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become the country's de facto dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism\u2013Leninism, while his own policies are known as Stalinism.\nBorn to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death. Under Stalin, \"socialism in one country\" became a central tenet of the party's dogma. Through the Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932\u201333. To eradicate accused \"enemies of the working class\", Stalin instituted the \"Great Purge\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, it signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German incursion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The Soviets annexed the Baltic states and helped establish Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global superpowers. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc which became known as the Cold War. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon in 1949. In these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign peaking in the doctors' plot. After Stalin's death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced him and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society.\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his totalitarian government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, deportations, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899 ===\nStalin was born in the Georgian town of Gori, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities. He was born on 18 December [O.S. 6 Dec] 1878, and baptised on 29 December. His parents, Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze, were ethnically Georgian, and Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language. He was their only child to survive past infancy and was nicknamed \"Soso\", a diminutive of \"Ioseb\".Besarion was a shoemaker and owned his own workshop; it was initially a financial success but later fell into decline, and the family found itself living in poverty. Besarion became an alcoholic and drunkenly beat his wife and son. Ekaterine and Stalin left the home by 1883 and began a wandering life, moving through nine different rented rooms over the next decade. In 1886, they moved into the house of a family friend, Father Christopher Charkviani. Ekaterine worked as a house cleaner and launderer and was determined to send her son to school. In September 1888, Stalin enrolled at the Gori Church School, a place secured by Charkviani. Although he got into many fights, Stalin excelled academically, displaying talent in painting and drama classes, writing his own poetry, and singing as a choirboy. Stalin faced several severe health problems; an 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial pock scars, and at age 12 he was seriously injured after being hit by a phaeton, which was the likely cause of a lifelong disability to his left arm.\n\nIn August 1894, Stalin enrolled in the Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis, enabled by a scholarship that allowed him to study at a reduced rate. He joined 600 trainee priests who boarded at the institution. Stalin was again academically successful and gained high grades. He continued writing poetry; five of his poems were published under the pseudonym of \"Soselo\" in Ilia Chavchavadze's newspaper Iveria ('Georgia'). Thematically, the poems dealt with topics like nature, land, and patriotism. According to Stalin's biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, they became \"minor Georgian classics\" and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years. As he grew older, Stalin lost interest in priestly studies, his grades dropped, and he was repeatedly confined to a cell for his rebellious behaviour. The seminary's journal noted that he declared himself an atheist, stalked out of prayers and refused to doff his hat to monks.Stalin joined a forbidden book club at the school; he was particularly influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done?. Another influential text was Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide, with Stalin adopting the nickname \"Koba\" from that of the book's bandit protagonist. He also read Capital, the 1867 book by German sociological theorist Karl Marx. Stalin devoted himself to Marx's socio-political theory, Marxism, which was then on the rise in Georgia, one of various forms of socialism opposed to the empire's governing tsarist authorities. At night, he attended secret workers' meetings and was introduced to Silibistro \"Silva\" Jibladze, the Marxist founder of Mesame Dasi (\"Third Group\"), a Georgian socialist group. Stalin left the seminary in April 1899 and never returned.\n\n\n=== Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party: 1899\u20131904 ===\nIn October 1899, Stalin began work as a meteorologist at a Tiflis observatory. He attracted a group of supporters through his classes in socialist theory and co-organised a secret workers' mass meeting for May Day 1900, at which he successfully encouraged many of the men to take strike action. By this point, the empire's secret police \u2014 the Okhrana \u2014 were aware of Stalin's activities within Tiflis' revolutionary milieu. They attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he escaped and went into hiding, living off the donations of friends and sympathisers. Remaining underground, he helped plan a demonstration for May Day 1901, in which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities. He continued to evade arrest by using aliases and sleeping in different apartments. In November 1901, he was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), a Marxist party founded in 1898.That month, Stalin travelled to the port city of Batumi. His militant rhetoric proved divisive among the city's Marxists, some of whom suspected that he might be an agent provocateur working for the government. He found employment at the Rothschild refinery storehouse, where he co-organised two workers' strikes. After several strike leaders were arrested, he co-organised a mass public demonstration which led to the storming of the prison; troops fired upon the demonstrators, 13 of whom were killed. Stalin organised another mass demonstration on the day of their funeral, before being arrested in April 1902. Held first in Batumi Prison and then Kutaisi Prison, in mid-1903 Stalin was sentenced to three years of exile in eastern Siberia.Stalin left Batumi in October, arriving at the small Siberian town of Novaya Uda in late November 1903. There, he lived in a two-room peasant's house, sleeping in the building's larder. He made two escape attempts; on the first he made it to Balagansk before returning due to frostbite. His second attempt, in January 1904, was successful and he made it to Tiflis. There, he co-edited a Georgian Marxist newspaper, Proletariatis Brdzola (\"Proletarian Struggle\"), with Philip Makharadze. He called for the Georgian Marxist movement to split from its Russian counterpart, resulting in several RSDLP members accusing him of holding views contrary to the ethos of Marxist internationalism and calling for his expulsion from the party; he soon recanted his opinions. During his exile, the RSDLP had split between Vladimir Lenin's \"Bolsheviks\" and Julius Martov's \"Mensheviks\". Stalin detested many of the Mensheviks in Georgia and aligned himself with the Bolsheviks. Although Stalin established a Bolshevik stronghold in the mining town of Chiatura, Bolshevism remained a minority force in the Menshevik-dominated Georgian revolutionary scene.\n\n\n=== Revolution of 1905 and its aftermath: 1905\u20131912 ===\n\nIn January 1905, government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg. Unrest soon spread across the Russian Empire in what came to be known as the Revolution of 1905. Georgia was particularly affected. Stalin was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris; at least 2,000 were killed. He publicly lambasted the \"pogroms against Jews and Armenians\" as being part of Tsar Nicholas II's attempts to \"buttress his despicable throne\". Stalin formed a Bolshevik Battle Squad which he used to try to keep Baku's warring ethnic factions apart; he also used the unrest as a cover for stealing printing equipment. Amid the growing violence throughout Georgia he formed further Battle Squads, with the Mensheviks doing the same. Stalin's squads disarmed local police and troops, raided government arsenals, and raised funds through protection rackets on large local businesses and mines. They launched attacks on the government's Cossack troops and pro-Tsarist Black Hundreds, co-ordinating some of their operations with the Menshevik militia.In November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Stalin as one of their delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Saint Petersburg. On arrival, he met Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, who informed him that the venue had been moved to Tampere in the Grand Duchy of Finland. At the conference Stalin met Lenin for the first time. Although Stalin held Lenin in deep respect, he was vocal in his disagreement with Lenin's view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the forthcoming election to the State Duma; Stalin saw the parliamentary process as a waste of time. In April 1906, Stalin attended the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm; this was his first trip outside the Russian Empire. At the conference, the RSDLP\u2014then led by its Menshevik majority\u2014agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery. Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this decision and later privately discussed how they could continue the robberies for the Bolshevik cause.Stalin married Kato Svanidze in a church ceremony at Senaki in July 1906. In March 1907 she bore a son, Yakov. By that year\u2014according to the historian Robert Service\u2014Stalin had established himself as \"Georgia's leading Bolshevik\". He attended the Fifth RSDLP Congress, held in London in May\u2013June 1907. After returning to Tiflis, Stalin organised the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank in June 1907. His gang ambushed the armed convoy in Yerevan Square with gunfire and home-made bombs. Around 40 people were killed, but all of his gang escaped alive.\nAfter the heist, Stalin settled in Baku with his wife and son. There, Mensheviks confronted Stalin about the robbery and voted to expel him from the RSDLP, but he took no notice of them.\n\nIn Baku, Stalin secured Bolshevik domination of the local RSDLP branch and edited two Bolshevik newspapers, Bakinsky Proletary and Gudok (\"Whistle\"). In August 1907, he attended the Seventh Congress of the Second International\u2014an international socialist organisation\u2014in Stuttgart, Germany. In November 1907, his wife died of typhus, and he left his son with her family in Tiflis. In Baku he had reassembled his gang, the Outfit, which continued to attack Black Hundreds and raised finances by running protection rackets, counterfeiting currency, and carrying out robberies. They also kidnapped the children of several wealthy figures to extract ransom money. In early 1908, he travelled to the Swiss city of Geneva to meet with Lenin and the prominent Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov, although the latter exasperated him.In March 1908, Stalin was arrested and interned in Bailov Prison in Baku. There he led the imprisoned Bolsheviks, organised discussion groups, and ordered the killing of suspected informants. He was eventually sentenced to two years exile in the village of Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province, arriving there in February 1909. In June, he escaped the village and made it to Kotlas disguised as a woman and from there to Saint Petersburg. In March 1910, he was arrested again and sent back to Solvychegodsk. There he had affairs with at least two women; his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, later gave birth to his second son, Konstantin. In June 1911, Stalin was given permission to move to Vologda, where he stayed for two months, having a relationship with Pelageya Onufrieva. He escaped to Saint Petersburg, where he was arrested in September 1911 and sentenced to a further three-year exile in Vologda.\n\n\n=== Rise to the Central Committee and editorship of Pravda: 1912\u20131917 ===\n\nIn January 1912, while Stalin was in exile, the first Bolshevik Central Committee had been elected at the Prague Conference. Shortly after the conference, Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee. Still in Vologda, Stalin agreed, remaining a Central Committee member for the rest of his life. Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support for the Bolsheviks from the empire's minority ethnicities. In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg, tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\"Star\") into a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\"). The new newspaper was launched in April 1912, although Stalin's role as editor was kept secret.In May 1912, he was arrested again and imprisoned in the Shpalerhy Prison, before being sentenced to three years exile in Siberia. In July, he arrived at the Siberian village of Narym, where he shared a room with fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov. After two months, Stalin and Sverdlov escaped back to Saint Petersburg.\nDuring a brief period back in Tiflis, Stalin and the Outfit planned the ambush of a mail coach, during which most of the group\u2014although not Stalin\u2014were apprehended by the authorities. Stalin returned to Saint Petersburg, where he continued editing and writing articles for Pravda.\n\nAfter the October 1912 Duma elections resulted in six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks being elected, Stalin wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions, for which he was criticised by Lenin. In late 1912, he twice crossed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire to visit Lenin in Krak\u00f3w, eventually bowing to Lenin's opposition to reunification with the Mensheviks. In January 1913, Stalin travelled to Vienna, where he conducted researches into the 'national question' of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Russian Empire's national and ethnic minorities. Lenin, who encouraged Stalin to write an article on the subject, wanted to attract these groups to the Bolshevik cause by offering them the right of secession from the Russian state, but at the same time hoped they would remain part of a future Bolshevik-governed Russia.Stalin's finished article was titled Marxism and the National Question, and first published in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye; Lenin was very happy with it. According to Montefiore, this was \"Stalin's most famous work\". The article was published under the pseudonym of \"K. Stalin\", a name he had been using since 1912. Derived from the Russian word for steel (stal), this has been translated as \"Man of Steel\"; Stalin may have intended it to imitate Lenin's pseudonym. Stalin retained this name for the rest of his life, possibly because it had been used on the article which established his reputation among the Bolsheviks.In February 1913, Stalin was arrested while back in Saint Petersburg. He was sentenced to four years exile in Turukhansk, a remote part of Siberia from which escape was particularly difficult. In August, he arrived in the village of Monastyrskoe, although after four weeks was relocated to the hamlet of Kostino. In March 1914, concerned over a potential escape attempt, the authorities moved Stalin to the hamlet of Kureika on the edge of the Arctic Circle. In the hamlet, Stalin had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygia, who was thirteen at the time and thus a year under the legal age of consent in Tsarist Russia. In or about December 1914, Pereprygia gave birth to Stalin's child, although the infant soon died. She gave birth to another of his children, Alexander, circa April 1917. In Kureika, Stalin lived closely with the indigenous Tunguses and Ostyak, and spent much of his time fishing.\n\n\n=== Russian Revolution: 1917 ===\nWhile Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 Stalin and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army, leaving for Monastyrskoe. They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for military service because of his crippled arm. Stalin was required to serve four more months on his exile, and he successfully requested that he serve it in nearby Achinsk. Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; uprisings broke out in Petrograd\u2014as Saint Petersburg had been renamed\u2014and Tsar Nicholas II abdicated to escape being violently overthrown. The Russian Empire became a de facto republic, headed by a Provisional Government dominated by liberals. In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd in March. There, Stalin and fellow Bolshevik Lev Kamenev assumed control of Pravda, and Stalin was appointed the Bolshevik representative to the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential council of the city's workers. In April, Stalin came third in the Bolshevik elections for the party's Central Committee; Lenin came first and Zinoviev came second. This reflected his senior standing in the party at the time.\n\nStalin helped organise the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by Bolshevik supporters. After the demonstration was suppressed, the Provisional Government initiated a crackdown on the Bolsheviks, raiding Pravda. During this raid, Stalin smuggled Lenin out of the newspaper's office and took charge of the Bolshevik leader's safety, moving him between Petrograd safe houses before smuggling him to Razliv. In Lenin's absence, Stalin continued editing Pravda and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the party's Sixth Congress, which was held covertly. Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling the Provisional Government in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Stalin and fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky both endorsed Lenin's plan of action, but it was initially opposed by Kamenev and other party members. Lenin returned to Petrograd and secured a majority in favour of a coup at a meeting of the Central Committee on 10 October.On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; Stalin salvaged some of this equipment to continue his activities. In the early hours of 25 October, Stalin joined Lenin in a Central Committee meeting in the Smolny Institute, from where the Bolshevik coup\u2014the October Revolution\u2014was directed. Bolshevik militia seized Petrograd's electric power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges. A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the Aurora, opened fire on the Winter Palace; the Provisional Government's assembled delegates surrendered and were arrested by the Bolsheviks. Although he had been tasked with briefing the Bolshevik delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets about the developing situation, Stalin's role in the coup had not been publicly visible. Trotsky and other later Bolshevik opponents of Stalin used this as evidence that his role in the coup had been insignificant, although later historians reject this. According to the historian Oleg Khlevniuk, Stalin \"filled an important role [in the October Revolution]... as a senior Bolshevik, member of the party's Central Committee, and editor of its main newspaper\"; the historian Stephen Kotkin similarly noted that Stalin had been \"in the thick of events\" in the build-up to the coup.\n\n\n== In Lenin's government ==\n\n\n=== Consolidating power: 1917\u20131918 ===\nOn 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\"). Stalin backed Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party, although they did form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Stalin became part of an informal foursome leading the government, alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov; of these, Sverdlov was regularly absent and died in March 1919. Stalin's office was based near to Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, and he and Trotsky were the only individuals allowed access to Lenin's study without an appointment. Although not so publicly well known as Lenin or Trotsky, Stalin's importance among the Bolsheviks grew. He co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, and along with Sverdlov, he chaired the sessions of the committee drafting a constitution for the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He strongly supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the subsequent Red Terror that it initiated; noting that state violence had proved an effective tool for capitalist powers, he believed that it would prove the same for the Soviet government. Unlike senior Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, Stalin never expressed concern about the rapid growth and expansion of the Cheka and Red Terror.\n\nHaving dropped his editorship of Pravda, Stalin was appointed the People's Commissar for Nationalities. He took Nadezhda Alliluyeva as his secretary and at some point married her, although the wedding date is unknown. In November 1917, he signed the Decree on Nationality, according ethnic and national minorities living in Russia the right of secession and self-determination. The decree's purpose was primarily strategic; the Bolsheviks wanted to gain favour among ethnic minorities but hoped that the latter would not actually desire independence. That month, he travelled to Helsinki to talk with the Finnish Social-Democrats, granting Finland's request for independence in December. His department allocated funds for the establishment of presses and schools in the languages of various ethnic minorities. Socialist revolutionaries accused Stalin's talk of federalism and national self-determination as a front for Sovnarkom's centralising and imperialist policies.Because of the ongoing First World War, in which Russia was fighting the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, Lenin's government relocated from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918. Stalin, Trotsky, Sverdlov, and Lenin lived at the Kremlin. Stalin supported Lenin's desire to sign an armistice with the Central Powers regardless of the cost in territory. Stalin thought it necessary because\u2014unlike Lenin\u2014he was unconvinced that Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. Lenin eventually convinced the other senior Bolsheviks of his viewpoint, resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. The treaty gave vast areas of land and resources to the Central Powers and angered many in Russia; the Left Socialist Revolutionaries withdrew from the coalition government over the issue. The governing RSDLP party was soon renamed, becoming the Russian Communist Party.\n\n\n=== Military Command: 1918\u20131921 ===\nAfter the Bolsheviks seized power, both right and left-wing armies rallied against them, generating the Russian Civil War. To secure access to the dwindling food supply, in May 1918 Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in southern Russia. Eager to prove himself as a commander, once there he took control of regional military operations. He befriended two military figures, Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who would form the nucleus of his military and political support base. Believing that victory was assured by numerical superiority, he sent large numbers of Red Army troops into battle against the region's anti-Bolshevik White armies, resulting in heavy losses; Lenin was concerned by this costly tactic. In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, sometimes without trial and\u2014in contravention of government orders\u2014purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, some of whom he also executed. His use of state violence and terror was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of; for instance, he ordered several villages to be torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.\n\nIn December 1918, Stalin was sent to Perm to lead an inquiry into how Alexander Kolchak's White forces had been able to decimate Red troops based there. He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Red Third Regiment defected, he ordered the public execution of captured defectors. In September he was returned to the Southern Front. During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, and a willingness to take on responsibility in conflict situations. At the same time, he disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted. He was reprimanded by Lenin at the 8th Party Congress for employing tactics which resulted in far too many deaths of Red Army soldiers. In November 1919, the government nonetheless awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his wartime service.The Bolsheviks won the Russian civil war by the end of 1919. By that time, Sovnarkom had turned its attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, to this end forming the Communist International in March 1919; Stalin attended its inaugural ceremony. Although Stalin did not share Lenin's belief that Europe's proletariat were on the verge of revolution, he acknowledged that as long as it stood alone, Soviet Russia remained vulnerable. In December 1918, he drew up decrees recognising Marxist-governed Soviet republics in Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia; during the civil war these Marxist governments were overthrown and the Baltic countries became fully independent of Russia, an act Stalin regarded as illegitimate. In February 1920, he was appointed to head the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate; that same month he was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.Following earlier clashes between Polish and Russian troops, the Polish\u2013Soviet War broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine and taking Kiev on 7 May. On 26 May, Stalin was moved to Ukraine, on the Southwest Front. The Red Army retook Kiev on 10 June and soon forced the Polish troops back into Poland. On 16 July, the Central Committee decided to take the war into Polish territory. Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russians against J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's Polish government. Stalin had cautioned against this; he believed that nationalism would lead the Polish working-classes to support their government's war effort. He also believed that the Red Army was ill-prepared to conduct an offensive war and that it would give White Armies a chance to resurface in Crimea, potentially reigniting the civil war. Stalin lost the argument, after which he accepted Lenin's decision and supported it. Along the Southwest Front, he became determined to conquer Lviv; in focusing on this goal he disobeyed orders in early August to transfer his troops to assist Mikhail Tukhachevsky's forces that were attacking Warsaw.In mid-August 1920, the Poles repulsed the Russian advance, and Stalin returned to Moscow to attend the Politburo meeting. In Moscow, Lenin and Trotsky blamed him for his behavior in the Polish\u2013Soviet war. Stalin felt humiliated and under-appreciated; on 17 August, he demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September. At the 9th Bolshevik Conference in late September, Trotsky accused Stalin of \"strategic mistakes\" in his handling of the war. Trotsky claimed that Stalin sabotaged the campaign by disobeying troop transfer orders. Lenin joined Trotsky in criticizing him, and nobody spoke on his behalf at the conference. Stalin felt disgraced and increased his antipathy toward Trotsky. The Polish-Soviet War ended on 18 March 1921, when a peace treaty was signed in Riga.\n\n\n=== Lenin's final years: 1921\u20131923 ===\n\nThe Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, while in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Russian state control. As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each national and ethnic group should have the right to self-expression, facilitated through \"autonomous republics\" within the Russian state in which they could oversee various regional affairs. In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russocentric by seeking to retain these nations within the Russian state.Stalin's native Caucasus posed a particular problem because of its highly multi-ethnic mix. Stalin opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani autonomous republics, arguing that these would likely oppress ethnic minorities within their respective territories; instead he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian affair. In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the southern Caucasus, there calling on Georgian Communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities in Georgia. On this trip, Stalin met with his son Yakov, and brought him back to Moscow; Nadya had given birth to another of Stalin's sons, Vasily, in March 1921.After the civil war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia, largely in opposition to Sovnarkom's food requisitioning project; as an antidote, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms: the New Economic Policy (NEP). There was also internal turmoil in the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for the abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this, and Stalin helped rally opposition to Trotsky's position. Stalin also agreed to supervise the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Central Committee Secretariat. At the 11th Party Congress in 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the party's new General Secretary. Although concerns were expressed that adopting this new post on top of his others would overstretch his workload and give him too much power, Stalin was appointed to the position. For Lenin, it was advantageous to have a key ally in this crucial post.\n\nIn May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralyzed. Residing at his Gorki dacha, Lenin's main connection to Sovnarkom was through Stalin, who was a regular visitor. Lenin twice asked Stalin to procure poison so that he could commit suicide, but Stalin never did so. Despite this comradeship, Lenin disliked what he referred to as Stalin's \"Asiatic\" manner and told his sister Maria that Stalin was \"not intelligent\". Lenin and Stalin argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that the Soviet state should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but Stalin supported Grigori Sokolnikov's view that doing so was impractical at that stage. Another disagreement came over the Georgian affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee's desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over Stalin's idea of a Transcaucasian one.They also disagreed on the nature of the Soviet state. Lenin called for establishment of a new federation named the \"Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia\", reflecting his desire for expansion across the two continents and insisted that the Russian state should join this union on equal terms with the other Soviet states. Stalin believed this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians, instead arguing that ethnic minorities would be content as \"autonomous republics\" within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Lenin accused Stalin of \"Great Russian chauvinism\"; Stalin accused Lenin of \"national liberalism\". A compromise was reached, in which the federation would be renamed the \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" (USSR). The USSR's formation was ratified in December 1922; although officially a federal system, all major decisions were taken by the governing Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow.Their differences also became personal; Lenin was particularly angered when Stalin was rude to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation. In the final years of his life, Krupskaya provided governing figures with Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin. These criticised Stalin's rude manners and excessive power, suggesting that Stalin should be removed from the position of general secretary. Some historians have questioned whether Lenin ever produced these, suggesting instead that they may have been written by Krupskaya, who had personal differences with Stalin; Stalin, however, never publicly voiced concerns about their authenticity.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Succeeding Lenin: 1924\u20131927 ===\n\nLenin died in January 1924. Stalin took charge of the funeral and was one of its pallbearers; against the wishes of Lenin's widow, the Politburo embalmed his corpse and placed it within a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. It was incorporated into a growing personality cult devoted to Lenin, with Petrograd being renamed \"Leningrad\" that year. To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the \"Foundations of Leninism\", later published in book form. During the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, \"Lenin's Testament\" was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations. Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him and he was retained in the position.As General Secretary, Stalin had had a free hand in making appointments to his own staff, implanting his loyalists throughout the party and administration. Favouring new Communist Party members, many from worker and peasant backgrounds, to the \"Old Bolsheviks\" who tended to be university educated, he ensured he had loyalists dispersed across the country's regions. Stalin had much contact with young party functionaries, and the desire for promotion led many provincial figures to seek to impress Stalin and gain his favour. Stalin also developed close relations with the trio at the heart of the secret police (first the Cheka and then its replacement, the State Political Directorate): Felix Dzerzhinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky. In his private life, he divided his time between his Kremlin apartment and a dacha at Zubalova; his wife gave birth to a daughter, Svetlana, in February 1926.In the wake of Lenin's death, various protagonists emerged in the struggle to become his successor: alongside Stalin was Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky. Stalin saw Trotsky\u2014whom he personally despised\u2014as the main obstacle to his dominance within the party. While Lenin had been ill Stalin had forged an anti-Trotsky alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev. Although Zinoviev was concerned about Stalin's growing authority, he rallied behind him at the 13th Congress as a counterweight to Trotsky, who now led a party faction known as the Left Opposition. The Left Opposition believed the NEP conceded too much to capitalism; Stalin was called a \"rightist\" for his support of the policy. Stalin built up a retinue of his supporters in the Central Committee, while the Left Opposition were gradually removed from their positions of influence. He was supported in this by Bukharin, who like Stalin believed that the Left Opposition's proposals would plunge the Soviet Union into instability.\n\nIn late 1924, Stalin moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev, removing their supporters from key positions. In 1925, the two moved into open opposition to Stalin and Bukharin. At the 14th Party Congress in December, they launched an attack against Stalin's faction, but it was unsuccessful. Stalin in turn accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism\u2014and thus instability\u2014into the party. In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky's supporters to form the United Opposition against Stalin; in October they agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted their views under Stalin's command. The factionalist arguments continued, with Stalin threatening to resign in October and then December 1926 and again in December 1927. In October 1927, Zinoviev and Trotsky were removed from the Central Committee; the latter was exiled to Kazakhstan and later deported from the country in 1929. Some of those United Opposition members who were repentant were later rehabilitated and returned to government.Stalin was now the party's supreme leader, although he was not the head of government, a task he entrusted to key ally Vyacheslav Molotov. Other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, with Stalin ensuring his allies ran the various state institutions. According to Montefiore, at this point \"Stalin was the leader of the oligarchs but he was far from a dictator\". His growing influence was reflected in the naming of various locations after him; in June 1924 the Ukrainian mining town of Yuzovka became Stalino, and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad on the order of Mikhail Kalinin and Avel Enukidze.In 1926, Stalin published On Questions of Leninism. Here, he argued for the concept of \"Socialism in One Country\", which he presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective. It nevertheless clashed with established Bolshevik views that socialism could not be established in one country but could only be achieved globally through the process of world revolution. In 1927, there was some argument in the party over Soviet policy regarding China. Stalin had called for the Communist Party of China, led by Chen Duxiu, to ally itself with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists, viewing a Communist-Kuomintang alliance as the best bulwark against Japanese imperial expansionism. Instead, the KMT repressed the Communists and a civil war broke out between the two sides.\n\n\n=== Dekulakisation, collectivisation, and industrialisation: 1927\u20131931 ===\n\n\n==== Economic policy ====\n\nThe Soviet Union lagged behind the industrial development of Western countries, and there had been a shortfall of grain; 1927 produced only 70% of grain produced in 1926. Stalin's government feared attack from Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Romania. Many Communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and its market-oriented approach; they had concerns about those who profited from the policy: affluent peasants known as \"kulaks\" and the small business owners or \"Nepmen\". At this point, Stalin turned against the NEP, putting him on a course to the \"left\" even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.In early 1928 Stalin travelled to Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding their grain and ordered that the kulaks be arrested and their grain confiscated, with Stalin bringing much of the area's grain back to Moscow with him in February. At his command, grain procurement squads surfaced across Western Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between these squads and the peasantry. Stalin announced that both kulaks and the \"middle peasants\" must be coerced into releasing their harvest. Bukharin and several other Central Committee members were angry that they had not been consulted about this measure, which they deemed rash. In January 1930, the Politburo approved the liquidation of the kulak class; accused kulaks were rounded up and exiled to other parts of the country or to concentration camps. Large numbers died during the journey. By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected by the de-kulakisation policy. According to Stalin biographer Dmitri Volkogonov, de-kulakisation was \"the first mass terror applied by Stalin in his own country\".\n\nIn 1929, the Politburo announced the mass collectivisation of agriculture, establishing both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms. Stalin barred kulaks from joining these collectives. Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face the fate of the kulaks; others joined amid intimidation and violence from party loyalists.\nBy 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%. Many of the collectivised peasants resented the loss of their private farmland, and productivity slumped. Famine broke out in many areas, with the Politburo frequently ordering the distribution of emergency food relief to these regions.Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation broke out in Ukraine, northern Caucasus, southern Russia, and central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were suppressed by the Red Army. Stalin responded to the uprisings with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials. Although he and Stalin had been close for many years, Bukharin expressed concerns about these policies; he regarded them as a return to Lenin's old \"war communism\" policy and believed that it would fail. By mid-1928 he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms. In November 1929 Stalin removed him from the Politburo.Officially, the Soviet Union had replaced the \"irrationality\" and \"wastefulness\" of a market economy with a planned economy organised along a long-term, precise, and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ad hoc commandments issued from the centre, often to make short-term targets. In 1928, the first five-year plan was launched, its main focus on boosting heavy industry; it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932. The USSR underwent a massive economic transformation. New mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, and work on the White Sea-Baltic Canal begun. Millions of peasants moved to the cities, although urban house building could not keep up with the demand. Large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.Many of the major construction projects, including the White Sea-Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour. The last elements of workers' control over industry were removed, with factory managers increasing their authority and receiving privileges and perks; Stalin defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx's argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism. To promote the intensification of labour, a series of medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced. Stalin's message was that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling amid the Wall Street crash. His speeches and articles reflected his utopian vision of the Soviet Union rising to unparalleled heights of human development, creating a \"new Soviet person\".\n\n\n==== Cultural and foreign policy ====\nIn 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed. He warned of a \"danger from the right\", including in the Communist Party itself. The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which several middle-class \"industrial specialists\" were convicted of sabotage. From 1929 to 1930, further show trials were held to intimidate opposition: these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial. Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian, he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state hierarchy and made the Russian language compulsory throughout schools and offices, albeit to be used in tandem with local languages in areas with non-Russian majorities. Nationalist sentiment among ethnic minorities was suppressed. Conservative social policies were promoted to enhance social discipline and boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units and motherhood, the re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions placed on abortion and divorce, and the abolition of the Zhenotdel women's department.\n\nStalin desired a \"cultural revolution\", entailing both the creation of a culture for the \"masses\" and the wider dissemination of previously elite culture. He oversaw the proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as the advancement of literacy and numeracy. Socialist realism was promoted throughout the arts, while Stalin personally wooed prominent writers, namely Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. He also expressed patronage for scientists whose research fitted within his preconceived interpretation of Marxism; he for instance endorsed the research of agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko despite the fact that it was rejected by the majority of Lysenko's scientific peers as pseudo-scientific. The government's anti-religious campaign was re-intensified, with increased funding given to the League of Militant Atheists. Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist clergy faced persecution. Many religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, destroyed in 1931 to make way for the (never completed) Palace of the Soviets. Religion retained an influence over much of the population; in the 1937 census, 57% of respondents identified as religious.Throughout the 1920s and beyond, Stalin placed a high priority on foreign policy. He personally met with a range of Western visitors, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, both of whom were impressed with him. Through the Communist International, Stalin's government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere in the world; initially, Stalin left the running of the organisation largely to Bukharin. At its 6th Congress in July 1928, Stalin informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came not from the right but from non-Marxist socialists and social democrats, whom he called \"social fascists\"; Stalin recognised that in many countries, the social democrats were the Marxist-Leninists' main rivals for working-class support. This preoccupation with opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin, who regarded the growth of fascism and the far right across Europe as a far greater threat. After Bukharin's departure, Stalin placed the Communist International under the administration of Dmitry Manuilsky and Osip Piatnitsky.Stalin faced problems in his family life. In 1929, his son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide; his failure earned Stalin's contempt. His relationship with Nadya was also strained amid their arguments and her mental health problems. In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which Stalin flirted with other women, Nadya shot herself.\nPublicly, the cause of death was given as appendicitis; Stalin also concealed the real cause of death from his children. Stalin's friends noted that he underwent a significant change following her suicide, becoming emotionally harder.\n\n\n=== Major crises: 1932\u20131939 ===\n\n\n==== Famine ====\n\nWithin the Soviet Union, there was widespread civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government. Social unrest, previously restricted largely to the countryside, was increasingly evident in urban areas, prompting Stalin to ease on some of his economic policies in 1932. In May 1932, he introduced a system of kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade their surplus produce. At the same time, penal sanctions became more severe; at Stalin's instigation, in August 1932 a decree was introduced wherein the theft of even a handful of grain could be a capital offense. The second five-year plan had its production quotas reduced from that of the first, with the main emphasis now being on improving living conditions. It therefore emphasised the expansion of housing space and the production of consumer goods. Like its predecessor, this plan was repeatedly amended to meet changing situations; there was for instance an increasing emphasis placed on armament production after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.The Soviet Union experienced a major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932\u201333; between five and seven million people died. Worst affected were Ukraine and the North Caucasus, although the famine also affected Kazakhstan and several Russian provinces. Historians have long debated whether Stalin's government had intended the famine to occur or not; there are no known documents in which Stalin or his government explicitly called for starvation to be used against the population. The 1931 and 1932 harvests had been poor ones because of weather conditions and had followed several years in which lower productivity had resulted in a gradual decline in output. Government policies\u2014including the focus on rapid industrialisation, the socialisation of livestock, and the emphasis on sown areas over crop rotation\u2014exacerbated the problem; the state had also failed to build reserve grain stocks for such an emergency. Stalin blamed the famine on hostile elements and sabotage within the peasantry; his government provided small amounts of food to famine-struck rural areas, although this was wholly insufficient to deal with the levels of starvation. The Soviet government believed that food supplies should be prioritized for the urban workforce; for Stalin, the fate of Soviet industrialisation was far more important than the lives of the peasantry. Grain exports, which were a major means of Soviet payment for machinery, declined heavily. Stalin would not acknowledge that his policies had contributed to the famine, the existence of which was kept secret from foreign observers.\n\n\n==== Ideological and foreign affairs ====\nIn 1935\u201336, Stalin oversaw a new constitution; its dramatic liberal features were designed as propaganda weapons, for all power rested in the hands of Stalin and his Politburo. He declared that \"socialism, which is the first phase of communism, has basically been achieved in this country\". In 1938, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), colloquially known as the Short Course, was released; Conquest later referred to it as the \"central text of Stalinism\". A number of authorised Stalin biographies were also published, although Stalin generally wanted to be portrayed as the embodiment of the Communist Party rather than have his life story explored. During the later 1930s, Stalin placed \"a few limits on the worship of his own greatness\". By 1938, Stalin's inner circle had gained a degree of stability, containing the personalities who would remain there until Stalin's death.\n\nSeeking improved international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union secured membership of the League of Nations, of which it had previously been excluded. Stalin initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter came to power in Germany. Stalin admired Hitler, particularly his manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives. Stalin nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the liberal democracies of Western Europe; in May 1935, the Soviets signed a treaty of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. At the Communist International's 7th Congress, held in July\u2013August 1935, the Soviet government encouraged Marxist-Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism. In turn, the anti-communist governments of Germany, Fascist Italy and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936.When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Soviets sent 648 aircraft and 407 tanks to the left-wing Republican faction; these were accompanied by 3,000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades set up by the Communist International. Stalin took a strong personal involvement in the Spanish situation. Germany and Italy backed the Nationalist faction, which was ultimately victorious in March 1939. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression pact the following August. Stalin aided the Chinese as the KMT and the Communists had suspended their civil war and formed the desired United Front.\n\n\n==== The Great Terror ====\n\nStalin often gave conflicting signals regarding state repression. In May 1933, he released from prison many convicted of minor offenses, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations. In September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments; that same month he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan. This mixed approach began to change in December 1934, after prominent party member Sergey Kirov was murdered. After the murder, Stalin became increasingly concerned by the threat of assassination, improved his personal security, and rarely went out in public. State repression intensified after Kirov's death; Stalin instigated this, reflecting his prioritisation of security above other considerations. Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could mete out rulings without involving the courts. In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counter-revolutionaries from urban areas; in early 1935, over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad. In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the NKVD.\nStalin orchestrated the arrest of many former opponents in the Communist Party as well as sitting members of the Central Committee: denounced as Western-backed mercenaries, many were imprisoned or exiled internally. The first Moscow Trial took place in August 1936; Kamenev and Zinoviev were among those accused of plotting assassinations, found guilty in a show trial, and executed. The second Moscow Show Trial took place in January 1937, and the third in March 1938, in which Bukharin and Rykov were accused of involvement in the alleged Trotskyite-Zinovievite terrorist plot and sentenced to death. By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from the Politburo, which was controlled entirely by Stalin.\nThere were mass expulsions from the party, with Stalin commanding foreign communist parties to also purge anti-Stalinist elements.During the 1930s and 1940s, NKVD groups assassinated defectors and opponents abroad; in August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, eliminating the last of Stalin's opponents among the former Party leadership. In May, this was followed by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges. These purges replaced most of the party's old guard with younger officials who did not remember a time before Stalin's leadership and who were regarded as more personally loyal to him. Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with Stalin to avoid becoming the victim of the purge. Such functionaries often carried out a greater number of arrests and executions than their quotas set by Stalin's central government.\n\nRepressions further intensified in December 1936 and remained at a high level until November 1938, a period known as the Great Purge. By the latter part of 1937, the purges had moved beyond the party and were affecting the wider population. In July 1937, the Politburo ordered a purge of \"anti-Soviet elements\" in society, targeting anti-Stalin Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex-White Army soldiers, and common criminals. That month, Stalin and Yezhov signed Order No. 00447, listing 268,950 people for arrest, of whom 75,950 were executed. He also initiated \"national operations\", the ethnic cleansing of non-Soviet ethnic groups\u2014among them Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese\u2014through internal or external exile. During these years, approximately 1.6 million people were arrested, 700,000 were shot, and an unknown number died under NKVD torture.Stalin initiated all key decisions during the Terror, personally directing many of its operations and taking an interest in their implementation. His motives in doing so have been much debated by historians. His personal writings from the period were \u2014 according to Khlevniuk \u2014 \"unusually convoluted and incoherent\", filled with claims about enemies encircling him. He was particularly concerned at the success that right-wing forces had in overthrowing the leftist Spanish government, fearing a domestic fifth column in the event of future war with Japan and Germany. The Great Terror ended when Yezhov was removed as the head of the NKVD, to be replaced by Lavrentiy Beria, a man totally devoted to Stalin. Yezhov was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940. The Terror damaged the Soviet Union's reputation abroad, particularly among sympathetic leftists. As it wound down, Stalin sought to deflect responsibility from himself, blaming its \"excesses\" and \"violations of law\" on Yezhov. According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research shows that the motivation behind the purges was not Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an excessive fear of counterrevolution.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Pact with Nazi Germany: 1939\u20131941 ===\nAs a Marxist\u2013Leninist, Stalin expected an inevitable conflict between competing capitalist powers; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Stalin recognised a war was looming. He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and Britain would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe. Militarily, the Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s. Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained. Between 1940 and 1941 he also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war broke out.\n\nAs Britain and France seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, Stalin saw a better deal with the Germans. On 3 May 1939, Stalin replaced his western-oriented foreign minister Maxim Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov. In May 1939, Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between the two powers. Stalin saw this as an opportunity both for territorial expansion and temporary peace with Germany. In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Germany, a non-aggression pact negotiated by Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. A week later, Germany invaded Poland, sparking the UK and France to declare war on Germany. On 17 September, the Red Army entered eastern Poland, officially to restore order amid the collapse of the Polish state. On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of their newly conquered territories; Germany gained the linguistically Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province while the Soviets gained Lithuania. A German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after, in Stalin's presence. The two states continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.The Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Finland, but the Finnish government refused. The Soviets invaded Finland in November 1939, yet despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay. International opinion backed Finland, with the Soviets being expelled from the League of Nations. Embarrassed by their inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an interim peace treaty, in which they received territorial concessions from Finland. In June 1940, the Red Army occupied the Baltic states, which were forcibly merged into the Soviet Union in August; they also invaded and annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of Romania. The Soviets sought to forestall dissent in these new East European territories with mass repressions. One of the most noted instances was the Katyn massacre of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed.The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took Stalin by surprise. He increasingly focused on appeasement with the Germans to delay any conflict with them. After the Tripartite Pact was signed by Axis Powers Germany, Japan, and Italy in October 1940, Stalin proposed that the USSR also join the Axis alliance. To demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, in April 1941 the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan. Although de facto head of government for a decade and a half, Stalin concluded that relations with Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that he needed to deal with the problem as de jure head of government as well: on 6 May, Stalin replaced Molotov as Premier of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== German invasion: 1941\u20131942 ===\n\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front. Although intelligence agencies had repeatedly warned him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise. He formed a State Defense Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander, as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff. The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days. The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory; soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities. By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale. The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.Going against the advice of Zhukov and other generals, Stalin emphasised attack over defence. In June 1941, he ordered a scorched earth policy of destroying infrastructure and food supplies before the Germans could seize them, also commanding the NKVD to kill around 100,000 political prisoners in areas the Wehrmacht approached. He purged the military command; several high-ranking figures were demoted or reassigned and others were arrested and executed. With Order No. 270, Stalin commanded soldiers risking capture to fight to the death describing the captured as traitors; among those taken as a prisoner of war by the Germans was Stalin's son Yakov, who died in their custody. Stalin issued Order No. 227 in July 1942, which directed that those retreating unauthorised would be placed in \"penal battalions\" used as cannon fodder on the front lines. Amid the fighting, both the German and Soviet armies disregarded the law of war set forth in the Geneva Conventions; the Soviets heavily publicised Nazi massacres of communists, Jews, and Romani. Stalin exploited Nazi anti-Semitism, and in April 1942 he sponsored the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) to garner Jewish and foreign support for the Soviet war effort.\n\nThe Soviets allied with the United Kingdom and United States; although the U.S. joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942. Responding to the invasion, the Soviets intensified their industrial enterprises in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on production for the military. They achieved high levels of industrial productivity, outstripping that of Germany. During the war, Stalin was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church, allowing it to resume some of its activities and meeting with Patriarch Sergius in September 1943. He also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich to disperse their work more widely. The Internationale was dropped as the country's national anthem, to be replaced with a more patriotic song. The government increasingly promoted Pan-Slavist sentiment, while encouraging increased criticism of cosmopolitanism, particularly the idea of \"rootless cosmopolitanism\", an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews. Comintern was dissolved in 1943, and Stalin encouraged foreign Marxist\u2013Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism to broaden their domestic appeal.In April 1942, Stalin overrode Stavka by ordering the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine. This attack proved unsuccessful. That year, Hitler shifted his primary goal from an overall victory on the Eastern Front, to the goal of securing the oil fields in the southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort. While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, Stalin considered this to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow. In June 1942, the German Army began a major offensive in Southern Russia, threatening Stalingrad; Stalin ordered the Red Army to hold the city at all costs. This resulted in the protracted Battle of Stalingrad. In December 1942, he placed Konstantin Rokossovski in charge of holding the city. In February 1943, the German troops attacking Stalingrad surrendered. The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war; in commemoration, Stalin declared himself Marshal of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Soviet counter-attack: 1942\u20131945 ===\n\nBy November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the important German strategic southern campaign and, although there were 2.5 million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front. Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941 to 1942. Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from German invasion and aerial assault.In Allied countries, Stalin was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war. In 1941, the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert to celebrate his birthday, and in 1942, Time magazine named him \"Man of the Year\". When Stalin learned that people in Western countries affectionately called him \"Uncle Joe\" he was initially offended, regarding it as undignified. There remained mutual suspicions between Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were together known as the \"Big Three\". Churchill flew to Moscow to visit Stalin in August 1942 and again in October 1944. Stalin scarcely left Moscow throughout the war, with Roosevelt and Churchill frustrated with his reluctance to travel to meet them.In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a location of Stalin's choosing. There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war dismantling of the British Empire. At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin's demand that the German city of K\u00f6nigsberg be declared Soviet territory. Stalin was impatient for the UK and U.S. to open up a Western Front to take the pressure off of the East; they eventually did so in mid-1944. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill opposed. Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.\n\nIn 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany, including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in the Byelorussian SSR against the German Army Group Centre. In 1944 the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states (with the execption of the Ostland), which were then re-annexed into the Soviet Union. As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and Crimea, various ethnic groups living in the region\u2014the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars\u2014were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of collective responsibility as a basis, Stalin's government abolished their autonomous republics and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their populations to Central Asia and Siberia. Over one million people were deported as a result of the policy.In February 1945, the three leaders met at the Yalta Conference. Roosevelt and Churchill conceded to Stalin's demand that Germany pay the Soviet Union 20 billion dollars in reparations, and that his country be permitted to annex Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in exchange for entering the war against Japan. An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements. Privately, Stalin sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence. The Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising, with Stalin believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with his aspirations to dominate Poland through a future Marxist government. Although concealing his desires from the other Allied leaders, Stalin placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin first, believing that this would enable him to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. Churchill was concerned that this was the case and unsuccessfully tried to convince the U.S. that the Western Allies should pursue the same goal.\n\n\n=== Victory: 1945 ===\n\nIn April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler committed suicide, and Germany surrendered in May. Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers. As the Red Army had conquered German territory, they discovered the extermination camps that the Nazi administration had run. Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe. Stalin refused to punish the offenders. After receiving a complaint about this from Yugoslav communist Milovan Djilas, Stalin asked how after experiencing the traumas of war a soldier could \"react normally? And what is so awful in his having fun with a woman, after such horrors?\"With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East. Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia. On 8 August, in between the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and defeated the Kwantung Army. These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war's end. Soviet forces continued to expand until they occupied all their territorial concessions, but the U.S. rebuffed Stalin's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan.Stalin attended the Potsdam Conference in July\u2013August 1945, alongside his new British and U.S. counterparts, Prime Minister Clement Attlee and President Harry Truman. At the conference, Stalin repeated previous promises to Churchill that he would refrain from a \"Sovietization\" of Eastern Europe. Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers. He also pushed for \"war booty\", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations. Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin itself\u2014located within the Soviet area\u2014also subdivided thusly.\n\n\n== Post-war era ==\n\n\n=== Post-war reconstruction and famine: 1945\u20131947 ===\nAfter the war, Stalin was\u2014according to Service\u2014at the \"apex of his career\". Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism. His armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe.\nIn June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimus, and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square. At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed the Russians over other Soviet nationalities. In 1946, the state published Stalin's Collected Works. In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which eulogised him to a greater extent than its predecessor. He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes.\n\nDespite his strengthened international position, Stalin was cautious about internal dissent and desire for change among the population. He was also concerned about his returning armies, who had been exposed to a wide range of consumer goods in Germany, much of which they had looted and brought back with them. In this he recalled the 1825 Decembrist Revolt by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the Napoleonic Wars. He ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through \"filtration\" camps as they arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if they were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps. In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programs were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949. The Gulag system of labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three percent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8 million in \"special settlements\" in isolated areas and another 2.5 million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war. It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed. The NKVD recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned. In the war's aftermath, some of Stalin's associates suggested modifications to government policy. Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. Stalin allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war. Academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom than they had prior to 1941. Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic regeneration, in December 1947 Stalin's government devalued the ruble and abolished the ration-book system. Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but reinstalled in 1950.Stalin's health was deteriorating, and heart problems forced a two-month vacation in the latter part of 1945.\nHe grew increasingly concerned that senior political and military figures might try to oust him; he prevented any of them from becoming powerful enough to rival him and had their apartments bugged with listening devices. He demoted Molotov, and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions. In 1949, he brought Nikita Khrushchev from Ukraine to Moscow, appointing him a Central Committee secretary and the head of the city's party branch. In the Leningrad Affair, the city's leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities, and the USSR experienced a major famine from 1946 to 1947. Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, it was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the state's decision to build up stocks and export food internationally rather than distributing it to famine hit areas. Current estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result. While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north. Much of this was constructed by prison labour.\n\n\n=== Cold War policy: 1947\u20131950 ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S. and USSR as the dominant world powers. Tensions among these former Allies grew, resulting in the Cold War. Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S. governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely. He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb. Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, saying in 1949 that \"atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.\" He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon. In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan. Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953.The US began pushing its interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America. It launched the Marshall Plan in June 1947, with which it sought to undermine Soviet hegemony in eastern Europe. The US also offered financial assistance as part of the Marshall Plan on the condition that they opened their markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree.\nThe Allies demanded that Stalin withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran. He initially refused, leading to an international crisis in 1946, but one year later Stalin finally relented and moved the Soviet troops out.\nStalin also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya\u2014recently liberated from Italian occupation\u2014to become a Soviet protectorate. He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco to take part in negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the Soviets have a place on the Security Council. In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries. Within Western countries, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the \"most evil dictator alive\" and compared to Hitler.In 1948, Stalin edited and rewrote sections of Falsifiers of History, published as a series of Pravda articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with Germany, it focused on blaming Western powers for the war. He erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the war was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat. In 1949, celebrations took place to mark Stalin's seventieth birthday (albeit not the correct year) at which Stalin attended an event in the Bolshoi Theatre alongside Marxist\u2013Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.\n\n\n==== Eastern Bloc ====\n\nAfter the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia. Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments across Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries. In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states.\nHe was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis. He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic. Aware that these countries had been pushed toward socialism through invasion rather than by proletarian revolution, Stalin referred to them not as \"dictatorships of the proletariat\" but as \"people's democracies\", suggesting that in these countries there was a pro-socialist alliance combining the proletariat, peasantry, and lower middle-class.Churchill observed that an \"Iron Curtain\" had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west. In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders was held in Szklarska Por\u0119ba, Poland, from which was formed Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy. Stalin did not personally attend the meeting, sending Zhdanov in his place. Various East European communists also visited Stalin in Moscow. There, he offered advice on their ideas; for instance he cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania. Stalin had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito due to the latter's continued calls for Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing Greek Civil War. In March 1948, Stalin launched an anti-Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine. At the second Cominform conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Tito's government, accusing them of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism. Stalin ordered several assassination attempts on Tito's life and contemplated invading Yugoslavia.Stalin suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral. When the US and UK remained opposed to this, Stalin sought to force their hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948. He gambled that the others would not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Stalin relented and ended the blockade. In September 1949 the Western powers transformed Western Germany into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed East Germany into the German Democratic Republic in October. In accordance with their earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections. In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers' Party, and vote rigging was used to ensure that it secured office. The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged, with the Hungarian Working People's Party taking control. In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946. Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania. Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry. It was aimed for economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc.\n\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn October 1949, Mao took power in China. With this accomplished, Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass. Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT. In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin. Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty between the two countries. Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance from China; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western government in the south. North Korean leader Kim Il-sung visited Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south and although Stalin was initially reluctant to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950. The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading the south in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul. Both Stalin and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue. The U.S. went to the UN Security Council\u2014which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government\u2014and secured military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back. Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., convincing the Chinese to aid the North.The Soviet Union was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948. When the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet her. He was further angered by Israel's growing alliance with the U.S. After Stalin fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. In November 1948, he abolished the JAC, and show trials took place for some of its members. The Soviet press engaged in attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and \"rootless cosmopolitanism\", with growing levels of anti-Semitism being expressed across Soviet society. Stalin's increasing tolerance of anti-Semitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that anti-Semitism had proved a useful mobilising tool for Hitler and that he could do the same; he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a \"counter-revolutionary\" nation whose members were loyal to the U.S. There were rumours, although they have never been substantiated, that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan, eastern Siberia.\n\n\n=== Final years: 1950\u20131953 ===\nIn his later years, Stalin was in poor health. He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months vacationing at his Abkhazian dacha. Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health. In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the Doctors' Plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish. He instructed the arrested doctors to be tortured to ensure confession. In November, the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial took place in Czechoslovakia as 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert Eastern Bloc governments. That same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine. In 1951, he initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian branch of the Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.From 1946 until his death, Stalin only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes. The amount of written material that he produced also declined. In 1950, Stalin issued the article \"Marxism and Problems of Linguistics\", which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood.\nIn 1952, Stalin's last book, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country after his death. In October 1952, Stalin gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum. There, he emphasised what he regarded as leadership qualities necessary in the future and highlighted the weaknesses of various potential successors, particularly Molotov and Mikoyan. In 1952, he also eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version which he called the Presidium.\n\n\n==== Death, funeral and aftermath ====\n\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Volynskoe dacha. He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days. He was hand-fed using a spoon, given various medicines and injections, and leeches were applied to him. Svetlana and Vasily were called to the dacha on 2 March; the latter was drunk and angrily shouted at the doctors, resulting in him being sent home. Stalin died on 5 March 1953. According to Svetlana, it had been \"a difficult and terrible death\". An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral hemorrhage and that he also suffered from severe damage to his cerebral arteries due to atherosclerosis. It is possible that Stalin was murdered. Beria has been suspected of murder, although no firm evidence has ever appeared.Stalin's death was announced on 6 March. The body was embalmed, and then placed on display in Moscow's House of Unions for three days. Crowds were such that a crush killed about 100 people. The funeral involved the body being laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square on 9 March; hundreds of thousands attended. That month featured a surge in arrests for \"anti-Soviet agitation\" as those celebrating Stalin's death came to police attention. The Chinese government instituted a period of official mourning for Stalin's death.Stalin left no anointed successor nor a framework within which a transfer of power could take place. The Central Committee met on the day of his death, with Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerging as the party's key figures. The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member attaining autocratic domination again. The collective leadership included the following eight senior members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union listed according to the order of precedence presented formally on 5 March 1953: Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Anastas Mikoyan. Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented. Economic reform scaled back the mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production. The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S., pursuing a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953. The doctors who had been imprisoned were released and the anti-Semitic purges ceased. A mass amnesty for those imprisoned for non-political crimes was issued, halving the country's inmate population, while the state security and Gulag systems were reformed, with torture being banned in April 1953.\n\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\nStalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of fifteen, and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life; according to Kotkin, Stalin held \"zealous Marxist convictions\", while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a \"quasi-religious\" value for Stalin. Although he never became a Georgian nationalist, during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook. The historian Alfred J. Rieber noted that he had been raised in \"a society where rebellion was deeply rooted in folklore and popular rituals\". Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that \"there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter\". Volkogonov believed that Stalin's Marxism was shaped by his \"dogmatic turn of mind\", suggesting that this had been instilled in the Soviet leader during his education in religious institutions. According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's \"few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism\". Some of these derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment; Stalin would often turn to ideology post hoc to justify his decisions. Stalin referred to himself as a praktik, meaning that he was more of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.As a Marxist and an extreme anti-capitalist, Stalin believed in an inevitable \"class war\" between the world's proletariat and bourgeoise. He believed that the working classes would prove successful in this struggle and would establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state. He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures against foreign and domestic \"enemies\" to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes, and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism. As a propaganda tool, the shaming of \"enemies\" explained all inadequate economic and political outcomes, the hardships endured by the populace, and military failures. The new state would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the wastefulness of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system. According to Sandle, Stalin was \"committed to the creation of a society that was industrialised, collectivised, centrally planned and technologically advanced.\"Stalin adhered to the Leninist variant of Marxism. In his book, Foundations of Leninism, he stated that \"Leninism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution\". He claimed to be a loyal Leninist, although was\u2014according to Service\u2014\"not a blindly obedient Leninist\". Stalin respected Lenin, but not uncritically, and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong. During the period of his revolutionary activity, Stalin regarded some of Lenin's views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoiled \u00e9migr\u00e9, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself. After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences. Whereas Lenin believed that all countries across Europe and Asia would readily unite as a single state following proletariat revolution, Stalin argued that national pride would prevent this, and that different socialist states would have to be formed; in his view, a country like Germany would not readily submit to being part of a Russian-dominated federal state. Stalin biographer Oleg Khlevniuk nevertheless believed that the pair developed a \"strong bond\" over the years, while Kotkin suggested that Stalin's friendship with Lenin was \"the single most important relationship in Stalin's life\". After Lenin's death, Stalin relied heavily on Lenin's writings\u2014far more so than those of Marx and Engels\u2014to guide him in the affairs of state. Stalin adopted the Leninist view on the need for a revolutionary vanguard who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them. Leading this vanguard, he believed that the Soviet peoples needed a strong, central figure\u2014akin to a Tsar\u2014whom they could rally around. In his words, \"the people need a Tsar, whom they can worship and for whom they can live and work\". He read about, and admired, two Tsars in particular: Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. In the personality cult constructed around him, he was known as the vozhd, an equivalent to the Italian duce and German fuhrer.\n\nStalinism was a development of Leninism, and while Stalin avoided using the term \"Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism\", he allowed others to do so. Following Lenin's death, Stalin contributed to the theoretical debates within the Communist Party, namely by developing the idea of \"Socialism in One Country\". This concept was intricately linked to factional struggles within the party, particularly against Trotsky. He first developed the idea in December 1924 and elaborated upon in his writings of 1925\u201326. Stalin's doctrine held that socialism could be completed in Russia but that its final victory there could not be guaranteed because of the threat from capitalist intervention. For this reason, he retained the Leninist view that world revolution was still a necessity to ensure the ultimate victory of socialism. Although retaining the Marxist belief that the state would wither away as socialism transformed into pure communism, he believed that the Soviet state would remain until the final defeat of international capitalism. This concept synthesised Marxist and Leninist ideas with nationalist ideals, and served to discredit Trotsky\u2014who promoted the idea of \"permanent revolution\"\u2014by presenting the latter as a defeatist with little faith in Russian workers' abilities to construct socialism.Stalin viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others. Ultimately he believed that all nations would merge into a single, global human community, and regarded all nations as inherently equal. In his work, he stated that \"the right of secession\" should be offered to the ethnic-minorities of the Russian Empire, but that they should not be encouraged to take that option. He was of the view that if they became fully autonomous, then they would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of their community; as an example he cited the largely illiterate Tatars, whom he claimed would end up dominated by their mullahs. Stalin argued that the Jews possessed a \"national character\" but were not a \"nation\" and were thus unassimilable. He argued that Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism, was hostile to socialism. According to Khlevniuk, Stalin reconciled Marxism with great-power imperialism and therefore expansion of the empire makes him a worthy to the Russian tsars. Service argued that Stalin's Marxism was imbued with a great deal of Russian nationalism. According to Montefiore, Stalin's embrace of the Russian nation was pragmatic, as the Russians were the core of the population of the USSR; it was not a rejection of his Georgian origins. Stalin's push for Soviet westward expansion into eastern Europe resulted in accusations of Russian imperialism.\n\n\n== Personal life and characteristics ==\n\nEthnically Georgian, Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language, and did not begin learning Russian until the age of eight or nine. He remained proud of his Georgian identity, and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian. According to Montefiore, despite Stalin's affinity for Russia and Russians, he remained profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality. Stalin's colleagues described him as \"Asiatic\", and he told a Japanese journalist that \"I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian\". Service also noted that Stalin \"would never be Russian\", could not credibly pass as one, and never tried to pretend that he was. Montefiore was of the view that \"after 1917, [Stalin] became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship.\"Stalin had a soft voice, and when speaking Russian did so slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing. In private he used coarse language, although avoided doing so in public. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was \"simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics\". He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness. Throughout his life, he used various nicknames and pseudonyms, including \"Koba\", \"Soselo\", and \"Ivanov\", adopting \"Stalin\" in 1912; it was based on the Russian word for \"steel\" and has often been translated as \"Man of Steel\".\n\nIn adulthood, Stalin measured 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m) tall. To appear taller, he wore stacked shoes, and stood on a small platform during parades. His mustached face was pock-marked from smallpox during childhood; this was airbrushed from published photographs. He was born with a webbed left foot, and his left arm had been permanently injured in childhood which left it shorter than his right and lacking in flexibility, which was probably the result of being hit, at the age of 12, by a horse-drawn carriage.During his youth, Stalin cultivated a scruffy appearance in rejection of middle-class aesthetic values. He grew his hair long and often wore a beard; for clothing, he often wore a traditional Georgian chokha or a red satin shirt with a grey coat and red fedora. From mid-1918 until his death he favoured military-style clothing, in particular long black boots, light-coloured collarless tunics, and a gun. He was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes. He had few material demands and lived plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture; his interest was in power rather than wealth.As Soviet leader, Stalin typically awoke around 11 am, with lunch being served between 3 and 5 pm and dinner no earlier than 9 pm; he then worked late into the evening. He often dined with other Politburo members and their families. As leader, he rarely left Moscow unless to go to one of his dachas; he disliked travel, and refused to travel by plane. His choice of favoured holiday house changed over the years, although he holidayed in southern parts of the USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and again from 1945 to 1951. Along with other senior figures, he had a dacha at Zubalova, 35 km outside Moscow, although ceased using it after Nadya's 1932 suicide. After 1932, he favoured holidays in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, Nestor Lakoba. In 1934, his new Kuntsevo Dacha was built; 9 km from the Kremlin, it became his primary residence. In 1935 he began using a new dacha provided for him by Lakoba at Novy Afon; in 1936, he had the Kholodnaya Rechka dacha built on the Abkhazian coast, designed by Miron Merzhanov.\n\n\n=== Personality ===\n\nTrotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity. This gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union during his lifetime but was misleading. According to Montefiore, \"it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that Stalin was always exceptional, even from childhood\". Stalin had a complex mind, great self-control, and an excellent memory. He was a hard worker, and displayed a keen desire to learn; when in power, he scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware. According to Volkogonov, \"Stalin's private life and working life were one and the same\"; he did not take days off from political activities.Stalin could play different roles to different audiences, and was adept at deception, often deceiving others as to his true motives and aims. Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being \"several Stalins\" as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality. He was a good organiser, with a strategic mind, and judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness. He acknowledged that he could be rude and insulting, although rarely raised his voice in anger; as his health deteriorated in later life he became increasingly unpredictable and bad tempered. Despite his tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming; when relaxed, he cracked jokes and mimicked others. Montefiore suggested that this charm was \"the foundation of Stalin's power in the Party\".Stalin was ruthless, temperamentally cruel, and had a propensity for violence high even among the Bolsheviks. He lacked compassion, something Volkogonov suggested might have been accentuated by his many years in prison and exile, although he was capable of acts of kindness to strangers, even amid the Great Terror. He was capable of self-righteous indignation, and was resentful, vindictive, and vengeful, holding onto grievances against others for many years. By the 1920s, he was also suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing that people were plotting against him and that there were vast international conspiracies behind acts of dissent. He never attended torture sessions or executions, although Service thought Stalin \"derived deep satisfaction\" from degrading and humiliating people and keeping even close associates in a state of \"unrelieved fear\". Montefiore thought Stalin's brutality marked him out as a \"natural extremist\"; Service suggested he had a paranoid or sociopathic personality disorder. Other historians linked his brutality not to any personality trait, but to his unwavering commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and the international Marxist\u2013Leninist cause.\n\nKeenly interested in the arts, Stalin admired artistic talent. He protected several Soviet writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, even when their work was labelled harmful to his regime. He enjoyed music, owning around 2,700 records, and frequently attending the Bolshoi Theatre during the 1930s and 1940s. His taste in music and theatre was conservative, favouring classical drama, opera, and ballet over what he dismissed as experimental \"formalism\". He also favoured classical forms in the visual arts, disliking avant-garde styles like cubism and futurism. He was a voracious reader, with a library of over 20,000 books. Little of this was fiction, although he could cite passages from Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Walt Whitman by heart. He favoured historical studies, keeping up with debates in the study of Russian, Mesopotamian, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history. An autodidact, he claimed to read as many as 500 pages a day, with Montefiore regarding him as an intellectual. Stalin also enjoyed watching films late at night at cinemas installed in the Kremlin and his dachas. He favoured the Western genre; his favourite film was the 1938 picture Volga Volga.Stalin was a keen and accomplished billiards player, and collected watches. He also enjoyed practical jokes; he for instance would place a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and wait for them to sit on it. When at social events, he encouraged singing, as well as alcohol consumption; he hoped that others would drunkenly reveal their secrets to him. As an infant, Stalin displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His Volynskoe suburb had a 20-hectare (50-acre) park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities.Stalin publicly condemned anti-Semitism, although was repeatedly accused of it. People who knew him, such as Khrushchev, suggested he long harbored negative sentiments toward Jews, and anti-Semitic trends in his policies were further fueled by Stalin's struggle against Trotsky. After Stalin's death, Khrushchev claimed that Stalin encouraged him to incite anti-Semitism in Ukraine, allegedly telling him that \"the good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews.\" In 1946, Stalin allegedly said privately that \"every Jew is a potential spy.\" Conquest stated that although Stalin had Jewish associates, he promoted anti-Semitism. Service cautioned that there was \"no irrefutable evidence\" of anti-Semitism in Stalin's published work, although his private statements and public actions were \"undeniably reminiscent of crude antagonism towards Jews\"; he added that throughout Stalin's lifetime, the Georgian \"would be the friend, associate or leader of countless individual Jews\". According to Beria, Stalin had affairs with several Jewish women.\n\n\n=== Relationships and family ===\n\nFriendship was important to Stalin, and he used it to gain and maintain power. Kotkin observed that Stalin \"generally gravitated to people like himself: parvenu intelligentsia of humble background\". He gave nicknames to his favourites, for instance referring to Yezhov as \"my blackberry\". Stalin was sociable and enjoyed a joke. According to Montefiore, Stalin's friendships \"meandered between love, admiration, and venomous jealousy\". While head of the Soviet Union he remained in contact with many of his old friends in Georgia, sending them letters and gifts of money.According to Montefiore, in his early life Stalin \"rarely seems to have been without a girlfriend\". He was sexually promiscuous, although rarely talked about his sex life. Montefiore noted that Stalin's favoured types were \"young, malleable teenagers or buxom peasant women\", who would be supportive and unchallenging toward him. According to Service, Stalin \"regarded women as a resource for sexual gratification and domestic comfort\". Stalin married twice and had several offspring.Stalin married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. According to Montefiore, theirs was \"a true love match\"; Volkogonov suggested that she was \"probably the one human being he had really loved\". When she died, Stalin said \"This creature softened my heart of stone.\" They had a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed Stalin. Yakov had a daughter, Galina, before fighting for the Red Army in the Second World War. He was captured by the German Army and then committed suicide.Stalin's second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva; theirs was not an easy relationship, and they often fought. They had two biological children\u2014a son, Vasily, and a daughter, Svetlana\u2014and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921. During his marriage to Nadezhda, Stalin had affairs with many other women, most of whom were fellow revolutionaries or their wives. Nadezdha suspected that this was the case, and committed suicide in 1932. Stalin regarded Vasily as spoiled and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin's son, Vasily nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle. Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood, and was also very fond of Artyom. In later life, he disapproved of Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on his relationship with her. After the Second World War, he made little time for his children and his family played a decreasingly important role in his life. After Stalin's death, Svetlana changed her surname from Stalin to Allilueva, and defected to the U.S.After Nadezdha's death, Stalin became increasingly close to his sister-in-law Zhenya Alliluyeva; Montefiore believed that they were probably lovers. There are unproven rumours that from 1934 onward he had a relationship with his housekeeper Valentina Istomina. Stalin had at least two illegitimate children, although he never recognised them as being his. One of them, Konstantin Kuzakov, later taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute, but never met his father. The other, Alexander, was the son of Lidia Pereprygia; he was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman and the Soviet authorities made him swear never to reveal that Stalin was his biological father.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin, \"perhaps [...] determined the course of the twentieth century\" more than any other individual. Biographers like Service and Volkogonov have considered him an outstanding and exceptional politician; Montefiore labelled Stalin as \"that rare combination: both 'intellectual' and killer\", a man who was \"the ultimate politician\" and \"the most elusive and fascinating of the twentieth-century titans\". According to historian Kevin McDermott, interpretations of Stalin range from \"the sycophantic and adulatory to the vitriolic and condemnatory\". For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer; for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder.Stalin strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union; Service suggested that without him the country might have collapsed long before 1991. In under three decades, Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a major industrial world power, one which could \"claim impressive achievements\" in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education, and Soviet pride. Under his rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition, and medical care; mortality rates also declined. Although millions of Soviet citizens despised him, support for Stalin was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society. Yet Stalin's necessity for Soviet Union's economic development has been questioned, with it being argued that Stalin's policies from 1928 on may have only been a limiting factor.\n\nStalin's Soviet Union has been characterised as a totalitarian state, with Stalin its authoritarian leader. Various biographers have described him as a dictator, an autocrat, or accused him of practicing Caesarism. Montefiore argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party oligarchy, in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship, with Stalin only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated. According to Kotkin, Stalin \"built a personal dictatorship within the Bolshevik dictatorship\". In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere he came to be portrayed as an \"Oriental despot\". The biographer Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as \"one of the most powerful figures in human history\", while McDermott stated that Stalin had \"concentrated unprecedented political authority in his hands\", and Service noted that by the late 1930s, Stalin \"had come closer to personal despotism than almost any monarch in history\".\n\nMcDermott nevertheless cautioned against \"over-simplistic stereotypes\"\u2014promoted in the fiction of writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasily Grossman, and Anatoly Rybakov\u2014that portrayed Stalin as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life through repression and totalitarianism. Service similarly warned of the portrayal of Stalin as an \"unimpeded despot\", noting that \"powerful though he was, his powers were not limitless\", and his rule depended on his willingness to conserve the Soviet structure he had inherited. Kotkin observed that Stalin's ability to remain in power relied on him having a majority in the Politburo at all times. Khlevniuk noted that at various points, particularly when Stalin was old and frail, there were \"periodic manifestations\" in which the party oligarchy threatened his autocratic control. Stalin denied to foreign visitors that he was a dictator, stating that those who labelled him such did not understand the Soviet governance structure.A vast literature devoted to Stalin has been produced. During Stalin's lifetime, his approved biographies were largely hagiographic in content. Stalin ensured that these works gave very little attention to his early life, particularly because he did not wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians. Since his death many more biographies have been written, although until the 1980s these relied largely on the same sources of information. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet administration various previously classified files on Stalin's life were made available to historians, at which point Stalin became \"one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda\" in the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about Stalin coming to light, and producing a flood of new research.Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin's authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them. The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism, or a totally unique mode of production. Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's actions damaged \"the enormous appeal of socialism generated by the October Revolution\".\n\n\n=== Death toll and allegations of genocide ===\n\nWith a high number of excess deaths occurring under his rule, Stalin has been labeled \"one of the most notorious figures in history\". These deaths occurred as a result of collectivisation, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to the regime.\n\nOfficial records reveal 799,455 documented executions in the Soviet Union between 1921 and 1953; 681,692 of these were carried out between 1937 and 1938, the years of the Great Purge. However, according to Michael Ellman, the best modern estimate for the number of repression deaths during the Great Purge is 950,000\u20131.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention, or soon after their release. In addition, while archival data shows that 1,053,829 perished in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953, the current historical consensus is that of the 18 million people who passed through the Gulag system from 1930 to 1953, between 1.5 and 1.7 million died as a result of their incarceration. The historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft and Michael Ellman attribute roughly 3 million deaths to the Stalinist regime, including executions and deaths from criminal negligence. Wheatcoft and historian R. W. Davies estimate famine deaths at 5.5\u20136.5 million while scholar Steven Rosefielde gives a number of 8.7 million. The American historian Timothy D. Snyder in 2011 summarised modern data, made after the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s, and concludes that Stalin's regime was responsible for 9 million deaths, with 6 million of these being deliberate killings. He notes that the estimate is far lower than the estimates of 20 million or above which were made before access to the archives.Historians continue to debate whether or not the 1932\u201333 Ukrainian famine\u2014known in Ukraine as the Holodomor\u2014should be called a genocide. Twenty six countries officially recognise it under the legal definition of genocide. In 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament declared it to be such, and in 2010 a Ukrainian court posthumously convicted Stalin, Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior, and other Soviet leaders of genocide. Popular among some Ukrainian nationalists is the idea that Stalin consciously organised the famine to suppress national desires among the Ukrainian people. This interpretation has been rejected by more recent historical studies. These have articulated the view that\u2014while Stalin's policies contributed significantly to the high mortality rate\u2014there is no evidence that Stalin or the Soviet government consciously engineered the famine. The idea that this was a targeted attack on the Ukrainians is complicated by the widespread suffering that also affected other Soviet peoples in the famine, including the Russians. Within Ukraine, ethnic Poles and Bulgarians died in similar proportions to ethnic Ukrainians. Despite any lack of clear intent on Stalin's part, the historian Norman Naimark noted that although there may not be sufficient \"evidence to convict him in an international court of justice as a genocidaire [...] that does not mean that the event itself cannot be judged as genocide\".\n\n\n=== In the Soviet Union and its successor states ===\nShortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinization. Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult, which was subsequently criticised in Pravda. In 1956, Khrushchev gave his \"Secret Speech\", titled \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", to a closed session of the Party's 20th Congress. There, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for both his mass repression and his personality cult. He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962. In October 1961, Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis next to the Kremlin walls, the location marked only by a simple bust. Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd.Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation process in Soviet society ended when he was replaced as leader by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union. In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of Stalin's legacy, but on both occasions were defeated by critics within the Soviet and international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first President of the new Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, continued Gorbachev's denunciation of Stalin but added to it a denunciation of Lenin. His successor, Vladimir Putin, did not seek to rehabilitate Stalin but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under Stalin's leadership rather than the Stalinist repressions; however, in October 2017 Putin opened the Wall of Grief memorial in Moscow, noting that the \"terrible past\" would neither be \"justified by anything\" nor \"erased from the national memory\".\n\nAmid the social and economic turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed Stalin as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride. He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right. In the 2008 Name of Russia television show, Stalin was voted as the third most notable personality in Russian history. Polling by the Levada Center suggest Stalin's popularity has grown since 2015, with 46% of Russians expressing a favourable view of him in 2017 and 51% in 2019. At the same time, there was a growth in pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, much relying upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material. In this literature, Stalin's repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat \"enemies of the people\" or the result of lower-level officials acting without Stalin's knowledge.The only part of the former Soviet Union where admiration for Stalin has remained consistently widespread is Georgia. Many Georgians resent criticism of Stalin, the most famous figure from their nation's modern history; a 2013 survey by Tbilisi University found 45% of Georgians expressing \"a positive attitude\" to him. Some positive sentiment can also be found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. A 2012 survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment found 38% of Armenians concurring that their country \"will always have need of a leader like Stalin\". In early 2010 a new monument to Stalin was erected in Zaporizhia, Ukraine; in December unknown persons cut off its head and in 2011 it was destroyed in an explosion. In a 2016 Kiev International Institute of Sociology poll, 38% of respondents had a negative attitude to Stalin, 26% a neutral one and 17% a positive, with 19% refusing to answer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union\nForeign relations of the Soviet Union\nIndex of Soviet Union-related articles\nList of places named after Joseph Stalin\nStalin and the Scientists\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nApplebaum, Anne (2003).

        "wiki": "Ishibutai Kofun (\u77f3\u821e\u53f0\u53e4\u58b3) is a stone kofun tumulus of the Asuka period in the east of Shimanosh\u014d, Asuka, Nara Prefecture, Japan. The kofun is believed to be the tomb of Soga no Umako. It occupies a space of 54 m (177 ft), and is the largest known megalithic structure in Japan. The kofun is also known as the Ishibutoya (\u77f3\u592a\u5c4b) Kofun.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the kofun in Japanese is a combination of two words, the first, ishi (\u77f3), meaning \"stone\", and the second, butai (\u821e\u53f0), meaning \"stage\". The name of the kofun therefore originates in its resemblance to a large stone stage. The Ishibutai Kofun has been known by this name at least as early as the Tokugawa period, as evidenced by its entry in the Saigoku sanj\u016bsansho meisho zue, a large guide to Buddhist pilgrimage sites written by Kanenari Akatsuki in 1853.\n\n\n== Association with Soga no Umako ==\nThe Ishibutai Kofun is inferred to be the tomb of Soga no Umako (559? - 626), and his death during the reign of Empress Suiko is recorded in the \"Nihon shoki\".\n\nSummer, 5th month, 20th day. The Oho-omi died. He was buried in the tomb at Momohama.The historian and archeologist Sadakichi Kita (1871 - 1939) proposed that the Ishibutai Kofun is the above-mentioned \"Momohana\" tomb in the 'Nihon shoki. Kita also proposed that the earthen mound of the Ishibutai Kofun was removed after Soga no Umako's death as a punishment of the Soga clan by the imperial government.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Ishibutai Kofun was built on a spur of a mountain that falls northeast to a small plateau. It consists of a platform, a gallery entryway, stone walls that form a tomb, two large stones that form a ceiling for the tomb, and embankments on either side of the tomb. In total 30 stones were used to construct the Ishibutai Kofun. The large granite megaliths come from Mount T\u014dnomine, which is approximately 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) from the site.\n\n\n=== Platform and moat ===\nThe Ishibutai Kofun originally occupied a much larger area than is evidenced by the existing stone tumulus. It was built on a square platform, which measured 50 m (164 ft) on each side at the time of construction. Archeological excavations have revealed that the kofun was surrounded by a moat, a feature typical of other kofun of the period. This moat is estimated to be 12 m (39 ft) wide. In total the kofun, platform, and moat probably covered an area 85 m (279 ft) long.\n\n\n=== Approach ===\nKofun typically had a stone approach to the entrance path of the tomb. The Ishibutai has a particularly long entrance path, which measures 38 m (125 ft). A shallow drainage channel 11.5 m (38 ft) long and 2.55 m (8 ft) wide runs the length of the entrance path. This entrance was originally covered like the tomb, but its stone ceiling no longer exists.\n\n\n=== Tomb ===\nThe Ishibutai Kofun is a yokoana (\u6a2a\u7a74) corridor-type tomb. The inner chamber is 7.5 m (25 ft) long, 3.4 m (11 ft) wide, and 4.8 m (16 ft) high. It consists of 30 stones, 4.7 m (15 ft) by 3.5 m (11 ft) and 7.7 m (25 ft). Small drainage channels run along the east, north, and west of the tomb. These were constructed to drain water collects on the north side of the tomb to feed south into the shallow drainage channel in the kofun entry.\n\n\n=== Ceiling ===\nThe Ishibutai Kofun is especially noted for the megaliths that form the ceiling of the tomb. The ceiling of the tomb is formed by two megaliths, one to the north and one to the south. The megalith at the north of the tomb weighs approximately 60 t (59 long tons), and the larger stone to the south weighs approximately 77 t (76 long tons).\n\n\n=== Mound ===\nThe Ishibutai Kofun was originally a large, flat h\u014dfun (\u65b9\u58b3) type kofun; the existing stone structure was covered at the time of construction by a broad, flat earthen mound. This mound eroded slowly after the construction of the kofun, thus exposing the large megaliths of the tomb roof.\n\n\n== Excavation ==\n\nThe Ishibutai Kofun was first excavated by the archaeologist and academic K\u014dsaku Hamada (1881\uff0d1938). Imperial kofun have not been readily excavated in Japan. Due to its association with Soga no Umako, the Ishibutai tumulus does not have an imperial designation, and has thus seen extensive excavation. The kofun was first excavated in 1933, work on the base and moat began in 1935, and excavation of the tomb continued until 1975.\nThe Ishibutai Kofun excavation yielded no significant finds. Funerary objects were probably lost to grave robbery quite soon after its construction. Stone shards to the southeast of the tomb are the remains of a tuff sarcophagus. Numerous examples of gilt and bronze implements, as well as earthenware shards were found in the banks of the tomb approach. The excavation also revealed that other similar flat stone kofun were built to the north and south of the existing structure.The Ishibutai Kofun was designated a historical remain in 1935. In 1954 the kofun was fully designated as a Special Historic Sites (\u7279\u5225\u53f2\u8de1, tokubetsu shiseki), one of only 75 sites in Japan with this designation. As excavation of the Ishibutai Kofun continued after World War II, significant reconstruction of areas around the kofun were carried out. The kofun and its surrounding area is part of the Asuka Historical National Government Park.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe Ishibutai Kofun is accessible from Asuka Station, which is served by the Kintetsu Yoshino Line. The \"Kame Bus\" (Tortoise Bus), also called the Asuka Tour Bus/Asuka Circle Route Bus, serves all locations within the Asuka Historical National Government Park, and leaves hourly from Asuka Station. Bicycle rentals are also available at numerous points around the station, and cost approximately 1000 yen a day.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of megalithic sites\nList of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments\n\n\n== External links ==\nKofun\n\u98db\u9ce5\u8cc7\u6599\u9928\u30fb\u77f3\u821e\u53f0\u53e4\u58b3(in Japanese)\u3000\n\u98db\u9ce5\u8cc7\u6599\u9928\u30fb\u99ac\u5b50\u306e\u5893(in Japanese)\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Well worth a trip. Nara is very easily accessible from both Kyoto and Osaka by train. Can be done as a day trip but you may consider spending the night as there is plenty to see in Nara. Museums, cafes and plenty of scenic walks (with deer of course). The park is full of",
          "We went to Japan to play on the summer vacation last year. The weather in Japan is very cool and comfortable. There are many deer walking around in Nara Park. You can feed them rice crackers,people who like to interact with animals must love this place.And there are many cute",
          "Nara Park is quite large. In addition to tourists, you'll meet tons of deers. They're wild, but very friendly. Inside the park, you have grass areas, small rivers and creeks, temples... Really nice. However, it's quite full of people. It's a good idea to sleep in Nara and enjoy",
          "The park is beautiful, deer are very cute and it was only a short train ride from Osaka, the Japan Rail Pass covered the ticket from Osaka station. There were more deer then I thought there would be! Make sure to bow at them, as they will bow back (usually if you have food for",

They are waiting for you to feed them with some deer cookies that you can purchase at the park. Beautiful",

          "Nice to be in an open space, you can stretch your legs here. The deer are not big and quite tame, perhaps a little too expectant of being fed. Temples and shrines give the place extra interest and the visitor a route to follow.",

          "We visited Nara whilst staying in Kyoto to see the deer. They were so tame and placid eating the deer biscuits out of your hand. We found the ones at the south park of the park near the shrines and museum very tame in comparison to the ones in the north open part of the park-",
          "We spent a wonderful afternoon wandering through the park surrounded by the gorgeous deer. The atmosphere was calm and tranquil and feeding the deer their rice cakes was an absolute privilege. They are so gentle, even the ones who like to remind you that they\u2019re there are not",
          "One does not need to worry about a deer encounter when visiting Nara Park, there are literally hundreds of them wandering around. Most of them are primarily interesting in extracting deer biscuits from guests, packets of which can be purchased for 200 Yen a time. The deer bow",

          "Just a short walk from the train station. The deers roam free in and about the park, even on the road. They are pretty friendly but be aware not to agitate them. Walk through the park to get to other attractions.",

          "Im glad we did go here. We were greeted by lots of deers. We didnt buy the cookie though but they still came and greeted us with a bow. Fun to watch them rest, mingle and even snatch your bag \ud83d\ude1c The backdrop view was great too. This is the nicest park Ive been so far",
          "We had the 7-day JR Pass and took the Yamatoji Line from Tennoji Station to Nara Station. It was a fair distance to Nara Park, so we opted for the Nara city Loop Bus, 1-day pass, which was a good decision, for 500y. You'll need to wait at Bus stop No.2. Walk out of Nara",
          "I brought my brothers here during New Year's Eve and the park was packed full of people. The entire area was filled with festival stands selling amazing street food like grilled octopus, Kobe beef steak on a skewer, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, etc. There were tons of deer relaxing in",

          "Deers are everywhere, from the streets to temples and grass landscapes. Droppings are also everywhere, but the locals are sweeping it up when they see it. Dont get too concern with stepping on them. Apparently i went during the mating season; where they may be more",
          "It is an awesome experience, not only for my boys, but also for the parents! We are lucky we have a very informative tour guide who informed us on what to and not to do with the deer in the park to avoid aggressive behaviors of them. If you feed them, they will surely gather",
          "The deer here were VERY aggressive towards my children, they kept ramming them and knocking them down. One knocked my 3 year old son by the nub of a horn (they had already de-horned these creatures) and flung him through the air like a football. I hope that my children aren't",
          "I always imagined deers to be too uptight and ready to flee upon sensing the presence of people, but these deers made me appreciate them up close, so friendly. Be careful though feeding them, because once a deer gets a piece of acorn or deer food, the rest would gang up on you,",
          "Unlike other park..this park is a home of hundreds of deer. You can feed the deer by buying a biscuit which cost you 200 yen..however don't be afraid..since you hold the biscuit a lot of deer will coming to get the biscuit instantly..the park is clean..if you continue to explore",
          "It was a fun place for friends, families and couples. Note that you will need to buy biscuits to feed the deers (do not feed them with outside food). The deers are so smart, they learnt to bow their heads to beg for food, they are so very cute!",
          "Such a nice place to visit... you can walk around with a lot of deers... you can also feed them with some food they sell locally.. But be careful not to have spare food in you pockets because they can easily find them LOL). We enjoyed a lot!!!",
          "There are many deer here and they are rather calm until there is food. However, when you bow to the deer, some of the deer will bow back which is very cute. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while strolling in the park. Love the environment.",
          "Incredible and magic place! The deers are very charming and so sweet. As long as you treat them well they\u2019ll do the same! Definitely recommend feeding them with the crackers that are sold on site.",
          "Beautiful park with friendly cute deers as companions. Can relax enjoying the view while feeding the deers. Love it here",
          "Visited the park in mid Jan and was charged 200 yen for deer biscuits. Although wild, the deers are so used to Humans they almost seem docile, just minding their own business in this protected park. Animal instincts kick in when it comes to feeding with some, so conditioned,",
          "I went to Nara park this afternoon, walked around and fed the deers which were fun but my highlight was riding on the rickshaw. It was my first time so i was nervous but the experience was amazing. My driver spoke really well English and explained everything nicely and easy to",
          "Nara Park is a must to see and it's huge. Been there last month and the different colors and shapes of the trees and leafs are just simply unique, so as the view. If you go when there is not a big crowd, then even better because you can enjoy the peacefulness of the park.",
          "I was here in November, but just before the proper autumnal colours had arrived...nonetheless it was beautiful! I spent quite a lot of time wandering around the park in the quieter places away from the areas near the main road. I saw plenty of deer as you would expect as Nara",
          "Nara park is home to 1200 wild deer who are also quite friendly. The kids loved it! You can feed the deer but they can get too friendly! Entertaining to watch though!",
          "Nara Park is not a specific location. Asking where to find deer in Nara is like asking where can you find water in the Pacific. They\u2019re literally everywhere in the temples complex. Just go to Todai-ji temple and the entrance is filled with deers trying to come and lick you. The",
          "Cute deers and they interact with tourists. You can treat them biscuits that can be bought inside the park for 180 yen. Just walk deep inside the park, more deers you can find.",
          "Kids love trying to feed the deer. They\u2019re so overfed that amongst the dozens of deer at the front of the park, it took half an hour to find deer that would eat all the biscuits we bought. There are plenty of deer inside as well so you can hold onto the biscuits and feed the",
          "Had such a great time feeding the beautiful deer! We bought deer crackers and were amazed when they immediately came toward us and bowed asking for a snack. Be aware however, once they know you have food, they can get a little aggressive. I provided a cracker to one, then",
          "This park gave me a first deep impression is deers. The deers are cute and their eyes are stunning when they look at crackers. I afraid of them a little bit because I saw many people were been chased up by the deers. And they who were been chased up are taken the crackers. So I",
          "If you come to Nara you have to come here. The park is huge and definitely walk around in addition to feeding the deer. The deer are not afraid to come right up to you to get a biscuit and some maybe a little more mean than others. If you have small children this is something",
          "We visited Nara park and stayed there overnight, in a very comfortable inn, with wifi but no tv, wich was wonderful. The park is splendid, with its many temples and shrines scattered all around. The deers are everywhere, some of them more interactive, expecting to be fed with",
          "- amongst all the places we went to our recent trip in Japan, the encounter with \ud83e\udd8c deer\u2019s were the best and we truly enjoyed - train from osaka was only 40mins & convenient journey - accessibility to temples were also extraordinary",
          "Large park, vile toilets, cranky deer. We rode a bus from the train station to the park, which was easy and short. A large grassy park with oodles of adorable deer. The novelty wears off when the deer start gouging their horns into your children, or biting at your clothes",
          "The park is BIG. The deer are friendly. The deer and park are awesome. My kids just love to feed the deer and looking the deer bowed to you when the deer asking for food from you (my kid bowed back to the deer). A place cannot be missed.",
          "Nara. Boy, oh boy! It\u2019s such an interesting place to visit. And if you\u2019ve ever seen pictures of people feeding deer up close and personal while in Japan, well this is exactly where it\u2019s done. T",

          "Nara is famous for the deer that wander around the area, not just at Nara Park. The deer are generally friendly, but perhaps due to frequent feeding by tourists (you get to buy food for them at 200Y, as part of their fund-raising efforts in the deer conservation), they could get",

          "We paid for a tour that took us to Nara to see the Shrine there, and we got a quick chance to see and feed the famous deers that wandered the place entertaining people who visited the park. We really enjoyed the experience. We have teenage boys and they were entertained by the",
          "After 1000 torii gates then 1000 monkey photos, this was our 1000 deer experience. We walked pretty much aimlessly around ending up at the top of Mt Wakakusa. So peaceful and so beautiful. The deer are mostly friendly especially when you have deer crackers (200 yen per pack)",

          "This park is a gem. Lots of things to see and if you move away from the crowds you will find lovely gardens and places to explore. We went to a garden that was free for overseas visitors and it was quiet and peaceful. It was the highlight of the day. The deer were lovely but",
          "It is a beautiful park as long as you stay away from the most popular areas and you visit before or after the crowds. There are actually some good sports for autumn colours.",

          "As a resident of the NE US, the idea of spending time in a city where deer rule made us leery given the fact that deer are associated with Lyme Disease above all things. But: we enjoyed feeding the ravenous deer, loved watching them bow after being fed, and enjoyed the city,",
          "Lots to see here - the lakes, the forested areas, the deer and, in the autumn, the wonderful colours of the trees. We lost ourselves because one of the deer ate our map and only later did we see the warnings about it being the mating season when the deer can be a little",
          "This was our first venture out of our AirBnB, we used our Kansai Thru Pass (great deal, it includes almost all public transit except JP rail) to get there which was about 1.5hr rail ride. There is a market just outside of the train station (sorry I forgot the name) that has",
          "To me, the park is just for kids. basically is like a zoo with free roaming deers. but it is on the way to the famous todaiji temple though",
          "Nara Park near to the temple was really a nice spot for visitors of all ages. It was particularly beautiful during autumn period with the fall colors around. Visitors would spend time taking photos around as well as spend some money to purchase biscuits for feeding the deers",
          "Pretty park, fall trees, deer everywhere, temples. Lovely way to spend a morning. If you feed the deer you're looking to get swarmed.",
          "Autumn has arrived but still a lovely place to walk around and be greeted by the deer. 200 yen buys you biscuits to feed the deer. If you bow to them they bow to you! They are gentle but still wild animals - so not to play with. You must visit the Tokondo Hall and Kohfukuji",

          "As for foliage in the park and temples they pale by comparison to those at Tofuku-ji in Kyoto for example. Nevertheless do enjoy them during the short period when they are in bloom Nov/Dec. For 200\u00a5 here get yourself a pack of biscuits and you will guarantee yourself some good",
          "Anybody who likes one of the three things I mentioned on title will obviously have a great day in the park. Not too far from Osaka, you can easily reach Nara in 40 minutes from Namba station to Nara Kintetsu station. The park was full of colourful leaves as I visited the park",
          "You have to make sure you go early, we took the 8am train out of Nippombashi, so that you beat the tour buses. Once it gets crowded, it really isn\u2019t much fun. In the morning, you can walk around and enjoy the park and the temples. We were pretty fortunate to visit while there",

          "The park itself is only so, so. There are lots of deer roaming around freely which is fun for Kids. If you have more time to spend than you know how to fill up, then Nara can offer a laid back 'day off' from the busy city. You can safely skip Nara otherwise.",
          "Our trip to Japan was at the beginning of November. We decided on this park after reading reviews. We spent a lovely afternoon in the park, up close and personal with the deer. Many around, all keen and eager to approach as you open up the crackers. Crackers must be purchased",

          "I would highly recommend doing a tour to Nara. It's a massive place and apparently has 80 shrines/temples, but the main reason we went was for the deer. There are hundreds roaming around everywhere, and are just so chilled and friendly. When we visited, unfortunately there was a",
          "Day trip on catch from Osaka after visiting Kyoto. The park itself is quite large with many deer roaming freely. They will come to you if you are feeding them with food which can be bought from the stall. The deer do bow when receiving food. There is a large wooden temple in the",
          "Definitely must visit park. Wild deer so tame. Snacks on sale at park for feeding.deer do bow if u bow and feed them.be cautious some deer can be aggressive.",
          "Nara park is a beautiful park that houses 1200 deer throughout. They have learnt to bow to receive the special deer crackers you can feed them. However some a pushy and will bite at your jacket if you don\u2019t pay them attention.",
          "We went to Nara to see the deer after seeing online recommendations and also the recommendations of friends. It was fun to see the deer roaming so closely around Nara and to see them 'bowing'. We enjoyed the gardens - really really enjoyed the Isuien and Yoshiken Garden more!",
          "Like others report if you can wake up early and based inTokyo get there by 8:15am to enjoy deer feeding. 150Yen will get you the special Deer Senebi crackers and they can be bought all over the park at the same price. Arrive at Kintetsu station, it\u2019s right on the doorstep of",
          "As you approach Nara Park, you can see as baby deers roaming the park as people. They are pretty harmless and some may pose for pictures with you but if you have a deer biscuit in hand, they will love you!! The deer biscuits are 150 Yen and available along the park by street",
          "Saw so many people feeding any old thing to the deer. If you must then buy the silly deer biscuits but don\u2019t feed them your sandwich or your map. They are completely habituated to people and don\u2019t understand what\u2019s good for them. Just think. What is a deer supposed to eat??",
          "This park is very nice, deer are everywhere. And there are more than you can imagine. You can buy food to give them but they will start following you. They also poop all over so watch your steps.",
          "The buildings are breathtaking and the scale of the park, the Buddhas, temple, pagodas is stunning, but particularly during cherry blossom season it is a tourist zoo. It\u2019s still very enjoyable to visit and you can get good clear views of everything, but if I go again I would",
          "It was a perfect day at Nara. A bit difficult to get there via Osaka since the trains are all confusing. It was nice and sunny outside and there were SOOOOOO many deer! You can get crackers for them for like 5 USD. And it's more than enough to feed them. An amazing",
          "Nice day out in Nara. The deer are fun for every age. All hotspots of Nara are within 20 mins walking distance. Come in spring when the cherry trees are in bloom!",
          "Lovely park , very relaxing walk among the temples and the deer who do anything for a biscuit! Very relaxing.",
          "We visited Nara park in March, the weather was so good and it was such a warm day, which definitely helped. It was so much fun to walk around and get to spend some time with the deer - watching them bow politely and getting to feed them biscuits (you can buy these at the park",
          "It is a nice walk thru the park with lots of deer that love human beings for the food they get. They have also been trained to bow, a sign that they are requesting food. Stone lanterns line the path - very large number of these heavy sculptures!",
          "We stayed in Japan for 9 nights, visiting 4 cities, and Nara was one of the highlights from our trip. Despite being rather small, there were a surprising number of temples to visit, a multitude of deers to feed, nice hills to hike and some great restaurants too. The park is",
          "When visiting Nara Japan, the Nara Park is a place that visitors will pass through en-route to Isuien Garden, Todaiji and Kasuga Shine. You'll see many deer roaming around the park, on the pathways, and sometimes on the less-busy roads. Multiple vendors can be seen at the park",
          "We visited here from Kyoto by train and was worth the effort. We arrived early which was a good thing as it was very busy by the time we left just after 1pm.",
          "The park is very nice with deers everywhere bit it is crowded. There some spectacular trees, the walk around the park and temple is very easy. The park is clean and well maintained. It was a wonderful visit even with the crowd.",
          "There are a lot of deers here, and some may be quite aggressive, so don't attract too many deers at once, and don't tease them with the deer senbei. Don't feed them with food other than the sika senbei sold inside the park. (These are sold for only 150 yen, so just buy and",
          "An experience you should not miss. The park is just amazing. The local government is so helpful with a lot of free facilities and information points.",
          "It's a great place to visit all year round. Purchase some senbei for the deer and you are gold. Would advise to stay away from the more aggressive male deers though, they tend to bite at your belongings if you taunt them with food.",
          "Yes, if you have time in kyoto then its worth taking the train to Nara to see, feed and touch some of the hundred deers running freely in this huge park. The park has some temples and cherryblossom trees also. There is no entrance free to this park. The deers are cute and you",
          "We went here on our way to temples and shrines. There are deer everywhere. You buy special cookies for 150 yen to feed them. If they see you have cookies they can get a little aggressive. You are supposed to just go ahead and feed the ones close to you and not try and chose. The",
          "The Nara deer are all over the park and around the temples around the park. They are quite docile and it\u2019s good fun feeding them with the special snacks sold by vendors around the park and temples. Some of the deer also know how to bow to receive the snacks!",
          "If you\u2019re in Osaka or Ky\u014dto you definitely have to take the 30-60min train to nara! Take a walk from the station to the deers. It\u2019s really nice to see and get close to the mostly free animals. Buy some deer crackers and feed them! But be careful \ud83d\ude09",
          "We weren't actually here to feed the deers. However, it was fun seeing them and added to the ambience of the place. The park itself is nothing spectacular.",
          "A day trip to Nara is definitely a possibility from a cruise ship, using local trains and then your best foot forward. Public transport is not expensive and easily accessible. On leaving the port area, 200m to reach the station (C11 Osakako on map) take the dark green line",
          "The scenery was great, sakura were beautiful! However, lots of very noisy tourists. It was so annoying we decided to leave early. Be sure to check Yoshikien Garden, which is right next to Nara Park: free for foreigners, and much more calm than Nara Park!",
          "Do hide the deer biscuits once you had purchased them cos the deers will finish them up within seconds \ud83d\ude2d Do save some further up for cuter deers which are less aggressive and in exchange for better photos",
          "A great park - busy though. The deer really do bow to you and are very happy to be stroked - especially when you have the 'deer biscuits' that you can buy from vendors there. They can smell them a mile off!",
          "There are tons of people and the deer are completely tame. They run up to you if they think you have food. It could be a nice place to walk around but beware of the crowds.",
          "Lots of deers! They are very cute but please note that they are not that kind as you expect. Please beware of your clothes and bags, they may bite it. Don't think bowing means they are politely asking for food, it's a sign of \"I am annoyed\" And.....please do not feed them by",
          "Soo many deer around and a first time seeing them not afraid people, coming up so close in the open. You start feeding one, they all gather and start to surround you and headbutt you for food. Its quite hilarious seeing kids getting surrounded soo fast.",
          "a wonderful natural place! unfortunately when we were there the trees have not yet bloomed, but still a beautiful place! we can only imagine how beautiful it is when everything is pink! Absolutely great attraction are deer at the same way that you can feed bought cookies!",
          "It's one of highlights in my home town of Nara. Feed the deer and they'll chase you for sometime. It's a great place to see cherry blossom in spring and autumn colors in fall.",
          "If you enjoy parks, temples, and deer, head over to Nara which is a ~35 min train ride from Osaka. The moment you get off Nara Station, you\u2019ll have to take the 10 minute local bus to Nara Park using your IC card that cost 500 yen (reference link for more info). Nara Park is huge",
          "They look cute, friendly and if you bow they will also bow back. Grab a 150 yen deer biscuit and start feeding the deer and that's were it all starts falling apart. The deers are wild, always keep that in mind. Feeding one or two or even three was great experience but as soon",
          "We read articles and traveller's blogs mentioned the deer in Nara Park, we never thought there are so many deer. While it is fun or seem like a must to buy biscuits to feed the deer, but do bear in mind that these are wide deer that had not been tamed. They can be slightly",
          "The place is worth visiting period. So manny memories from the few hours that we spent there the first day, I will go back tomorrow to watch the rest but it was already worth it.",
          "There are 1000+ deer roaming in the open. The deer feed out of your hands. The smaller deer are pushed away by the larger ones. One has to make an effort to reach the younger ones.",
          "I love this place! After spending time in the hard to grasp craziness of Tokyo or Osaka, Nara is a breath of fresh air. Literally! Other than the amazingly beautiful Todaji temple and the hundreds of bowing, occasionally aggressive (turns out they really, really like 7-11 egg",
          "Me and my partner really enjoyed our trip to Nara Park. Famously to feed the deer, and as well as visiting the various temples. We didn\u2019t expect for there to be a big market on too, which was a plus so we could buy some street food (yakitori, takoyaki etc)",
          "We were told it was really nice, but it was far more than we hoped for! So many lovely things to see, such a nice park surrounding it all, and a ton of super cute domesticated deers. Must see!",
          "Very nice and large park with free roaming deer, shrines, and temples. Great day trip from Osaka or Kyoto. Don\u2019t miss the Todai-ji temple with HUGE Buddha statue inside, and many Shinto shrines in the southeast part of the park. Some deer are friendly, others... be careful. If",
          "The park is big with the does roaming free, they are very used to be near people, you can feed by hand, there are some old buildings and museums that are worth visiting, you won't be disappointed.",
          "If you like deer And cherry blossoms then this park is a good place to get a little outdoor activity in without the crowds of the temples and shrines nearby. Very easy to access on yellow shuttle bus along with the other significant tour stops",
          "Nara Park is a chill place to stroll and visit some shrines. And of course feed deers with the correct food sold by local on site. Males can be slightly aggressive when they smell the biscuits . Very large area to cover",
          "The park has a nice feeling to it. Lots of deers walking around, so be careful with all your snacks and food. If you have any on you, they'll most likely come for it, especially if they can smell it. Visiting there early morning is much nicer, especially for skipping the crowd.",
          "We have been here twice over 9 years, this time with our young boys that loved it as much as us, especially with the deer everywhere and being able to pet and feed them!",
          "What a place. My favourite place in Japan. Its not a zoo. The deer roam freely and you can feed them with food bought off of venders. Watching the deer bow in traditional Japanese fashion toget their snacks is incredible. Do not feed them unless they bow. Place is also",
          "Easy trip from Kyoto - we went for the afternoon. It was a 15-20 minute walk from the station. Huge park with lots of deer, and you can buy \"crackers\" to feed the deer. Kids love it, and it was fun watching people reacting to the deer. I wouldn't want to be there in summer",
          "Going to the Nara Park is definitely the type of an experience you won't ever forget. If you're hesitating whether to take a day trip from Kyoto or Osaka, or maybe even from Tokyo, then don't. Bright green grass everywhere you look, buddhist temples all around and on top of that",
          "Nara park is huge and there are hundreds of deer or all ages. There are three main sites (and lots of minor ones) to visit in the park and it really is fun wandering between them, buying rice biscuits and feeding the deer. We were there on a mild and dry day in February which",
          "Nara park is pretty big. You can wander aimlessly up and turn paths and through and around temple sites. You can also sit and people watch. The deer are also a star attraction. Bring good walking shoes and a mud map.",
          "You will without a doubt visit this park as it is where all the main temples are. At first I felt that the deer were a little exploited but you are overwhelmed with their cuteness. They do expect food and they can try to grab things from you. We did have some amazing experiences",
          "The park itself is nothing special - your typical temple lead-up with vendors and junk food What sets it apart is the deer and the cookies they sell to feed the deer. I hate deer - I live where they eat everything I plant. These guys are no different - they've been fed",
          "Of course you will see Deer in the park and get a chance to feed them. However there is more to see and do in the parl e.g. Toda ji Temple, Kasunga Taish Shrine etc",
          "Spent the afternoon in Nara and wished we had budgeted more time for there. Do at least a full day so you can really explore. The highlight of our trip was, of course, the hundreds of deer at Nara Park. Buy the cookies available for sale and walk around. The older deer seemed to",
          "I find theirs a lot do in the park, not just the deers. Don't forget to bring food for the deer. Nuts and fruit are what they like, the local lady told me. I did not see anywhere I could get any at the park, so bring your own. The rest of the park is beautiful, it's a must see.",
          "The park is an experience not to pass up. We took a longer walking route to get to the park and found where other deer like to get away from the more active part pictured which is also nice. If you\u2019re rushed by one of the males and he comes after all of your wafers, try handing",
          "What a place! Wild deer, beautiful scenery. You can buy deer biscuits for 150 yen per pack which is great fun to give to the deer as hey bow at you to ask for a biscuit. OK you might get mobbed like I did by friendly deer but it was so funny. One deer stuck his head in my",
          "We took the train from Kyoto to Nara for a day visit and are so glad that we did. As we travelled in March the park was full of cherry blossom and of course there were plenty of bowing deer around. I\u2019d certainly recommend taking a waterproof jacket cause although the weather",
          "There are so many deers, they are so friendly we can give them a food (we can buy it) Beatiful temple, clean and very calm",
          "i visited Nara in autumn and i must say it was perfect. cool breeze and beautiful autumn colors in trees, the green and yellow and orange... and the best part- DEERS!!!! there were so many of them everywhere. it felt like walking in some different world. u can buy crackers for",
          "Walking in between the deer, feeding them to crackers, enjoying an area with no cars, clean air. Just loved it.",
          "It is free to visit Nara park and those deers, but you need to pay if wish to going into the temple. There is a lot deer there and you can feed them by just buying some biscuit for them, some of those deer are quite polite which will bow to you. There is also shop selling",
          "Deer are friendly. The are waiting for travellers to give the a food. You can buy their food there. but the are very big and nice to explore",
          "Aside from visiting the adjacent Todai-ji temple (home to the Great Buddha Hall), Nara Park in itself is a perfectly good reason to make the trip to Nara. The deer roam freely and \"bow\" for your crackers (which can be bought from stands at the park). Some deer are very friendly,",
          "Nara Park is a big area. It takes at least 1 hour for travelers hiking around it. There're so many deers just strolling with you. They bow and waiting you feed them. So cute an experience you wouldn't miss!",
          "This is a must visit, the main attraction in Nara. There's no other place in the world with an open park full of deers roaming around. The deers are generally harmless, except some can get aggressive when they see/smell food. There are also some souvenirs shops in the park.",
          "There were a lot of deer. It was nice to pat them and be that closed to them. They were not shy at all. Some could get aggressive when they saw food.",
          "We spent a half day in nara park in Japan. We took the local train +local bus and arrived to the park. The Todai-Ji temple is also in the park so you can see it. In the park there are a lot of bambies travelling. You can but them creckers and feed them. Be carefull because some",
          "This is not my first time in this park and it may look amazing in the photos, deers here are smelly and will flock to you when they know you bought wafers to feed them. Don\u2019t be afraid though since they will never be aggressive. Touring Nara requires a lot of uphill walking.",
          "We enjoyed our Nara Deer Park trip. Deer are roaming around freely from the gate up to the park. They're not afraid of people and they will go near you once they know that you have their biscuit meal. They're so polite that if you bow 3 times, they will also bow 3 times.",
          "Deers are really cute. You can get biscuit to feed them. Really cool they made the wrapper edible so the deers don\u2019t end up choking on litter.",
          "This was easily the highlight of my trip. (I know that now, that my trip is over.) Before going to Nara, I was skeptic about the deer and the place thinking that it would be a rip-off for tourists having to buy all those deer senbei (treats) and stuff... But once I am in Nara,",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. The deer roaming around was a unique experience. Its worth a visit to experience this place and the deer. It was a little crowded with people screaming because the deer approached them, which was little annoying.. was a little like a children petting",
          "The main attraction for Nara Park is the hundreds of tame deer that roam free. We were certainly not disappointed. You can purchase deer biscuits from a number of sellers in the park for 150 yen. Once you are in possession of the biscuits the deer become your best friend,",
          "There are a lot of deer here and they are usually hanging out near the stands that sell deer biscuits. The biscuits were 300 Yen if I remember correctly and you get 5/6 in a pack. The deer are surely the boss here and they can be aggressive. I had a Starbucks bag and one deer",
          "We went to Nara as a day trip from Osaka. Caught the Kintetsu train from Namba station which was not long and was very convenient. Tha deer park is a short walk from the train station in Nara. And the deer are everywhere!!! We bought crackers and fed the friendly deer. They are",
          "Once you get to the park (it's free), Make sure to try a hand in feeding the resident deers. Deer Crackers are sold at stalls everywhere in the park for 150yen. Once the deers see the crackers, prepare to be swarmed. Some deers would most likely give you a light headbutt to",
          "The park is really huge and is very nice walking into it. Possibly with good weather is definitely more enjoyable (we got some light rain). Dont miss the impressively huge Todaji Temple inside the park!",
          "you get to feed deers around the park. you got to buy the deer crackers from the cart vendors along the way. A little smelly, but its worth it! the deers were really cute !",
          "This delightful Park within walking distance from the Centre and Main Railway station, is overrun by deer everywhere. However, there seemed to be less than my last visit a few years ago, but they are still delightful, and usually appreciate some appropriate food. There are",
          "Nara Park is a huge area and many of the historical and famous temples and monuments are located here. There are lots of deers roaming around the park. You can buy cookies from vendors and feed them. The deers were quite aggressive and some of them will follow you or pester",
          "Its great to look at them, but if you want to feed them, be careful. (150 yenes costs)They can be insistent. They grabbed my clothes. Son hermosos , pero si queres alimentarlos sale 150 yenes. Cuidado porque se acercan r\u00e1pido y son insistenten. Me agarraban de la ropa.",
          "We stopped here for half an hour on a day tour, which was enough time to buy some crackers and feed the deer but I could have easily spent 2-3 hours here wandering in the park, having a snack, and exploring the nearby temple. The autumn colors lasted into December this year so",
          "Excellent place to visit to breath the Japanese architecture, culture and nature. Three in one. :) As a tourist you become a part of a wonderful Japan. When the Japanese come to Europe, they take photos of everything. Now I understand why! We did the same. Japan is unique!",
          "The best part of this park is feeding the deers amd there are so much of them throughout the park. You can get them to bow to you before you feed every biscuit to them.",

          "At first my husband very skeptical visiting this place as he said that the doesn't want to travel to Nara just to feed the deer... But when reached there, he loved it.. they are not only full with deer... every where.. and all are very well fed, easy to find the seller for deer",
          "If you love Japanese culture and wild animals, then this place is for you. Located within working distance from Kintetsu-Nara train station, the park have reach cultural section. However, it is famous for its free-roaming deeps. You can purchase few biscuits and feed them. Don't",

          "It\u2019s a short walk from the train station and it is easy to find because of the deer roaming around the park. The deer are considered \u201cgod-sent\u201d that is why don\u2019t be surprised to see Japanese locals to bow and feed them. It is amazing to see the deer bows too and wait for the",
          "Nara Park is a great day out for the whole family!!!! You can see why it is so famous. A great relaxed atmosphere with 100's of deer to feed \"biscuits\" too, which can be purchased from stalls near by",
          "Nara park is such a big place which you can easily spent a day. It was our favourite place to visit. The deers are always hungry and will start bowing to you thinking that you will feed them. Please be careful with your paper maps as ours got nibble by them. Very worth a visit.",

          "We went for a day trip from Kyoto expecting to see a few deer. There were hundreds of them that just seemed to wonder around on their own terms. They did congregate near the biscuit sellers, but there were plenty all around the park.",
          "Very nice walk between two major attractions. Plenty of deers for taking photos. Can buy snacks to feed and attract them.",
          "The overall parc is nice, you can buy snacks for the deers and let me warn you if you have your japan railpass with you it's not a good idea to leave your pockets open ! a deer lefts a good teeth mark on my pass !! it was funny though, i don't mind ! some deer will headbutt you",
          "We have half day left before leaving Kansai so my wife and I decided to jump on the train from Osaka to Nara. Nara is not in our initial plan but we are so glad to make the journey. Nara\u2019s tourist attractions including Nara Park are within walking distance from the station so",
          "My son and I caught the train to Nara from Osaka. It was a short trip. The deers roam the park freely. They nudge your pockets if you have any food. You can buy a pack of biscuits to feed them. It was really cold and rainy the day we were here so it was a bit bleak and muddy but",

          "We visited in autumn and saw stunning autumn colors. This place is huge so take your time! The deer are used to people, but sometimes still get impatient if you dont feed them fast enough. The deer do head butt you and sometimes take decent bites, but just know this going in and",
          "Nara is about 40 Min. by train from Osaka and therefore a nice day trip. Best way to go is from Namba Station with a rpivate train company serving Kobe-Osaka-Nara. The train station in Nara is close to the Park sight. The park itself is huge and you can easely spend a whole day",

          "Apart from the friendly deers, we like the vast open space, greens n the many red leaves we saw in early dec. Nice park to wander around, taking walks with family, relax in the greens, etc..",
          "We brought our teenage girls to the park. It was nice to interact with the wild but tame deer. The place is crowded with tourists (as in many attractions in Japan). There are stalls selling deer food for tourists to feed the deer. We decided not to feed the deer after reading",

Asuka-dera is regarded as one of the oldest temples in Japan.\n\n\n== Temple complex ==\nA number of records refer to the origin of the temple, such as the Nihongi and Fus\u014d-ryakuki. The original buildings of what was then called H\u014dk\u014d-ji were constructed in 588, shortly after the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, under the orders of Soga no Umako. The temple was built using the guidance of masters and artisans from the ancient Korean kingdom of Baekje.Following the transfer of the capital from Asuka to Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (now Nara city), the buildings of Asuka-dera were also removed from the original site in Asuka to Nara in 718 CE, and developed into a huge temple under the name of Gang\u014d-ji. The original site of H\u014dk\u014d-ji was also maintained as a temple, which survives into modern times.The main object of worship at Asuka-dera is the bronze Great Buddha, which said to have been made by Kuratsukuri no Tori in the early seventh century. The statue is designated as an Important Cultural Property.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGang\u014d-ji\nHistorical Sites of Prince Sh\u014dtoku\nFor an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAston, William G.

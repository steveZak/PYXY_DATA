        "wiki": "Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife.\nDespite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew\u2014it had 14,000 residents by 1910\u2014conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe park covers an area of 117.21 km2 (45.26 sq mi) and is small in comparison to most of Africa's national parks. The park's altitude ranges between 1,533 and 1,760 m (5,030 and 5,774 ft). It has a dry climate. The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem. The park has a diverse range of habitats and species.The park is located about 7 km (4.3 mi) from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe park's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include African buffalo, baboon, eastern black rhinoceros, gazelle, Grant's zebra, cheetah, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotamus, African leopard, lion, common eland, impala, Masai giraffe, ostrich, vultures and waterbuck.Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.\n\nThe David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means \"Rhinoceros Sanctuary\". It is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nMervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.\n\n\n== Tourism and education ==\nNairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week.The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrett, Michael; Christine Riley (1995).

It was the first national park established in Kenya (1946), has an area of 45 square miles (117 square km), and lies about 5,000\u20136,000 feet (1,500\u20131,800 metres) above sea level. It consists partly of thick woods near the city outskirts, partly of rolling plains and valleys, and partly of a wooded confluence of several rivers. Its vegetation is of the dry transitional savanna type. Acacias and other thorny varieties, muhuhu, Cape chestnut, and Kenya olive are the most important trees. Scores of mammals, such as lions, gazelles, black rhinoceroses, giraffes, various species of antelope, and zebras, as well as numerous reptiles and hundreds of species of birds, inhabit the park. Only by establishing migration routes into nearby Ngong Reserve has it been possible to maintain wildlife in the area at its present levels. The Nairobi Animal Orphanage, founded in 1963, is located inside the park. The park\u2019s headquarters are at Nairobi.KenyaImpalas graze in Nairobi National Park in Kenya.James P.

          "Oh you have to do this for an experience of wild life safari. Its so Near the city. And the day we went, it rained, and still we were able to see the lions. We spotted 13-14 lionesses, buffaloes, giraffes, deers, gazelles, others.",
          "Kenya is known for its wildlife parks. I have sometimes heard a few people complaining that \"there are no animals\" in Nairobi National Park. When I am bored or I have 2 hours ahead, I just go there. I know it like my own garden. This is the best park to have the feeling of what",
          "Relatively excellent proximity from downtown Nairobi. Has ample animals which we saw from afar while walking to Rolf's Place for lunch.",
          "We were fortunate enough to see buffalo, zebra, giraffes and wilderbeast in abundance. We didn't see any rhino or lions. That said, the conditions were very poor when we visited and several roads were inaccessible. Sad to note that in the news following our visit a lion had",
          "It is Kenya's most accessible yet it is unique by being the only protected area in the world with a variety of animals and birds close to a Capital City. Our favourite was the lions den and cheetahs.",
          "unwind from the noise of the city at Nairobi National Park. The only City in the world with a National Park within its boundaries. Good for Game viewers and Bird watchers.",
          "The only place in the world where it is very close to the city and you can do game drives while watching the city sky scrappers.",
          "We spent 3 hours with our own vehicle and a guide who knew where to take us. We saw a lioness, 3 giraffes, several buffaloes, crocodiles, a tortoise, monkeys, Coke's hartebeest, gazelle, various bird species and a human with ants in his trousers. It's best early in the morning",
          "An extra day in Nairobi and we decided to take a tour in Nairobi National Park. Being a game park close to the capital we assumed going there in our own Toyota Kluger would be ok. But we were proven totally wrong. Whichever direction we tried we encountered high middle ridges",
          "have just completed my first safari in Kenya. It was organised by Southern Cross Safaris on behalf of Bench Africa. The accommodation varied from tented lodges to swish hotels. The safari took us to a number of game reserves, including Ambroseli, Lake Naivasha, the Masai Mara",
          "This is the best way to observe how the wild animals live, in their own natural habitat. It was amazing, you have to wake up really early, but it was all worth it, we saw lions, buffalos, crocodiles, giraffes, impalas. And more.. must see when in Kenya...",
          "Nice park, well mantained. There are lots of visitors but you should expect that from a prk situated within the city. I visited in a rainy day, hence the number of animals was way loser than an usual day.",
          "We saw all the animals! It was epic with some beautiful scenery, the land just went on and on and on.",
          "the trip started as early as 7:30AM, when we entered we saw very few animals and we were driving everywhere and following other Safari cars, but we didn't see any lion, the visit was very interesting, but by end of the visit I was very disappointed not seeing any of the big five",
          "It was great and have many wild animals after a good search..has picturesque views.Different types of antelopes are seen ,Lion, buffalo, hyena, zebras, giraffes among others...",
          "I know that it's not advisable to visit the national parks when its the middle of the rainy season but I did it anyway. I'm not sure I should have. I did a self-drive in a Toyota station wagon and I arrived at 9:00 am. The entry was smooth and we were able to drive into the",
          "It\u2019s just amazing that you can have a wildlife park so close to the city that you actually see buildings and the cityscape within the park. It had been raining for weeks when we went so the roads were in pretty bad condition and it was a very slow and bumpy ride. Nevertheless we",
          "Almost didn't go because we were returning from a fantastic safari. We were rewarded with wildlife that we didn't see in a different region against a back drop of beautiful Nairobi",
          "I've seen giraffes, rhino, lions, crocodiles, buffalos, zebras, impalas, ... in only 3 hours time! Just near Nairobi city, it's quite fantastic. I recommend for the persons who are staying shortly in Kenya, for work for example.",
          "The National park is amazing, the wildlife and bird life is the sensational.If you visit Nairobi this is the place to see.",
          "Located just south of the city, Nairobi National Park is Kenya\u2019s first National Park and the only protected area in the world that sits so close to a nation\u2019s capital. Visitors to the vast wildlife park are likely to spot black rhinos, lions, giraffe, and zebra, as well as some",
          "We hired a car with a driver to see the park If there is no rain, that's good way to do the tour. Nevertheless, after visiting Serengeti, Ngorongoro in Tanzania and South Luongwa park in Zambia, it would be fair to say that Nairobi NP can't really compete. Neither was that the",
          "Great place to visit out of Nairobi about one hour driving maybe more if rush hour it's a lovely park when you can see giraffes zebras etc..i went with guide and it was unforgettable experience",
          "It\u2019s a lovely getaway for half a day and great to see so many rhinos and lionesses. And then to end it with a picnic is quite a treat",
          "Visa on arrival without any issues. Booking safari straight in the airport is safe and reliable. 200 usd for 5 hours rent of specially designed open top mini bus. When entering the Nairobi National Park and surrounded by giraffes you feel yourself like in Jurassic Park ) Great",
          "Highlights are too many, we saw so many spectacular animals. Some even up close. Lions, giraffes, zebra, hippo, rhino, monkeys, hyenas, jackals, gazelle, warthogs, and the ever present guinea fowl. This was so enjoyable, I\u2019d do it again tomorrow.",
          "We saw a good variety of animals there. It is unfortunate a railway line with concrete pillars has been built through it. A good opportunity to see wildlife if you can't make it out to a bigger reserve.",
          "Despite being so close to Nairobi city the park has an impressive array of wildlife to see. A good place to see rhinoceros , both white and black. Best to go with a guided drive as the roads can get very muddy. A good option with limited time in Kenya or on a transit day.",
          "A National Park in the middle of the City giving the best view and experience at the park.Perfect Wildlife and wonderful Tour services from the amazing Ultimate Simba Tours.Its a Go againTour!",
          "We were booked by kenya bush expeditions tours and travel to the morning tour. The choice was perfect as the park is amazing with many animals to see. We saw lions, rhinoceros, buffaloes just to mention. Its highly recommended if traveling through Nairobi.",
          "This trip was so bad I have asked for a refund (and I believe others are too). The park is lovely, three lionesses paraded across the road right in front of us, lots of zebra and giraffes.... Viator totally failed in their part. $110 was supposed to get an expert guide and",
          "Considering that Nairobi National Park is in the middle of a massive city, it's pretty incredible. (It'd be great even if it weren't in the middle of a city, but given that it is, it's pretty awesome). Traffic can be a nightmare in Nairobi, but if you leave from near the city",
          "It was a nice place, but not a much animals, I saw in The Netherlands zoopark and those zoopark was very very bigger then this park. And also more animal was there. But the green, trees are beautiful. If you have time can go.",
          "Well regulated park. Very slow at check in due to some kind of computer issue but otherwise fantastic. It helped that we had a fantastic guide, Ben\u2019s safaris. We were looking for birds and in 4 hours of leisurely exploring we identified 92 species, including a number that I",
          "The park is a good place to start your safari holiday. As it is close to nairobi ofcourse and cause the main road is an easy drive. Other roads its better to have a 4x4. There is no map so you just have to guess which way your going. We didnt see that many animals but we did",
          "We got to see the 3 of the big 5 animals all in one place in their natural habitat.The Lion, Rhinos and Buffalos.There were several other animals too.However the entrance fee is quite on the high side especially for tourists.",
          "It is very nice and easy access since it is in Nairobi - literally. And indeed it is quite interesting to see the city from a national park. However, if you are visiting Kenya for more than seeing Nairobi, it definitely does not worth going. Once you are in Masai Mara, Amboseli",
          "It\u2019s amazing that there is a national park in the city. It\u2019s a great way to do a game drive without having to go too far! There were loads of animals and was super excited to see a lion!",
          "This park is basically in Nairobi and is the easiest way to get your Safari fix when you have a short time. I did it as part of a tour on my last day before my afternoon flight. I believe the park fee was $48USD. Immediately we saw a lion upon entering the park. It is",
          "First visit - got a taste of what to expect on a safari..saw our first rhino with a baby,submerged hippos, got blown away by graceful giraffes,and best of all saw a pride of 7 about 3 feet away from us - breath taking magical experience",
          "Went on an afternoon safari drive, saw loads of animals up close lions hippos white rhino zebra buffelo and more.. Even saw Pumba highly recommended",
          "Had an amazing time,saw many animals the giraffes and lions were the most impressive,the roads are bad and it was raining which gave an the impression of a n adventurous experience in the wild life",
          "Sick and tired of the typical tourist stops? We think we all deserve something new and exciting. Add something a bit out of the ordinary to your vacation plans.",
          "Went early on a Sunday morning and was able to see many of the animals. Most were hunting for their food and a few of them were enjoying a mid morning siesta. Very neat to have seen all the animals within the Nairobi city limits",
          "quite expensive to visit as a tourist but a very handy place to reach to see wild animals (and there are plenty of them in this park to be seen). once inside the park the roads are absolutely appealing and risky which makes for a very unpleasant outing. the crater size potholes",
          "The proximity to the city is the first surprise. The park is basically a savanna type with very few tress in the core area. This is a limiting factor in siting leopards and cheetah; to a lesser extent, lions too. We had a pleasant surprise of a group of three white rhinos close",
          "What a amazing safari park. We saw lot of wild animals, and our granddaughter\u2019s company driver let us nearly see all animals. We drove for 4 hours. Skyline behind the park is Nairobi City. You need a 4 wheel car. Must do if you\u2019re in Nairobi",
          "the nearest park from the CBD to be, for those that hate long distance tours.you shall enjoy wildlife watching.",
          "This is a great park so close to the city it is vast and has amazing game in here no elephants though so don't be surprised to not see any but the park itself is beautiful and the game we saw was great",
          "Went here in early October 2019. Just off Langata Road. We paid for tickets and drove through the gate-within 500 yards we were watching 3 lionesses devouring a baby giraffe right beside the road. This set the tone for the rest of our visit. Saw Rhino, Water Buffalo,",
          "I saw so many animals of every description,elephants,Giraffes,Birds,Eagles,Wilderbeast,Zebras,Antelope.",
          "As you travel through Nairobi National Park's 45 square miles, you'll find it hard to believe that you are in a modern city. The city's skyline in the distance, is the only reminder. The park is teeming with wildlife, all protected by aircraft overhead and discreet armed",
          "Extraordinary, fairly large (117 Km square) park close to Nairobi city-center (7 km), with abundance of wildlife. Sign-up/rent an open-top van and get their early (c. 7:00 AM) and see many unique animals, many up-close. From the van I shot some nice pictures with a 135 mm",
          "You will need your own transport or a driver to go around the National Park. Great collection of Rhinos with the city of Nairobi in the back ground. Saw Lions, Giraffe as well as Gazelle etc. There are no Elephants, but if you go early enough you can leave the Park and go onto",
          "Booked a car taxi for 55 usd and went early. Saw a pride of 15 lions and 3 rhinos. Couple of hours at most. If you want phone number of John my cabbie, let me know. Entrance is usd 43 pp. so 141 all up.",
          "We've been on safari in Botswana and thought that perhaps a half day at Nairobi's national park in sight of the capital city would be underwhelming. But it was the opposite. Our driver had a jeep with a roof that popped up so we could stand up when he found animals. We arrived",
          "This was a trip worth everything...Although my car got stuck somewhere in the jungle, the entire experience was too good to spoilt by that single bad experience. Advice to all who are planning to take this \"Game Drive \" . Don't do it with a saloon car, Or any low car/Dont do",
          "The Safari car came to pick us from our hotel in Westlands at 05:45 and we arrived the park at 06:20. Good time as the weather is still cool and the animals would still be coming out. Please bring a pullover as you will be driving in a car where the roof would be open for you to",
          "Like any other national park, but the only difference is that it located very close to the city. Being from South Africa, i have seen most the animals in close proximity already, so while this is still amazing, it was not a new experience for me. At the entrance of the Park,",
          "We were the first to arrive on a Monday morning at 630. Not many vehicles on the road even later. Were lucky to finally see black rhino and a lion. Lots of other wildlife seen during the 4 hours in the park. Is bigger than you think. One downside is you cannot leave the park",
          "A complete must. Especially as you are likely to see both white and black rhinos (we travelled extensively through Tanzania after and never saw any other rhinos so were so glad we saw them in the wild in Nairobi NP). Also saw loads of other mammals and birds - highly",
          "Wildlife near the City! This park has many animals that are easily seen such as water buffalo, crocodiles, giraffes, ostrich and lions! We were lucky enough to see a pair of lions not far from the road, it was late in the day and they were just sitting in the grass.",
          "Early in the morning game drive was wonderful to me, I was driving from the main gate, and the view was expecting as I approached the grassland.the view of the Nairobi city was amazing, and the wild animals grazing was good. I spotted various animals like lions buffalos ,Rhino,",
          "The place is soo beautiful, you can see and enjoy the life of the African animals.. However, the whole 3 hours trip was looking for the lion, which we did not find!!!!",
          "Driving to park to stay at ololi lodge just outside the park you drive down the motorway on oneside Nairobi the otherside the animals in the park.on the gamedrive we saw lions ,rhinos,crocodiles hippos many different birds and all is within 5 km of the city centre",
          "I booked Viator from Australia before I left. Once in the hotel I spoke with the tour manager and booked everything. I had ecotours and Stephen my guide turned up at 6.30 and off we went. His English was excellent and he made sure we got as close to the animals as possible",
          "If you have a short time to explore hit this place up. We saw some amazing views including lions and their cubs! Zebra, giraffes and wildebeests.",
          "We were taken on Safari By Australken tours and we really enjoyed our safari within a short time we had seen 2 rhinos, a group of baby lions, we couldn't believe our luck but a nice place to see wildlife.",
          "Lots of encounters with zebra, buffalo, giraffe, baboons, all sorts of antelope, hyenas, warthogs and a glimpse of a lion often taken against the back drop of the Nairobi Skyline.",
          "Our guide was excellent and our main aim was to see rhinos in the wild as we hadn\u2019t managed to see them in our previous safari location. And what a view we had seeing a crash of rhinos. It takes a bit of looking as the park is 46 square miles. Great opportunities for photos with",
          "Great place if you want to see all the animals within less than two hours. Very compact game reserve",
          "Amazing. Lots of buffalo, giraffe, warthogs,impala, zebra, lions. Saw a pride of lions eating an impala.",
          "It\u2019s ok... close to city but if you can go to other game reserves.... go The national park is an option for those who can\u2019t go to Maasai Mara or amboseli Tsavo Danbury etc. it\u2019s near nbo it has a fence so you always get to see something.... if you go try to go to the elephant",
          "Fabulous thing to have in Nairobi. Lions and leopards and cheetahs on the edge a big city? Amazing. Can rent a driver/open vehicle there at the park if you choose.",
          "We enjoyed a morning game drive with James who was our guide for the full day. We were able to see SO much in a short space of time. The only 2 of the big 5 we didn\u2019t see was the leopard and Elephant (but we did see both at the Masai Mara with James) The park is very open. So",
          "We were lucky enough to have a private game drive with an amazing guide and driver. The way they communicated with the other drivers to make sure we saw as many animals as possible was amazing - seeing the giraffes and zebras was the highlight for me but we also saw lions,",
          "Great national park. Value for money. Increadible all species in a park in the middle of the city. Very recommended",
          "As a precursor to our 11 day safari in Kenya and Tanzania, we decided last minute to spend an afternoon touring Nairobi National Park. We contacted an online clearinghouse that certifies tour operators for our request. Kenan Travel responded immediately and personally (many just",
          "Nairobi National Park is within Nairobi city limits. It is special and with 4/5 of the BIG five a must for nature lovers who visit or reside in Nairobi. There are no elephants in the park. You can do a self-drive safari or organize to be taken with a guide. Allow at least a",
          "This place was a wide range of animals and is so convenient being very close to Nairobi. The only major animal missing is the Elephant and this is because the park isn't large enough for them. Well worth a visit.",
          "no elephants, but simply outstanding!! a couple of entrances to choose from - credit card required. good to visit all year round.",
          "not far from Nairobi to see wild life. Can go early tin the morning to see the wild life. better chances to see the wild life in the mornings, Can get escorts for the games.Roads are muddy & rough.Have to pay the games fees to enter the national park..",
          "We paid to be collected at the hotel, and had the second half of the day to see the park. $ 175 pEr person for two, private safari jeep was pricey. The guide was very good and we saw everything except lions and leopards. Apparently 42 lions present, and a few leopards.",
          "first we can take the personal vehicle thru safari. The guide and the driver are very courteous and helpful .",
          "How amazing to have a fabulous national park at a city\u2019s doorstep! We were at the entrance to the park by 6:30am travelling in a van with a roof top that can pop up, so we can stand and look out to spot the animals. It is incredible to see the animals in the plains, sometimes",

          "While I was working in Kenya for two months, I took advantage of two Safari's. The first was to Nairobi National Park, which was a day-trip. So this is perfect if you are crunched for time! It is one of the more expensive excursions, but well worth the investment. It's a short",
          "Our experience of the Nairobi National Park was just amazing. Our tour guide just great, he did everything he could to make our tour memorable with experiencing the wild life. The weather was very cold and foggy. We got to see zebras Rhinos buffaloes masai female giraffes",
          "The National Park has the City scape in the background. The visit was amazing , we saw a variety of animals, rhinos, lions, zebras, giraffes , etc. A great way to spend a magical time in Nairobi.",
          "Decent game, quite few rhinos. Unfortunatly there is quite a few cars here. Fairly decent roads for a national park and densly populated with animals.",
          "I went on a last minute Safari with my other half and some friends. Despite us seeing a fair few animals, so worth it for that, the price was ok, but it could of done with being open until 7pm as advertised but really it shuts at 6pm. You are not guaranteed to see any animals",
          "We have visited the park twice - 2018 and 2019 - well worth a trip. Black Rhino (seen on both trips)/zebra/giraffe/leopard/lion etc etc Some superb viewing / picnic spots. Amazing place considering within the city boundaries.",
          "Where else in the world would you come out of your house and in a matter of an hour, you are amidst the predators viz Lion and Cheetah, unless you are in Nairobi, KENYA. I am referring to the Nairobi National Park. It was Saturday 6.30 AM, we picked our guest from the hotel and",
          "The Nairobi skyline is always present - this makes the setting of this park extra special. So much wildlife - so many different species of birds are to be seen in this park. Roads are dusty but in very good condition. It can get a bit busy, specially in the morning and",
          "We spent a great day out here at the end of our Kenya trip instead of paying for extra time in our hotel before our check out, we hired a driver for the afternoon then he took us straight on to the airport. Great viewing close to the city, We saw a family of lions and various",
          "I visited the park on my first day in Nairobi, it was before sunset and the views were breathtaking. We saw zebras, giraffes, lions, a hippo, and many birds. It was truly ana amazing place overlooking the city of Nairobi <3",
          "The only wildlife capital you see a lot of wildlife just a few miles from capital center it never disappoint for the nature has much to offer especially for budget tourist who don't need to travel for long to look for the wildlife",
          "Visited the park for the second time and the experience was so amazing. The park well kept clean and with trees all over the atmosphere is perfect. Entry procedures now easy and payment process made easier as you don't have to walk around with cash.You can pay using your debit",
          "The proximity to the city makes this national park so easy to access and the animals inside don't disappoint.",
          "Lots and lots expensive hype. 43 dollars a head and no working toilets in the entire park? Where exactly is the ticket money going? Seems like a real sham. Very few animals, rough roads, and if you get stuck with a crappy tour company it gets worse. What could likely be a state",
          "We spent the morning in the National Park. It was unreal to have the cityscape as the backdrop to the park. We were told before that you never know what you will see. It was truly breath-taking we saw so many animals, Lions, Hippos, Giraffes, Rhinos, Ostriches, Buffalos,",
          "I love going to Nairobi National Park to spend time with Nature. If you are even for half day in Nairobi, this is must place to Visit. Within half an hour of Game drive, you will realise what a superb decision you have made by coming here. You will see Gazelles, Zebra, Rhinos",
          "What more can be exciting than the fact that road you are driving on is parallel to a national park where wildlife lives untouched Subhanallah!!! Must visit if you are in Nairobi for a meeting and don\u2019t have enough time to go to the mara Nairobians -KWS needs our support -",
          "I was in the Nairobi National Park for half a day, not having big expectations. I thought the highlight would be Masai Mara. Actually on my half day in Nairobi National Park I saw a lot more! When we arrived there were lions eating. During the day a rhino passed our way right",
          "I was in Nairobi for a few days recovering from jet leg. I hadn't planned to visit the park because I was already booked to go to Ambroseli and the Maasai Mara. I'm very happy I changed my mind. I arranged a private driver through my hotel. After 2.5 hours in the park, I saw",
          "I had been put off my some reviews that said it\u2019s not worth going here after a full safari, however this was not the case for us. To escape the busy city and be close to nature again was the perfect way to end our trip before heading to the airport. The National Park has the",
          "It was a fun visit and we saw most of the animals, but it requires and early start and the ticket purchasinng is totally inefficient so I would recommend getting there at 6:00am. It also has the advantage that it is cooler. The park is not very large so can be visited in about 4",
          "It's wild that a park so close to Nairobi's bustling streets can have so much wildlife. It's possible to make this day trip affordable by going with a large group (there were 8 of us) to share transportation. We hired a matatu safari vehicle, and split by 8 it was around $10 USD",
          "The game drive into the park was good with 9 rhinos seen in the space of 2 hours but the arrogance of the gate staff combined with pointed words that a 'muzungu' can afford 43 Dollars entrance fee while being an East African resident, left a sour taste in my mouth. Thumbs down",
          "After long flights from the US east coast (via London), we wanted to rest for a couple of days before starting our more intensive game watching in Kenya and Tanzania. We decided to spend two full days in Nairobi to get acclimated especially since we arrived late in the evening.",
          "We didn't manage to do the Safari (best done in the early morning), but went to the 'Zoo/Animal Hospital' part where we hired a guide to talk to us about the animals, the country, its politics and its people. Well worth the money, he was funny, knowledgeable and shared some",
          "Really nice place to visit while in Nairobi. We got to see a lot of zebras, rhinos, giraffes, antelopes, ostriche, and the wild. Very beautiful! The only drawback is the road to get there is very messed up with deep holes in them that make you feel like your vehicle will tip",
          "This tour took about 3 hours and could have taken longer. We saw herds of zebra, water buffalo, a hippo in a pool of water (but he wouldn't come out), giraffes (they were beautiful and so graceful), ostrich, and lions. The lions were most interesting as they were just",
          "Great smallish Park, close to city, so very accessible. Saw a variety of wildlife in the early morning. Not as many as in larger parks in different areas, but excellent taster for short visits. We were in Nairobi for only 2 days. Lucky enough to see rhino and its young one.",
          "A great way to have a 'quick' Safari as it was amazing the amount of animals we saw in a short time. First we saw lions with their cubs, then a Hippo, Giraffes, Cape Buffalo, Rhino, Warthogs, Crocodiles, many birds, a lot of antelope, Zebra and many other wildlife! Weird as you",
          "We went to the safari today we spend a few hours. It was great we saw many animals such as lions, hippos, bufflows, corcodiles, zebras, giraffes and many more. My main recommendation do not go in a sedan or van go in a safari car like the one in the picture. You want be able to",
          "This was such a cool experience. We saw all of the animals we were excited to see but what was great about it was how close it was to our hotel. We were able to fit so much in our day because we didn't have to travel far for the safari. My suggestion is to be patient, keep",
          "If you are in Nairobi, this is a must. I don\u2019t think anyone should go to Nairobi without visiting the park if they have the time. I enjoyed it so much, I went twice as I had the time available. There are many tour operators that do tours of the park. I went with Safarilinks and",
          "It is hard to believe that this type of safari is available in the city of Nairobi! We had an amazing encounter with seven lions that walked from several hundred yards out to within 5 feet of our 15 passenger bus. What a treat! We were able to spot Rhinos, Giraffes, warthogs,",
          "It was quite convenient, and there were quite a few animals, up close. This is the only place on this trip (which included the Masai Mara, the Serengeti, and the ngorogor crater where we saw a rhino up close. The lions were so accustomed to the Land Cruisers that they just",
          "If you don't have enough time to go on Safari or if you do but you are looking for something to do in Nairobi this place is great to start your adventure. You can see almost all the animals you will see during your safari in Masai Mara but in a few hours. Close to the city and",
          "Our driver and guide were very good and knowledgeable. You can see many animals in the city park, specially if you do not have time to go to Masai Mara.",
          "Had Daniel as a driver for my 1st visit. He is highly knowledgeable especially with the birds \ud83d\ude04, made my crew feel very comfortable and it was easy to talk to him and ask questions. Best Driver and guide ever. Also love the fact that we got to see the sunrise in time as we",
          "we loved being taken around this national park! so contained and we saw so many animals... all within cooeee of Nairobi city! the highlight was seeing lions devouring their kill of a giraffe.",
          "This was very cool...until we went to Masai Mara. It's nice experience if you are in Nairobi, but you will not get very close to the animals, nor are there very many to see. It takes a lot of driving around to spot them. Also, beware of the rough roads. Our daughter got carsick",
          "We went for a day trip with the whole family and the kids really enjoyed themselves. We were able to see most of the animals including giraffes, lions, zebras, antelopes and many more. It was amazing to be able to see all these animals in the wild yet in a park within a city!The",
          "Spent a great afternoon riding through his park to see animals, incredible landscapes. Saw lions, giraffes, various birds, hippos, zebras, & antelopes of many varieties. Many of the animals were unafraid of the vehicles, so you could see them up close vice from a distance.",
          "We did a day trip here just to get a feel of a park within a city although after visiting this park also visited several Kenyan parks. If you have the option to visit other Kenyan parks then i would recommend skipping this one but if your time in Nairobi, Kenya is limited then",
          "The first animal I saw entering this park was a Rhino! So much diverse wildlife, all packed into a park with a city skyline in the backdrop - amazing! Really, really enjoyed this safari - actually more so than some of the others that I spent 4 hours driving to to be honest. This",
          "You can almost touch the city, but if you look into the savanna of NNP, it feels as if you are a thousand miles away from it. The park teems wirh animals, lions, zebra, giraffe, antiope, crocodile and birds show their beauty without hesitation. A must go!",
          "A great activity if you are in Nairobi and wanting to see some animals, right in the heart of the city.",
          "A great place to see the four of the big five in close proximity of Nairobi! Seeing the lions was highlight to my day, but got great shots of zebra, white rhinos, and giraffes too to share.",
          "Don\u2019t expect to find a total full of animals but still you can find some lions, different gazelle, zebras and so. There are warthogs which BTW you can see them all over as well. We saw some Hippos but missed he Rhinos. Over all nice",
          "Be sure to get there early. I went with friends who showed up an hour late and you could tell how much harder it was to see lots of animals, especially lions, because we weren't in the park at sunrise.",
          "Ok... it's not a zoo so that's good. $50 per person is way over the top for what it is. Resident rate is about $5. There should be a fair entrance fee to actually encourage visitors but apparently all Kenyan national parks have adopted the 10x resident's price for foreigners",
          "The park is vast and offers a variety of paths to drive on. Best to start very early in the morning - we were there at 6 am and the crowd was growing as we waited to pay for entrance. Book a Land Rover with open roof for a good vantage point. We had a sedan vehicle so the view",
          "We went here very early because the animals are active only early morning and evenings. There are relatively few animals in the park due to its small size.For example, no elephants, because they need more space. However we enjoyed the drive and the rough ride. The an broke down",
          "There are few wild animals to see in the park. We went there before the safari and had a great time. If we had gone after the safari, it would have been a big letdown after seeing thousands of wild animals.",
          "The best place to spot lions with downtown background. Has some nice picnic sites. Best to go there before it warms up during the day.",
          "This park is very very close to the city, you can even see some animals from the bypass to Karen nowadays! It has many animals, you can see pretty much everything except elephants. If you are brave enough, come in early and get a proper driver and roof open car, you'll",
          "We did an early morning drive (leaving at 6am) to the NP and found it to be a piece of tranquil heaven near the centre of the city (which is utterly bizarre). We saw very few other vehicles yet plenty of sightings (lion & black & white rhino a highlight) as we drove round the",
          "This park is so close to the city. It has many animals that don't even care you are looking at them. Up close we saw water buffalo, zebra, ostrich, heart beast, lion, giraffe, warthog. Definitely my favorite close excursion in Nairobi.",
          "If you expect it\u2019s an open zoo for you to drive around. I am afraid that would disappoint you. I have been to few safari park in other countries which are just like the open zoo. Basically you must see all the animals they state in the brochure. But for this one, it\u2019s just",
          "We had a private safari for the day through this park. Was a lot of fun and saw lots of amazing animals. The drive from our hotel and back was torture, though -- horrible traffic in this city.",
          "This is my second trip to Nairobi but my first trip to the Nairobi National Park. We were surprised and thrilled at the beauty of the Park, the variety of birds and animals because it is surrounded by such a large metropolitan area. The variety of birds was fantastic. We saw 5",
          "The park has many animals to see. Only a short distance from the city center. I would advice you book the tour with a reputable tour company.",
          "Nairobi National Park is one of the unique parks in the world as its in the middle of this ever-hustling and bustling city. If you are planning a visit the best time is to go is early morning 5.30am and if you are lucky you can get to see a pride of lions, zebra, crocs, buffalo,",
          "Granted, Nairobi National Park is not the Masai Mara, however, if you're unable to get to the more distant national parks in Kenya, this will give you some experience of Safari. In an afternoon, we saw all four of the \"big 5\" animals that are present in the park (no elephants",
          "It was incredible! Saw every animal we wanted to see and more!! Spent the morning and afternoon there. Had lunch within the park!",
          "Even if you only have a morning or late afternoon in Nairobi, make arrangements for a 'safari' through the Nairobi National Park. You have the opportunity to see all sorts of African savannah/plains wildlife -- both predators and prey -- impala, gazelle, warthog, wildebeest,",
          "You can hardly believe this place is virtually surrounded by a major metropolitan area. A wonderful introduction to Africa's animals",
          "Organised a half day tour here, starting in the morning. The national park is quite small, therefore half a day is plenty of time. It has most of the main animal sightings available in other safari locations apart from elephants. The major draw here is its location so close to",
          "Seeing the African animals in their own environment as opposed to a zoo is something worth experiencing while in Nairobi. And this National Park is as good a place as any to experience a wildlife safari.",
          "I opted for an afternoon tour through the park fully understanding the I may not see some the resting animals. Nevertheless, apart from many small game and birds, we also came across water buffaloes, rhino's and hippos. The icing on the cake was when two lioness walked up to and",
          "Worth a look. Other parks offered more variety but was a good day overall. Saw some of the big five but not all.",
          "kenya bush expeditions tours and travel booked an early morning tour to this park. Its only 30 minutes from the Airport and many animals to see here. The rare black and white rhinocerous are well seen in this park. If you have free time, visit this park ,",
          "Every time that I visit Nairobi, I schedule a visit to this park. I start at 6:00am when it opens and stay until it closes. Be sure to bring snacks and drinks: there are no concessions available. Be sure to hire a reputable guide to shuttle you through the park.",
          "Amazing African Jungle safari experience inside the City , It is the only national park inside the city . The property offers you a close view of Lions , Rhino, Giraffe, Water Buffalo, Ostriches etc....",
          "This place is in heart of the Nairobi city and good for visitors looking for a day out. You can do the safari with either your car or with hired cars. Enjoy the safari with its self directed paths. You can also visit the animal orphanage inside the campus.",
          "For a small park, we saw a lot of animals! We really enjoyed driving around and stopping to enjoy the animals.",
          "Kenya bush expeditions tours and travel organized my afternoon tour to the park. Its such an amazing place to spend the afternoon with animals. Animals are moving freely and for birds lovers, there are plenty of ostrichs and crane birds to See!",
          "The roads are rough but hey it is a national park and it is in Kenya. There are no Elephants in the park they were removed because of conflict with humans. Don't be disappointed make sure that you book with a credible operator who knows the park and has intel from rangers. I",
          "I was expecting this visit to Nairobi National Park given I visited Nakuru parl a couple of years ago. The intention was to see mainly the Lions. They are supposed to open the ticket office at six so you can get in the park at 6:30. I don't know why they opened at 6:30 so we get",
          "We were in Nairobi for business but had the weekend free so a group of friends and I went on an excursion in the park. We were not disappointed - saw a couple female lions sauntering down the road and then in the grasslands scouting for prey. Saw a lovely variety of other",
          "Ok. This could've been a great experience if we'd done the safari I think. We just did the animal orphanage. It's $22 each and is just a tiny zoo with crappy cages. Then you have to pay again to do the 2nd part, the safari walk. I'd recommend just planning the full safari drive",
          "We say many wonderful big and small animals and birds. Joseph knows them all and gives wonderful details.",
          "You see lions, zebras, giraffes and ostrich up close. The animals are quite indifferent to your presence and were near the vehicles tracks allowing a good view and photography.",
          "If you don't have time to make it to the Masi Mara, this is the next best thing. Its basically the bridge between the wild and a zoo. It takes a little while to get your head around the fact you're watching lions, rhino's, etc to the back drop of city sky scrapers, but the",
          "Located in the capital city of Kenya.Has all animals except the elephant.You will.see.even the Lions roaming freely and the rhinos. I highly recommend if you have time in Nairobi.",
          "We had an amazing drive with our local guide Patrick through the park. The number and variety of animals we saw was incredible. Get there early and dont forget your camera!!",
          "Must hire a good vehicle fit for safari and a very good skilled and knowledgable driver. I was advised to visit the site early morning but that was not possible for me. So I reached there at about 10 am.Spent alomost 4 hours and ultimately got out of the park at 3 pm. My friends",
          "This wonderful national park, situated on the outskirts of Nairobi, is a must visit when visiting the Kenyan capital. It is small enough to visit in a few hours and yet large enough to house a very large number and type of animals. There are lions by the dozen, zebras,",
          "Did a 2-3 hour afternoon safari. Spotted many animals, including lion, ostriches, gazelles, eland, hartebeest, and zebras. Some of the roads are quite rough, so be prepared for bumpy ride. Was raining the day I visited, which I think made animals a little less active. It is",
          "I visited Masai Mara in 2015 and Nairobi National park in 2019. I think comparing both is like comparing apples with oranges. You will be able to see Zebras, Giraffe, Ostriches, Hippos, Rhinos in national park but not elephants, no leopard, no panther. And lions only if you are",
          "We spent a full day in Nairobi visiting all the sites, including a three hour game drive through Nairobi National Park in the afternoon! We saw so much - including a black rhino - and all with the city scape as a back drop! It was a great experience and very accessible.",
          "It's the coolest thing ever, a game park right in the heart of the city! I found it refreshing to at least interact with a different kind of 'city-dwellers' the kind that walk on four legs, does not pollute the environment and reminds you that there is more to life than slaving",
          "Prety dissapointing. So much walking around for absolutely nothing. I was very dissapointed. I recall visiting there in the past and it was very educative. All gone...",
          "Amazing Sunday in the park with the family. Saw lots of wildlife, lions and rhino were most special.",
          "i booked a tour through Kenya bush expeditions tours and travel and was in the park early enough to see the wonder it had. Lions were roaming frilly and the park many buffaloes, few rhinoceros. If you love birds, cranes and ostrich are there to see. All in all, i recommend",
          "Nairobi National Park was the first National Park established in Kenya in 1946, located about 7 kilometers south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Nairobi's skyscrapers are seen from the",
          "To have this on the doorstep of Nairobi is so doable in an overnight stay, a morning or afternoon drive round the park and the views back towards Nairobi were stunning, lots of animals to see and my children found it a great adventure and not a huge cost on me and not too far to",
          "Loved it - back again soon! Need to get there a little earlier next time, it was too late in the day/too warm to see the lions. We did see everything else though!!",
          "Even if you only have a few hours in Nairobi, this is a must. The range of animals and birds we saw was incredible but it is also worth it for the wonderful cityscape on the horizon.",
          "Since the park is fenced you will not find elephants but you have a good chance to see leopards, lions and all the other amazing animals of East Africa. The park is small and can get crowded with safari cars so try to go very early in the morning.",
          "As the NNP is not that big it is perfect when you stay in Nairobi and like to spend some hours in African nature. But be sure to have an experienced driver with a special car like the Defender with an open roof. We booked with Hilton and it has been simply perfect: Only we two",
          "Great game park, fairly expensive to get in as you have to pay for your driver as well but it was worth it. We saw 2 lionesses with 3 cubs, two more lionesses an hour later and a male lion sunbathing by the side of the road an hour after that ! [ Didnt see another lion in lots",
          "I was surprised to see sooo many animals! We had a lucky day and had the chance to meet the lions. It was beautiful... so much! I didn't appreciate seeing other cars all the way but apart from this I really liked it. Note: ake a coat to go there, I was freeezing!",
          "We headed here as a taster before heasing to Mara and Amboseli. This national park provided more variety than the other reserves put together. We saw everything but cats and elephants on our 2 hour drive around.",
          "This is an awesome place to see and capture wild life without having to travel outside of the City center of Nairobi. We were able to see Zebras, Lions, Hippo, Water buffalo, Giraffe, etc.. Go early as when that sun comes up it can get HOT!!!!!",
          "It is a must see for tourists visiting Kenya. You may not be guaranteed seeing much animals but have seen zebras there.",
          "A unique park, litterelly within the city, then extending for miles and miles towards the mountains. Highest chance to see animals. I just wished there were less pickups (only agencies are allowed) and much cleaner, not to mention I wished they stayed well distant (currently",
          "Enjoyable from start to finish, our guide's level of knowledge was fascinating. Service was wonderful and lots of animals to see. Great to see the conservation efforts being made here.",
          "I visited the Nairobi National Park, located in the middle of the city. I saw Zebras, Impalas, Warthogs and Buffalos. I wonder how long the city Reserve will last. You can see commercial projects in the horizon. But, there's something achingly beautiful and grounding about",
          "NNP is juat 15km from Nairobi city centre and has an amazing array of wild animals from Lions to Dung Beetles. The only thing missing from the 'BIG 5' is the Elephant. The park, whilst big, just isn't big enough to support a herd of Elephants. Please be warned, this is no zoo!!",
          "I was booked an afternoon tour by Kenya bush expeditions tours and travel. The park is okay with many animals. i was able to see lions, rhinoceros, buffaloes among many other animals. Go here if you are bored with the city!",
          "We arrived to Nairobi and booked a tour to the park for an afternoon drive. We planned to visit the park as part of the first two days we arrived in Nairobi as we adjusted from the time change. It was perfect because it was easily accessible from the city, but felt a million",
          "We got up at the crack of dawn to get here and it was so worth it. Can't believe how many animals we got to see on our game drive early in the morning!. A lion that was still feasting on a buffalo and trying to keep a pack of hyenas way from his breakfast, a hippo submerged in",
          "We went for many game drives and was able to see 4 out of the big 5, an amazing experience. They have guards in the park to make sure there are no poachers around and they search the cars for safe stay. Loved every second there",
          "I was extremely surprised to find out how large this Park was with it being so close to town! I had a fantastic time in the Park. I saw so many animals I had to quit counting! There were zebras, giraffe, lions as well as so many different birds! I even saw a rhino!!",
          "One of my best Sunday mornings in Nairobi, was catching the sunrise in The Nairobi National Park. Get there as early as 5.30am, check yourself in etc and head straight to Impala Point to watch an epic sunrise over the entire park, and then start your drive. You're good to",
          "Although the just two service counters were working so the entrance payment queue was long everything else was beyond perfect.",
          "The national park is great if only staying in Nairobi and want the wildlife experience. However the size of the park is limited and as a consequence so is the experience. Visitors who have visited or intend to visit the more extensive parks are unlikely to gain anything",
          "Titus was our guide exceptional man. He made the trip more memorable finding remote areas to see game. We saw giraffes lions water buffalo ostrich zebras rhinos and hippos. Must do activity",
          "This park is just amazing. A national park with wildlife right in the city. I love to switch off and drive into the park for pleasure and peace. You will see rhino, ostrich, antelope, crocodile, lions if lucky many other wildlife. Just need like 3 -4 hours of your day to enjoy",
          "This park is somewhat iconic in that the skyline of the city forms the backdrop to the wild animals that call the park home. On this occasion we were staying at Emakoko for two nights and were able to go on five self drive game drives during our stay. During those drives we saw",
          "You're in Nairobi and wondering whether to do this? Well, yes. Pencil in a day for all the reasons discussed elsewhere. Be at the gate when it opens. Bring warm clothing... it can be cool in the morning. Use a tour guide service with a proper vehicle. They're equipped with",
          "For me , Nairobi National park it was a very good idea to try the experience of safari because I couldn\u2019t go to Massai Mara with my baby . But it was very nice time with safari at the gate of city , we are going later at morning , we saw giraf , zebra , buffalos , .",
          "i was booked by Kenya bush expeditions tours and travel for an early morning tour. The national park is wonderful only a few miles from the city center. Its such an amazing park to visit when on a kenyan holiday,",
          "Give yourself 4-5 hours in the park... you\u2019ll definitely see water buffaloes, antelopes, zebras and giraffes... lions and rhinos are hard to spot but depends on your luck. Apparently there are 30 lions in the park. Roads are a bit rocky at parts. Well worth the visit.",
          "At Nairobi National park you are able to see a great number of animals at a close range. I enjoyed the Orphanage since I was able to witness the animals being fed... It was an awesome experience. It is not as vast as Nairobi Safari Walk. Both gives an unforgatable experience.",
          "Living just 20 minutes from the Park, we are regular visitors. Best to be there for 6am opening, to see early movement of the animals, and the sun rise. Always something new to see, and easily spend at least 7 hours in the park.",
          "Very good place near the city, we saw many animals and was nice. The entry process is a bit slow and seems untechnified (could do online payments or let the tour operators handle it for faster entry) for such an important place, and the entrance is a bit expensive for",
          "what a great place to visit just in the outskirts of Nairobi! we went on an early morning visit using a local guide. Th detour cost about \u00a360 plus the entrance fee to the park. It was well worth it! I didn't expect to see so many animals! The tour guide, Alex, was brilliant! A",
          "We drove throughout the Nairobi National Park in the late afternoon for two and a half hours. It was amazing to see zebras, antelope, giraffes, buffalo, guinea fowls so near but the most exciting part was noticing hyenas eating a buffalo. After seeing this we wondered where a",
          "Seen the big cats so close to the city! Seen lots of other animals too! City skyline so close to the wild is an awesome experience, clean with some paved roads was a nice change after some of the other national parks. Nice day trip if that is what you are looking for,",
          "Our tour was arranged by Kenya bush expeditions tours and travel early in the morning. The park is quite interesting with a lot of animals to see . We were able to see lions, buffalo, rhinoceros, ostrich and many more. It is quite a good park to visit.",
          "the best thing about the park is that it is so close to the city, and you can take a taxi for the ride-which can save money, many different animals",
          "We didn't have time this trip to leave Nairobi for an 'out' safari experience in Kenya. I signed up for a Park safari and it was incredible. We were picked up promptly at 6 AM and joined a family group of three. We were in the park by 7 AM and off on our adventure peering out",
          "It was amazing to see lions ambush zebras at the watering hole. The photos we got were amazing. I was very impressed at the diversity of animals within the park.",
          "We have visited most of the national parks in kenya like,maasai Mara, Amboseli both Tsavo East and west and they are all good.However would highly recommend a visit to Nairobi park for short time or layover visitors and also to those planning other safaris to have a taste of",
          "We spent a full day here and it was beautiful place for wildlife we saw a big heard of Rhino it was really nice",
          "You need a tour operator or a really sturdy 4-wheel-drive to navigate the badly rutted dirt roads, but a visit will always pay dividends. It is amazing to foreign visitors that such a wonderful park is so easy to visit, but this is just a taste of what is available in the magic",
          "I booked a tour to the park recently. Was able to spot many animals including lions at close range. Thanks for great park within the city!",
          "We spent 1 night here in the Tented Camp and did two safaris. The main reason to go on Safari here and not elsewhere is to see Rhino. Both Black and White Rhinos were easily spotted by our traveling companions the day before our arrival. However, on our two safaris we only",
          "During my visit of Vastu and Architecture design I visited this place. I felt the nature was there to greet me. Enjoyed the company of animals. They are animals they don't harm without purpose.",
          "Excellent place to see the wildlife however see it before the Kenyan politicians destroy it and trust me they will",
          "I take my groups to Nairobi National Park before we fly out to the Masai Mara. While Nairobi National Park is \"safari light\" compared to the Masai Mara, it is a great park to go to before the main attraction of the Masai Mara. It gives us a chance to get some photography",
          "The national park is a real blessing for transit visitors. you don't need to go far to visit a park. It is situated in the heart of Nairobi. the tour guide Alex from safarilinks took me on late afternoon safari. I saw most animals except hyenas that comes at night... Pride",
          "I went here prior to beginning an East African overland tour and saw almost all of the animals that I had hoped to see during my entire holiday. Lions, rhinos, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, baboons, warthogs, antelope, buffalo, etc. The juxtaposition of the animals against the",
          "So easy to visit and a lot to see on one day tour. No elephants as the foliage won't support their eating needs",
          "The giraffes are very friendly. Its a place you cannot satisfy staying. We had a lot of fun especially feeding them. A must visit while in nairobi",
          "I booked a tour through Kenya bush expeditions tours in the afternoon. the park is perfect and was able to see lions, my favorite. I really like cats and the park tour was worthy visiting.",
          "Great tour with a wonderful guide. Got to see a lot of animals up close including Rhinos, Antelopes, Buffaloes, Ostriches, monkeys, giraffes, lions & zebras.The guide was excellent, using his many years experience to take us into all areas of the park. The open top made our",
          "I was a little skeptical as I had heard mixed reviews about the national park. I was there early and wasn't expecting to see a great deal. I had a fabulous day. Saw black and white rhino, lions - even a pride hunting, zebras, buffalo, and giraffes. Amazing time and would",
          "The park is well arranged. Entry and fee cilities is good. I do not recomend using the East gate, since the road leading to it is very bad. There are quite a lot of large animals, and the drivers do get very close to the animals. Being so close to the city, the park is very",
          "Be there early to experience a proper game drive. If you\u2019re lucky, you can see the lions hunt in the morning. Pay attention to the weather. Was extremely chilly early morning around that time of the year (May). Plenty to animals to see - Lions, deer, buffalo, giraffe, rhino and",
          "Where in the world can you take photos of animals against a city skyline. I reviewed this park after a visit in 2016 and still stand by the \"hit and miss\" nature of seeing animals. However we have since been to the Kingfisher picnic spot a few times on a Sunday - it is an",
          "This place is a gem. Some people consider it nothing more than a wild city zoo, but I found it to be quite special. It's a great escape from the city and an excellent introduction to the wildlife of East Africa if you are on your way to other parks.",
          "I spent a few hours here. I saw pretty much every animal except a male lion and hippo. It is dry season so I would suggest going when the water levels are higher and more animals are out and about. I haven't been to any other parks so I can't compare it but it was overall a",

          "Having visited other Kenyan parks i would say there isn't much to see here as there are bushes and tall grass spotting lions or other carnivores is virtually impossible. If you have time constraints then you could visit this place but i would definitely recommend other Kenyan",
          "We have been before so knew what to expect, sadly there were fewer animals and the rains hadn\u2019t yet come so the land was dry and it was hot. But we had a fabulous time driving around the park, you need to be aware of the bumpy roads so not really for young children or the",

          "It is very large, it consists of 900 hectare, it is left as pure nature for the endangered animals to live without any danger. We saw the lion, zebra, antilope, ostrich & many more.",
          "Wanted to visit Nairobi National Park as I understood there was a good possibility of viewing rhinos there. We were very fortunate in that we saw lots of rhinos on our first morning game drive. We saw white and black rhinos and even a group of six or so rhinos together. Very",
          "it is nice but even with 4*4 some roads are a challenge ;p but verry nice for a day trip. lots to see",
          "We visited Nairobi NP after our 3day trip to Masai Mara. After seeing the vast track of land with lots of animals around in Masai, you would be a little disappointed with Nairobi NP. We were lucky though to see rhinos here as we were not lucky enough to find them in Masai.",
          "Beautiful park. Saw lions, hippos, hyrax, giraffe, rhino, gazelles, zebra, and much more! Travel Beyond thought to send us here upon arrival in Kenya! Great first stop! #travelbeyondinc #travelbeyond",
          "Nairobi National park is literally within sight of the city - and it's teeming with wildlife. Herds of herbivores, flocks of birds, and quite a few lions make the visit worthwhile. Sadly the government felt the need to build a railorad smack in the middle - I can only hope",
          "It is the only known national park in the city in the world. In this beautiful park in the city, you will be able to see giraffes, zebras, lions, antelopes, baboons among other animals. It is located just a few kilometers from the city and it will only take you approximately 20",
          "Yes, and a fantastic example to the world of the importance in protecting that which is most important - our wildlife ecosystems. even if you only have half a day in Nairobi, spend it in the park. Hire Isaac as your guide from Southern Cross Safaris and his keen knowledge and",
          "If you are in Kenya on business and have no time for a safari you can spare 3hrs and do an early morning in the Nairobi National park. You will be lucky to catch all the wild animals especially the Big five apart from the elephant.",
          "My son and I spend a day with a guide here and had a wonderful time. Lots of wildlife and very convenient if you are staying in Nairobi and don't have time to spend a few days in the bush.",
          "Took a provit tour for half day; very handy worth while visit to see Lions Zebra and natrually habited animals Only complain i have is that all driving is on the unpaved road for 2-3 hours.",
          "The park within a city is a great place for quick safari. The roads are well maintained and the size of the park means that if you come early you can virtually cover all of it including those paths that lead to nowhere that we adventurous people like to explore :) If you get",
          "Lions hunting, Many Buffalo, Rhinos, not bad in just over 2 hours. If you are busy and short of time but have a morning to kill, this is a great choice. The traffic jams that occur when a lion is spotted is interesting from a people watching perspective",
          "Great park. Many animals. Huge number of impalas. Where are the lions? They say that there are less and less lions because they have been poisoned by neighboring farmers because they ate their cows. I am not well informed about why and how but hope that there are predators",
          "Went here in the dawn of fire and smelled the wilderness all the way from way back the mountains. I would even love this place with blindfold. It\u2019s a treat coming here and Jesus the great did tell us. I am in a position to love this place. Love this place again. And I would love",
          "The variety of animals is amazing. We had so much fun on our half day visit. A must-do if you have about 3-4 extra hours in Nairobi.",
          "Nairobi National park is probably the best national park with this close proximity to the city. It would take you 30 minutes to get there from downtown. A $45 enterance fee let's you in and then you can explore the entire place. It is recommended to take a guide as they know",
          "We were advised to get here as early as possible (arrived for 7 am) so that we saw the animals when they are most active. During the hotter part of the day they will be less active. We didn\u2019t have to drive far before we saw antelopes and giraffes. During our drive through",
          "So many people talk this place down for all the wrong reasons! It\u2019s simply fantastic. You can see Lions, Hyeanas, Giraffe, Buffalo, Black Rhino Leopard and so much more. With 60 percent of the park enclosed animals still have migortory rights into the east and the KWS rangers",
          "This national park has definitely gotten so many reviews and it's actually earned its plaudits. It happens to be the only national park in a capital city and here you get a chance to see lions roaming freely in the wild. In this park, you will also see lots of buffaloes and",
          "Our guide drove us through the park starting at 6:00am and we saw so many animals including Buffalo, Impalas, Warthogs, Gazelles, Giraffes, Lions, and White Rhinos. We were very lucky this day!",
          "It was such an experience to see animals in their natural habitat instead of a zoo. I could have spent days in this park.",
          "It is almost surreal to have such an impressive national park abutting onto the city of Nairobi. If you are a serious birder or just want to see many mammals and different habitats, this place is a must for those staying in and around Nairobi.",
          "We were collected from our hotel at 6am and after the short trip we had to buy entrance tickets,which were about 1,300 KES from memory And as we were very lucky with sighting of animals during our visit,proved to be superb value. Strong recommendation to have the opportunity",
          "The park lies on the outskirts of Nairobi. You can rent a car with a guide at the gate, but it is wise to reserve these. It is a very beautiful park, bursting with beautiful animals. We came for the rhino and we saw the black and white. The only big drawback is the new car",
          "Horrendous lines at payment desks at main gate. Took over an hour. Great park but we were exhausted even before entering the park.",
          "From the pick up to the drop off it was a wonderful experience. I recommend this for anyone not able to take a true safari during their time in Kenya.",
          "Good during for exploration. very friendly and helpful staff. It's good for both kids and adults. Want to see various wild animals, then this is the place to find them.",
          "We hired a private driver for the day and got dropped off at the airport later in the afternoon. The park is indeed a gem in the middle of the city. we saw quite a good number of game, including a mating pair of lions ( collared of course) on the side of the road.",
          "Great place to visit when in Nairobi and you dont have much time to do much else. It may be small on the map but it is very expansive. However, the railway being built on the northern end of the park may destroy this beautiful gem of a park",
          "We had a great visit. Worth it to hire a driver for a day as they are very informative and very experienced in finding all the animals that you want to see. Bring snacks and water and enjoy the show. They only accept credit cards so come prepared!",
          "Watching wildlife within the city centre was awesome. The proximity of the park makes many people desire to tour the National Park. Well managed, the employees are super.",
          "so many beautiful creatures we should. be supporting these countries that are stable to help maintain these creatures the wild. our world will be a sorrier place without them",
          "We had a great time here. Might have been better with a tour guide because the trails are confusing sometime though they were well labelled. Go very early to buy tickets. The animals disappear as it gets warmer. We were there by 530am. They open at 6am. Got to see zebras,",
          "Have been to the national park zoo on several occasions. Kids really enjoy it, there\u2019s lots of open space if you plan on chilling out on the grass. Pricing for locals or residents is very attractive.",
          "The very first safari we did was to Nairobi National Park. It's a great half day adventure if you're looking for something to do. A lot of animals live there except for elephants. We saw so many animals up close including lions, zebras, giraffes, rhinos etc. It was a great way",
          "It's totally mind-blowing to experience \"wild Africa' with lions, baboons, rhinos, zebra, gazelles and more with the skyscrapers of Nairobi on the near horizon! Plus the new railway line snaking through the eastern part of the park! Avoid the picnic site near the Athi River",
          "This national park is very close to the Nairobi city center and it is indeed an affordable way to go on a safari for less money. All the big fives are not there, but still it is a nice game drive to do. I was here in the morning time to catch a glimpse of the lions, but they",
          "We went with OAT, so had a very informative guide and excellent driver. Saw all types of animals and birds. Giraffes with young, white rhinos with a baby too, all sorts. Pictures worth thousand words. Traveling in January it was not crowded at all! Great visibility!",
          "Game drive and Safari walk. Great to see the animals and every staff member was professional and nice.",
          "Getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city without breaking the bank and having to go so far away,a few minutes from the city center and you are lost in the quietness and tranquility of the park,with a good guide you can almost catch the lions,the drive itself is",
          "This park is direct in Nairobi town, so it is for everybody, who will land in Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta International airport and wonts to see Africa nature and animals. Entry fees are good and the visitors have three possibilities, how to send the time... classical safari, safari",
          "Excellent game drive with driver Benson in the National Park. Seen a lot of different animals up close. A truly beautiful park with a driver who knows where to find the different animals.",
          "Nairobi National Park is the only game park in the world which is so close to the city. You can visit for a day or half-day or even some hours, the beauty of the park will never disappoint you. All the game is there, except elephants. Excellent photo opportunities with the",
          "I felt so good visiting the national Park where I was able to see different wildlife. The lions, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, baboons etc. I actually had a touch of nature. Nice landscaping, nice restaurants within and good reception by the staff at f the park. Just go have fun.",
          "I think a lot of visitors to Kenya fly in and out of Nairobi without giving this national park a second thought. I spent a day here and saw elephant, rhino, cheetah, buffalo, baboons, antelope and I could go on! It makes a great day out whilst in Nairobi",
          "We didn't have a lot of time to spend at the park but in the short time we were there we saw SO many animals. The park Is HUGE and the fact that it is in the middle of a 5 million person city is incredible. It was an amazing experience.",
          "If you are short on time, but still want to see lots of animals and beautiful vistas, this park is an excellent half day outing. It is conveniently located within Nairobi and offers surreal views of the modern city skyline as a backdrop to Zebras, Giraffes, and other wildlife",
          "It\u2019s really neat to see this park on the outskirts of a large city. We went into a small part of this park when we went to the elephant wildlife trust. We saw a family of baboons. Mom, dad and 2 kids. We also saw buffalo while driving its edge from the airport. A great option",
          "We drove through the park in December 2018 and saw lots of animals. Got there @6am and the animals were out and about. Best time to go. The kids had a great time seeing all the different animals and taking pics. Go early for the best experience. Going with a guide would be best",
          "It\u2019s a great national park with a restaurant inside called Sebastian corner. Typical, flavored and warmer staff where u can live away from city centre a special night. Fore leg with a delicious taste, and.. do not leave the restaurant without trying \u201cmukimo\u201d , kind of. A smash",
          "Nairobi National Park is a good place for bird watching since I was there mainly for the birds.It is also a good place wildlife viewing with a variety of wildlife.I saw hippos,giraffes,black and white rhinos,jackals,zebras,antelope,ostrich and buffalo, .I must say that the most",
          "Close to Nairobi and it's interesting to see the animals with the skyline in the background. If the is your only chance to take a safari, you will enjoy it. However, compared to the other parks in Kenya, ie Masai Mara, it does not have the density of wildlife and you have to",
          "If you\u2019ve guessed right the worm here are the lions in the park and we weren\u2019t the early bird. Began at 700 am and then due to delay in organizing logistics of payment through mpesa (make sure you carry your card, I didn\u2019t) we went in around 8am. Saw a lot of giraffes and",
          "Good viewing of lions, hippos and rhinos in addition to deers, giraffe, zebra and even ostrich. If you are short of time and can't visit Masai Mara, Nairobi National Park is a good option owing to it's proximity to the city. It doesn't have elephants though... Readiness tip:",
          "We saw some animals like bufallo, Zebra, rhino, warthogs, gazelles , we didnt get to see the lions though, the whole ride took 3 hours.",
          "Stay at Ololo if you can, but definitely go to the park if you aren\u2019t having a full Safari. We saw Rhino and Giraffe and lions, and it\u2019s all really accessible and an easy visit from the city. The landscape isn\u2019t stunning but at certain points it\u2019s pretty spectacular when you",
          "Wildlife Sanctuary next to Nairobi airport. Can see when you come into land. Still a lot of wildlife. perfect for a transit visit.",
          "Took my girls to see the animals. The guard at the gate was really helpful. The place is well coordinated and it was great spending time at the park. My children were really happy. It is affordable.",
          "I tried the self drive but rarely encountered any wild animals. Got in late morning so maybe missed the flow of animals in their early search for food. Better hire a driver with their vehicle and make use of their experience in spotting and radioing where wild animals are.",
          "This park provides a wonderful space for a short safari to see all sorts of animals in a wild setting. Albeit the park is increasingly isolated and harder for migrating animals to reach. The Standard Gauge Railway stretches across the park on a bridge/stilts which takes some",
          "We had a great morning today ,our day stared out with a beautiful sunrise on the way to the Nairobi National park. We seen so many animals today, even the Lions came out this morning. Alexa our guide was great very informative. Recommend if you have day in Nairobi.",
          "I would recommend it if it\u2019s your first game drive but otherwise I found that the animals were very few and all very far. Still nice scenery with Nairobi city in background",
          "Nairobi national park is the place you will never want to miss. Fortunately i saw lion and other animals however its all depends upon the luck and timing .",
          "A don't miss attraction. Amazing variety of wild animals in this park with the unique proximity to Nairobi. We saw many Rhino here and very close!",
          "A full day at Nairobi city would not be complete without a game drive to Nairobi National Park and Starboard Safaris made sure I got to see 3 of the Big Five here",
          "Well if you start this city safari early in the morning you wont be disappointed, The park is huge and within the city which is amazing in itself, in 4 hours or so We saw almost all the animals there (apart from the black rhinos) and even saw a hunt chase of lioness herd against",
          "Went for late afternoon organized drive with our group on an open vehicle. Did a long loop around the western half of the park. The park has a variety of habitats, from forest to open grassland and nice waterholes. Saw a range of game up close - rhino, giraffe, zebra, eland,",
          "Despite the SGR dominating the landscape and destroying my favourite picnic spot (Mbuni) the park is still a place of peace and relaxation in stark contrast to the ever growing city. it is even more important for people and animals now as a haven from the stress of daily life.",
          "Take a tour of this park if you don\u2019t have the time or resources to go on a safari. You will see, up close, many of the interesting species, and the drive through the park itself is mostly quite beautiful. You will see the skyline of Nairobi from some parts of the park, and,",
          "Lovely safari in the city which cost about $50 per person. Got to see most of the animals including lion. Just see place in Nairobi.",
          "The Park is unique as it is the only known national park in the world located right at the heart of a city. The most exciting part of the visit is the animal orphanage section. To see any animals in the park, early morning and evening is best.",
          "A must do if only to get out of the city and away from the annoying and intimidating men constantly approaching you for money. This haven of a park is sure to suprise and delight. I was fortunate enough to have a personal guide who was happy to take me where I wanted rather",
          "Going in search of a wonderful mood, freeing up your mind it's all happens in Nairobi National park... With the wild animals watching them they just lifts mood from 0 to 100 that quick... Girrafes,elephants i just got a long story to narrate about the park",
          "We saw much game easily only a very short distance from the city . Notable were white and ( amazingly the rare ) black rhino , lions , martial eagle and much much more . A visit is highly recommended albeit not cheap for non Kenyans",
          "Last year we drove 5 hours each way to Masai Mara Park. It was a good trip. But, save the 10 hours on the road and go to Nairobi National Park and see many of the animals and stay in Nairobi. Arrive early or stay late, your choice. Well worth the visit, even could go several",
          "So I visited Nairobi National Park with my well informed friend and our 2 year old kids. We did a half day safari. We did gamedrive and saw birdlife too. We saw lions. Wildbeast and giraffes. Our kids enjoyed too.",
          "Being in the heart of the beautiful Nairobi City,, it is within the reach to everyone within the city and similarly other visitors from elsewhere. The place is very natural, very tended to with very humble and experienced tour guides. Can't stop remember the place even only for",
          "Nairobi National Park our best adventure visit of the year. The wildlife, the environment very gorgeous, hilarious.",
          "Being born and raised in Kenya, I think we have grown up seeing these animals on TV where people from foreign countries come to enjoy what we have. We need to go out and enjoy what our country has to offer. These places are beautiful and the nature is serene. Mark your calendar,",
          "Extremely underrated park! I saw 4 white rhinos, 5 black, lions (including cubs), gazelles, buffalo, zebras, giraffes, antelopes, ostriches, and a TON of birds in a 3 hours drive in the park. Highly recommend it. You can stay at the Emakoko if you plan to spend the night, great",
          "I rented a minivan with my office colleague for the visit. It was very expensive for two people (ksh 14,000) but totally worth the experience. The van was open from the top. Its the best way to see the park. I saw all animals - lions (12 of them planning a hunt!), Impala,",
          "If you are in Nairobi and you do not know what to do, will you should group some pepople, negotiate with a tour operatori the price (try to fill the van, you will get good rate), and head to the Park. I paied 100$. It is just out of the business district, buffalos giraffes and",
          "We stayed at The Emakoko... which is a safari-type hotel/lodge that is located inside the park... thus you automatically get game drives anytime you drive to/from the lodge. There are many animals in the park - more than we were expecting... and more than we thought would be",
          "I was on business with a morning to spare and thought why not. I paid extra for a single open top vehicle but what a delight. We were at the park at 6am and on the track soon after, it is too small for Elephants so no big 5 but what an experience to see Giraffe, Zebra, Water",
          "Had a mandatory national park trip during my business trip in Nairobi. Didn't enjoy and actually we saw more animals after driving out in the highway. For me waste of money and time. Kenyans are very proud of national park. They will definitely recommend this to you.",
          "Nice park with friendly staff. Close to the city. Only rescued animals. Staff is walking around in the park ready to support you.",
          "This park is a great way of spending the day or to wind down after a long day of travel to Nairobi. While it is no Masai Mara, surprisingly, there are some aspects of this park that the Mara doesn't have.",
          "I had 2 days in Nairobi before moving on to the Mara and decided to visit Nairobi National Park. I was skeptical at first, but boy am I glad that I did it. I had a van all to myself and within minutes after passing through the gate, we saw rhino, giraffes, lions, buffalo,",
          "Lions, zebra, white rhino, impala, antelope, hippo.....this places has them all and more and easily accessible from anywhere in Nairobi",
          "It was an interesting place to visit. I have been to Nairobi a lot of times but never thought of visiting. If one is short of time and have little time, the Nairobi National Park is a great place to see. One can see giraffes, antelopes, buffalo, lions, zebra.... A nice place",
          "Narobi National Park is an inspired piece of planning. To have managed to retain this open space for a wildlife park so close to the city is genius. We had a great visit and saw lion, zebra, giraffe, rhino, impala, hartebeest and a variety of birds. I love the photos where you",
          "It is such a pleasure to have a National park only at barely 5 km from home. Our Sundays are better when we decide to wake up very early and make a day safari. Lots of animals and specially some of the most beautiful birds in Kenya. This is a fant\u00e1stic plan for long stays in",
          "Spent several days at Nairobi National Park and enjoyed it immensely. We saw amazing animals and even had a Cheetah sit on the road a few meters in front of our vehicle. What a treat!",
          "Literally just a half hour drive from downtown Nairobi this is a wonderful park to visit for about 6 hours or so..you can see Lion and plenty of Giraffe and rhino as well.",
          "Visited the park and spotted 3 of the big 5 of Africa namely Lion, Rhino and Buffalo. Wasnt expecting to see a lion but was fortunate to see the king of the jungle although we reached inside at 8am. Must see place when in Nairobi as this is the only National Park in the world",
          "Loved getting to see animals in the wild. They had many animals out. Get there early. That seems to be the best time to see them before the heat of the day hits and they all nap or go in the shade.",
          "If people don't have time to go the main game parks this is a great opportunity to experience safari. Keep 5 hours total starting from hotel and returning back and you will be able to see most of the park. Should leave around 5 45 am to visit the park. Early morning can see",
          "Somewhat disappointed, did not see many animals. The adjoining elephant orphanage center and the giraffe center were very enjoyable",
          "It was worth going here we went early morning so the animals were active and weather was so gloomy we saw all big 5. It\u2019s better to go early and you will enjoy a lot. In just 15 min of our drive we saw Lioness just in front of us. We were so lucky..",
          "This park is located near the airport in Nairobi. This will just give you a basic feel of the great safaris that you will do later in other bigger game parks. Fee to enter for foreigners is around 43USD. You drive in and you will see a wide variety of animals, like lions, Rhino,",
          "An extensive tour of the Park and great to see all the animals. Unfortunately didn\u2019t get to observe lions as they probably were having an afternoon nap. Otherwise can fully recommend for anyone having a half day stop in Nairobi.",
          "Park some lunch, 6 pack or two of your favourite beer (Heineken), bottle of wine, some water and then put some fuel in your car. That's all you need to enjoy this park. Spent the day on a self guided tour with my family trying to spot some wild animals. Was lucky to tick off 4",
          "Wow what can I say, driver from my hotel took myself and 3 others from the hotel around the National Park. We saw a huge amount if animals, giraffe, zebra, buffalo, 9 rhinos, a sunbathing crocodile, gazelles, antelopes, warthog, monkeys and the best was a Male lion. At first",
          "Great experience for the kids. It was fun all round. Put on your snickers \ud83d\ude0e A variety of animals to see....",
          "Jammed this in on a work trip and so glad that I sacrificed the sleep to make it happen. Hire a driver for the morning and go for it. Top tips - 1. Don\u2019t sleep in - hit it as early as you can. The animals do early. 2. Hook up a van with a massive open roof - ours was",
          "This was my first Safari Park trip and my first trip to this great continent. I have mixed feelings for this visit: - I got there a bit late ( 11 am) and everyone said its too late to see all the animals - The additional charges were unexpected ($45 per person) plus $ 80 for",
          "Was really unsure what to expect with a safari being in a city! But this blew my expectations, it was amazing. I got there later than planned and that was at 6.30am, there was no queue and literally just made paid, please remember they do not accept cash, card only. I saw",
          "Excellent park with many animals. At first i thought it had less animals, but when i bought a tour, it turned out to be the perfect choice. My game drives were done by Kenya bush expeditions tours and travel early in the morning. It park worthy its credentials.",
          "the big five and much more, you can drive your own car and go where you want, there is a forest part with old trees which is amazing for Africa because they cut all the trees if not protected, we got lost trying to find the way out, a very big park, full nature and next to city",
          "If you cannot make it to Masai Mara or one of Kenya's other parks then this park is the solution. You can see Lions here though you need some luck.",
          "Excellent place to see animals and learn about conservation! This is a beautiful place with exciting experiences around every corner! Spend sometime here and enjoy yourself!",
          "We booked via Kenya Bush Expeditions tours and travel for an early morning game drives. The park has all the animals worth seeing. Name them lions, buffalos, Rhinocerous, Zebras among others. Book a tour to this park if you have time in Nairobi",
          "Bordering the city this is the perfect day trip. You will see a nice landscape and plenty of game. No Elephants since the park is fenced .. If you are lucky you might even see a Leopard",
          "In Kenya with no time for a multi-day safari. No worries, the national park is right there, and with only a half day to spend I felt like I got the real safari experience without any of the travel hassles. Catch on with a guide or bring your own car and guide, both work, and you",
          "Not too big so you can see most of the wild life animals There are no elephants We were lucky to see the lion with two puppies walking slowly down the road",
          "At 0600 only 10 minutes from Crowne Plaza Hotel and most central Nairobi hotels......apparently only city in the world with a national park in its limits. You can use your own car but professional tour guide and safari type vehicle with viewing roof definitely better. Even if",
          "A group of nine of us travelling together visited Nairobi National Park on 15th September 2018 at about 1600 hours. The park is only 7 km from the city centre. With its easy access this is an opportunity for visitors to Nairobi to enjoy the experience of a safari. The park is",
          "The Nairobi National Park is the only place you can see the Big 5 except the Elephant in there natural habitat on Weekdays early in the morning. Traffic is lighter and best time to see lions is early in the morning, but be aware that roads in the park are extremely muddy, and it",
          "We arrived very late (11h)and most animals were hidden. well that is what we were told by the guide. So do go in the morning 6 am! This is very much in the city so you do see the buildings in the background. If you live in the city it is nice to get away. otherwise take some",

          "The concept of the park is amazing. It is a huge reserve of wild animals, 10 or 15 min by car from the city center, and you can use your own car!!! just make sure you have a all road car and that you have some kind of navigation and communication, not depending on the signal",
          "This park had excellent wildlife and plenty of it. The wildlife consisted of, White Rhino, Giraffe, Blacked-back Jackal. It was different seeing the wildlife against the back drop of sky scrappers. It is situated very close to the town of Nairobi so it is great for a half day",

          "If you have the opportunity to visit a proper game park while in Kenya, I\u2019d recommend you skip this park entirely. If you really don\u2019t have the time, then make sure you go with a proper vehicle and safari guide rather than taking your own vehicle and guiding yourself. It\u2019s",

        "wiki": "Giraffe Manor is a small hotel in the Lang'ata suburb of Nairobi, Kenya which, together with its associated Giraffe Centre, serves as a home to a number of endangered Rothschild's giraffes, and operates a breeding programme to reintroduce breeding pairs back into the wild to secure the future of the subspecies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Manor was modelled on a Scottish hunting lodge, and was constructed in 1932 by Sir David Duncan, a member of the Mackintosh family, of Mackintosh's Toffee fame, originally sitting on 150 acres (61 ha) of land running down to the Mbagathi River, the southern boundary of the city of Nairobi. In the 1960s, the Manor was purchased by a local investor who leased it to a succession of people, including the late Dennis Lakin, before it fell into disrepair, unoccupied.\nIn 1974, the Manor was purchased by Betty Leslie-Melville and her husband Jock, along with 15 acres (6.1 ha) of the original 150 acres (0.61 km2). Since then, a further 60 acres (24 ha) of those have also been purchased, which along with an additional 40 acres (16 ha) gifted by Peter Beard which used to form part of his \"Hog Ranch\" has brought the total acreage of the Manor up to 115 acres (47 ha).\n\n\n== Life as a giraffe sanctuary ==\n\nShortly after purchasing the Manor, the Leslie-Melvilles learned that the only remaining Rothschild giraffes in Kenya were in danger due to a compulsory purchase by the Kenyan government of an 18,000-acre (73 km2) privately owned ranch at Soy, near Eldoret, which was the Rothschilds' sole habitat in Kenya. Inevitably, the government's purchase would result in the land being sub-divided into smallholdings, and the giraffe being slaughtered.Since the Manor was already home to three wild bull giraffes (nicknamed Tom, Dick and Harry), the Leslie-Melvilles agreed to rehome one of the giraffe, an 8-foot-tall (2.4 m), 450-pound baby they named Daisy, about whom Betty subsequently wrote the book \"Raising Daisy Rothschild\", later turned into the film, The Last Giraffe.Daisy was soon joined by another baby giraffe, Marlon (named after Marlon Brando), and since then the Manor, in conjunction with locations such as Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire, England, has run a breeding programme to reintroduce the Rothschild giraffe into the wild to expand the gene pool. Part of the land of the Manor is given over to the Giraffe Centre, run by the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, a charitable organisation set up by the Leslie Melvilles and Betty's daughter in 1972. By tradition, the giraffe themselves are named after individuals who have contributed significantly (whether financially or otherwise) to the work of AFEW, such as Lynn, named for author and journalist Lynn Sherr, a giraffe devotee who wrote an entire book devoted to the creature.\n\n\n== Life as a hotel ==\nIn 1983, Rick Anderson (Betty's son) and his wife moved onto the \"Giraffe Manor Hotel\" property to take over management of Giraffe Manor as a small, private hotel where guests could feed the giraffe from their breakfast table, through the front door, and out of their 2nd story bedroom window. The Manor has twelve bedrooms, one of which is furnished with the belongings of famous writer Karen Blixen (aka Isak Dinesen).\nOver the years, the Manor has welcomed guests such as Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Ellie Goulding, Naomi Watts, Eddie Vedder and Walter Cronkite (after whom one of the Manor's resident warthogs was named), Johnny Carson, Brooke Shields and Richard Chamberlain, as well as hosting Richard Branson, Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman on the launch of Virgin Atlantic's London\u2013Nairobi service in 2007.In March 2009, Giraffe Manor was purchased by Mikey and Tanya Carr-Hartley. It's part of The Safari Collection group of lodges and hotels, and includes the Sasaab lodge in Samburu County which pays a rent of $58 per guest per night to the local Samburu people who owns the land. The manor and Sasaab were portrayed in a BBC TV documentary.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLeslie-Melville, Betty; Leslie-Melville, Jock (1979). Raising Daisy Rothschild.

          "Giraffe Centre is a great place to take young children to interact with wild animals. Upon entering, one of the staff members will provide you with some foods in which you can feed the giraffes. I took my 10mos. old baby and even he enjoyed the Giraffes. This is a great place",
          "Amazing place to be close to Giraffe, feed and kiss the giraffes. but not too close as the giraffes are also naughty to knock you by their heads. Compare to the costy Giraffe manor, here is the best place to visit giraffes.",
          "I highly recommend visiting the Giraffe Center. I went right after visiting the baby elephants which is what most people do and it wasn't overly crowded. For the price you pay, you get a good amount of food to feed the giraffes which allows you to take as many pictures",
          "Great experience, but isn't somewhere you stay long at. Kind of feels like you go and feed the giraffes, have them eat the food out of your mouth, take some pictures and visit is over Saying that, really glad that we went! There were quite a few people trying to feed them so",

          "Another learning experience! Staff were friendly and infirmative. The giraffes eat out of your hand. Our driver put a pellet between his lips and the giraffe took it from him! It looked like the giraffe was kissing Peter...",
          "This place makes you smile! From th emoent you walk in you are in giraffe heaven. You receive a half coconut shell of pellets to feed the giraffes and they will take from your hand or mouth, even directly from your bowl if you're not paying attention! You can feed them from",
          "This attraction was so much fun! We got to feed and pet the giraffes, enjoy the educational center, see across the field to the historic Giraffe Manor and spend as much time with the animals as we wished.",
          "We all enjoyed feeding the giraffes, what long tongues they have! Also getting so close to them is a very special treat!",
          "I went here with my sister and a Kenyan friend in March, just before Covid-19 became a global pandemic. The food was good and so were the curio's. Enjoyed feeding the giraffes. When we went back to our residence about half an hour away, I realised I had lost my phone and the",
          "Well worth visiting when in Nairobi, open all day with large elevated area for viewing, Giraffes come up very close to be fed and are used to humans.",
          "Well, it's not often that I get to feed a giraffe out of my hand! To be so close to such graceful animals is unforgettable. The knowledge of the presenters and the success in preserving the Rothschild Giraffe is to be applauded. What an exciting and unforgettable experience!",
          "The Giraffe centre was a lovely experience. You get the chance to get right up next to the giraffes and feed them (feed is limited to one portion per visitor per visit and is included in the admission price). They are marvellous animals and I am really pleased I had this",
          "After hearing much of giraffe center,i decided to take my family to Kenya and the first place was giraffe center. My kids had so much fun and it made our whole experience on the entire Safari worth it.",
          "Was a lot of fun to feed the giraffes! I only wish the staff were more proactive in warning you about giraffes and head butting. I was a victim of one giraffe's headbutt and had a headache for a day. Otherwise, it's fun to interact and support the work of the Giraffe Centre.",
          "This was fun. Giraffes are free to roam but will come to you for food. The center provides food for the giraffes. Quite an experience.",
          "This is the only place you're likely to see the Rothschild giraffe. You get to feed the giraffes by hand and they are very friendly. The staff also give you quite an insight into giraffes and explain the different breeds of giraffe and how they exist in the wild.",
          "Can be a busy place and a bit overcrowded on weekends, but the experience was very informative and it was fun to be that close to the giraffes. You can escape the crowds and learn even more by visiting the trails directly adjacent to the center. There's also a couple of",
          "This place has a nice concept but isn't all that fun to visit. Basically you're waiting with several others for your turn to feed the giraffes a few pellets and get a snap while you're at it. The giraffes are very cute but also not interested in being patted or anything, just in",
          "If you are in Nairobi you MUST stop at giraffe manor! Not only is their mission fantastic to help breed the rare Rothschild giraffes but they do onsite education and you get to feed/interact with the giraffes. Just a small fee to enter and you get a bowl fo pellets to feed the",
          "You cant get any closer to the giraffes as this. To be able touch and feed them is wonderful. The center is educational and unique experience.",
          "Made a quick stop here to feed the giraffes. Fun, up close and so cute. Great stop for kids and adults.",
          "The Giraffe Manor looks (from pix) lovely but at > $1K/night you might want to skip staying there and instead visit the ATTACHED Giraffe Center. You won't be able to sit and sip coffee with the giraffes in the early morning nor sip tea in the late afternoon but between 10-3 the",
          "The giraffes are very cute, but the vibe here is interesting. The centre is full of package tourists trying to get good Instagram photos, so people can be a little pushy when it gets busy. Which is fine, but it does bring into question the true approach to conservation here,",
          "It was incredible to get close up to these amazing gentle giants. They are so beautiful and being able to feed them and see their long purple tongues was quite an experience. The staff are nice and very helpful and love to answer questions. I would suggest going earlier",
          "$15 credit card only. Good for a short visit. It's not a huge place, but you get to feed giraffes, so it was awesome. Plus, these are the same giraffes that visit Giraffe Manor (where you pay thousands).",
          "At this centre one gets to interact very closely with giraffes by feeding them off one's hand or even mouth! It is an exhilarating experience and one of those unique encounters one has in life. You will appreciate nature's diversity.",
          "The Giraffe Centre and the staff answered all the questions we had, and they go to great lengths to guide visitors and educate them about how giraffes live and are integrated back into wildlife. It is clear that the staff take great care of the giraffes, which is heartwarming.",
          "The giraffe sanctuary is tourist friendly while still being able to have a cultural experience. Local workers can tell you about the giraffes and why they're there. All the giraffes do have their own personalities which makes meeting and feeding them fun and dynamic.",
          "Amazing place to visit, to get up so close and personal with these beautiful creatures is such an amazing experience. The animals are very well looked after and it\u2019s a great setup there. Great way to spend a few hours.",
          "It was a very intense, shocking, but awesome experience to try feeding the Giraffe using your mouth to hand in the food. Geez! I went there twice... one in January and the other one in February 2020. The same awesome and exciting experience.",
          "If you have some few hours in Nairobi make a point of visiting the Giraffe Centre. I was able to feed the giraffes pellets very up close. It was so interesting and worth the visit. I highly recommend the place.",
          "We really enjoyed the experience of feeding the giraffes and learning from the team working there. They are very well cared and they are doing great job helping them to recover back their wild life back. Residents have special price like 3-4\u20ac. Non residents is like 10-13\u20ac.",
          "Getting to be able to hand-feed Rothschild's giraffes was one of the best experiences of my life. I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd ever have such close contact with these majestic animals! And our guide, Elvis, was VERY informed and personable.",
          "Nice and educational. The staff members where informative and helpful. We arrived early morning and had the center almost all by our selves the first hour, we feed the giraffes pellets and I took it up on me to be the official giraffekisser that day. A smal souvenir shop in the",
          "it is a small place, but worth the drive. it is like a round balcony same height as giraffe. you get a bowl of giraffe food that you can feed the giraffe, in case you are ok with having giraffe saliva licking your hand. I personally skipped this part :)",
          "A superb place to get in touch with the giraffes, meet these lovely creatures and spend time getting to know them. I loved the feeling of their tongues as they licked the pellets from my fingers. Great fun.",
          "Loved the free flow and experience of feeding the giraffes up close. My nephew had a fantastic time. also the various levels provide awesome picture perspectives.",
          "I have lived in Nairobi forever and this was my first time visiting this attraction hidden in the Karen suburb which I grew up in. Double miss on my part. It's a nice place to go for an outing with family to enjoy the wildlife and feed the animals. However it would be good if",
          "Excellent visit at the giraffe Centre, the kids where very happy to feed the giraffes. It will take you from 30 mn to 1 hour to visit this place, but it worth it.",
          "We were given a cup of food to feed the giraffes and that was really fun as there were two young giraffes. I heard from another traveler that when they came the day before they had the two adult giraffes to feed and that the female whacked the tourist on the back of her head",
          "We visited the Giraffe Centre after visiting the Elephant Orphanage as they are reasonably close together. At first I thought, ok, for the entrance fee they give you some compressed food bits and you can feed the few giraffe that stand and wait to be fed. But on the veranda, a",
          "Not been here for 25 years and it was as enjoyable as ever. Quite expensive really for what is bound to be a fairly short visit.",
          "The giraffe center is a must see in Nairobi. You get to spend time with the giraffes and actually feed them. It\u2019s really a lot of fun. Highly recommend!",
          "The Giraffe Centre is a totally interactive experience with giraffes. The guides are very knowledgeable and can answer all your questions about the resident giraffes as well as the conservation program. Food pellets are available (no extra charge) for feeding to the giraffes.",
          "So fun to see the giraffes that close, feed them and take pictures with them. It worth the visit. We went on a Sunday morning around noon and it was not very crowded",
          "Want a close up encounter with a huge giraffe... You have to come here... What a great place. These guys are doing a great job... Its an experience that you will not forget.",
          "Giraffe center is the best sanctuary for the rare Rothschild giraffe. Giraffe Center is a breeding, research, and conservation center where you can learn about Rothschild giraffes and get the opportunity to feed giraffes.",
          "I had an amazing time visiting the giraffe centre and I will definitely recommend it to each and every nature lover.",
          "We visited the Giraffe center in December 2019. It was really crowded but a great experience to see the giraffes up close and to feed them",
          "Great experience getting up close to these magnificent animals. We had a great tour having kisses and cuddles with the giraffes",
          "The centre has giraffe that you can hand feed which a joy in itself. There is a restaurant and gift shop available and free parking. The best time to visit is when the centre opens, since there are fewer people there then.",
          "Full disclosure: Giraffes are my favorite animal, so that probably influenced how much I enjoyed this experience. We visited in the afternoon, and stayed for around 1 hour, 45 minutes. This amount of time is probably longer than needed, but it did afford me the opportunity to",
          "this gives you an unique opportunity to reach the head of the tallest animal on the savanne. You are able to feed them by hand and acquire information on the magnificat animals.",
          "I absolutely loved visiting the Giraffe Centre in Nairobi. It's not a zoo, rather, a place where Giraffes freely come and go which made the experience much better. There are lots of visitor of course, so I'd recommend taking your time when visiting the Giraffe Centre - If",
          "Whilst the beautiful Giraffe Manor was out of our price range we were still able to meet the famous Betty and lots of other giraffes. Cheeky young Lilly being our favourite. Kissing a giraffe is not something you can do every day and an absolute must!",
          "It was a lovely experience at the giraffe Centre, everything was orderly. The staff and guides on site were friendly and ready to share their knowledge on the giraffes there. If you have children they'll tell one to be cautious with a specific giraffe who isn't a fan of young",
          "At this place you have the opportunity to feed the Rothschild Giraffes. You can get up close and the staff at this place are very helpful in telling you how to feed the animals. Went there around 12 noon, after visiting the elephant orphanage nearby. It is a good idea to leave",
          "Great opportunity to get up and personal with giraffes. We were disappointed not to learn anything about giraffe from the staff that were milling about.",
          "The giraffe's are huge and exude calm, unlike the scores of tourists throwing vegetarian pellets in their mouths. There were shady places to sit and avoid the crowds. We took advantage of them.",
          "Worth getting there early, as the giraffe are hungry and more interested in seeing what you have for them. You recieve a small shell of pellets, and the beautiful creatures gently stick out their tongues to take one at a time, or lick out the bowl if you give them the chance.",
          "We spent almost an hour at the Giraffe Center with our two children, ages 8 and 10. You are given a cup of food when you arrive but if you need more you can just go ask. Another surprising note - I had the best espresso in Nairobi at their cafe :)",
          "I visited on the recommendation of friends. The centre was smaller than expected but very informative. Ensure that you go to the talk behind the information boards on the first floor. The giraffes were the best part of the visit closely followed by the smiles of the visiting",
          "This chance to get really close to these beautiful animals is delightful You are given some food pellets to feed the giraffes who take them gently on their long blue tongues. Beautiful.",
          "Amazing place, lovely feeding the giraffes, the staff was helpful with taking photos and the top hut-kind-of museum was amazing. Loved the animals and reasonable prices",
          "We weren\u2019t sure what to expect when we got to the Giraffe Centre as it was quite small but we were really surprised with the interaction we had with the giraffes. They are so graceful when they walk towards you but there\u2019s nothing to worry about. You are given a bag of food for",
          "It was an unique experience of touching ,feedings and feelings giraffes,I would suggest everyone to have same experience that as a did with those beautiful creatures at least once in a lifetime.",
          "A nice place to visit in Nairobi for a short trip, can be very close to giraffes and feeding them. Children would love and have fun here, but be careful the giraffes are greedy when there are food in your hand!",
          "The giraffes are great to watch. I didn't like the feeding business. Visitors come, feed the giraffes and leave. 1500 KES for non-residents is heavily overpriced. The David Sheldrick's elephant orphanage has 500 KES for all visitors. At the Caf\u00e9, I had to wait more than half an",
          "I visited the Giraffe Centre and really had a great time. You get to feed the giraffes up close which is very interesting.",
          "Apon entering, you receive a coconut shell filled with pellets to feed the giraffes. These are endangered Rothschild Giraffes that live on many protected acres. It's fun feeding them - their long tongues are quite sticky! This is a popular Nairobi attraction and is quite crowded.",
          "The giraffe centre is a nice site for a brief visit. The experience of feeding the tall & graceful creatures is interesting. Each giraffe has a distinct personality so that adds to the mix.",
          "A great place to bring the kids for an hour. The grounds are well kept, but this is just a quick photo op. You can can also grab some coffee and snacks. This is a skippable experience unless you really like feeding giraffes.",
          "If you are in a very tight schedule (even a single night) in Nairobi, you should still try to put this on your itinerary. Remember, watching Giraffes in Safari jeep and watching them here, up and close, it's a different experience all together . From Nairobi central,this can",
          "This is a fantastic place to spend the afternoon. The setting is beautiful and is great to get so close to these wonderful giraffes. We at lunch here too which was tasty and cheap. Lovely gift shop on site too, lots to purchase!!",
          "Having visited several times, the Giraffe Centre is well-worth a visit if in Nairobi. Feeding the giraffes at such close proximity is a rare and enjoyable experience and provides an excellent opportunity for photographs, and the centre staff will enthusiastically share their",
          "The Giraffe Center was so awesome. I got a chance to feed the giraffes food. There long tongues are sticky. So cool to experience, you gotta go.",
          "We stoped in for a quick visit to see the giraffes. We were able to get a bowl of food and feed the giraffes from a balcony. It was very cool to see them up close and to be able to feed them. This is for sure a must do if you are traveling in Nairobi.",
          "It\u2019s a great place to feed the giraffes and get up close. It doesn\u2019t take much time since the giraffes are literally feet from the entrance.",
          "Visited with a group of colleagues from six different countries. The place was a total joy for all of us! We arrived later in the afternoon which meant queues were a lot shorter than on a previous visit. Everyone really enjoyed the visit.",
          "This is the best place to see and feed Giraffes! they are so beautiful and most of them very gentle. One of them is a bit of a bad girl and will try to headbutt you :-) All part of the fun... you get a good look at them and the big eyes, the very long purple tongue the tuffs on",
          "Giraffe Center is a unique opportunity to interact physically with the silent giants. Do you know that some Giraffe species are endangered? While visiting Nairobi, take your kids there, feeding them, seeing them at a few centimeters, it is an unforgettable experience. It is a",
          "Definitely a must see while in Nairobi. Entrance fee for foreigners/non residents of 15 dollars is well worth it and make sure you have your visa card ready. Cash payments are not accepted. I fed and patted giraffes for probably an hour, took numerous photos and didn't want to",
          "It\u2019s an awesome experience giving you a close interaction with the giraffes. The guides too were so helpful.",
          "We took in this wonderful place during a morning sightseeing trip in Nairobi as part of our safari tour. We were first through the gates and got a great view of the various sized Giraffes lumbering across the open land to recieve there treats. You can feed them from the ground",
          "We had a good time at this center for Rothschild Giraffes. We were able to feed them treats and it provided some fun. It would be especially entertaining for children. We had a guide for the 2 of us, which meant we had preferential treatment. And we also learned a lot about the",
          "We had a good time visiting Giraffe Center and most of all being able to touch them, but once we had spent time watching the Giraffe I found there was not much else to do so limit to 1 hour max.",
          "At this place you can feed the Giraffe yourself from the feeds given to you..a good photo opportunity",
          "You get to fee the giraffes very close to you, Just watch out if you stop feeding, it may head butt you. I never though I would be that close to such a large animal.",
          "It is beautiful and a blessing for me and fellow Kenyans to experience the beauty of our wildlife and country. I loved feeding the giraffes and spending my day with them.",
          "We have been to Giraffes Manor in Nairobi Kenya. First of all they tickets prices are nearly 4 times higher for non Kenyan citizens. Which I didn't like. Overall 7 to 8 Giraffes were there. You can feed Giraffes was something nice experience. It takes maximum 45 minutes to",
          "Feed these majestic creatures pellets from your hand or, if you dare, from your mouth! A Giraffe kiss :-) A truly memorial experience.",
          "Easy ticketing / entry process, However note you'll pay a higher price if you are not a local. The interaction with the giraffes was amazing!!! Loved every bit of it! There's a couple of curio shops on the property which are reasonably priced.",
          "A lovely place in Nairobi to see giraffes up close and personal. Visitors get to feed them pellets as well. Lovely animals.",
          "You get to feed them with your hand, giraffes will take it with their long tongues. The price is fine and you can get a student discount",
          "An important part of conservation, in my mind, is finding ways for the public to experience the magnificence of these animals in a safe and appropriate way. The Giraffe Centre provides visitors of all ages an opportunity to hand-feed the giraffes. You will never get closer to a",
          "I visited the Giraffe centre, whose objectives are to protect endangered Rothschild giraffes. You are given a bowl containing pellets to hand feed giraffes from the balcony at the first floor of a small building. But after, you have nothing to do\u2026 The people who are here do not",
          "This is certainly a MUST VISIT centre when in Nairobi .. you also get to feed the giraffes (no extra cost)",
          "Although I understand that this is a conservation and breeding program, standing on a platform and feeding the giraffes smacks to much of a zoo to me. Seemed very artificial and commercial and some of the animals are kept for many, many years and not released.",
          "Very enjoyable you can feed giraffe and the attendants are very knowledgeable. They gave us lot of information. Its open whole day so no rush",
          "A really fun experience! Got kissed by my first giraffe! Nice staff and worth the $$. Would visit again!",
          "Cost for two foreigners is 30 USD. You each get a bowl of pellets and then you feed giraffes. There was some interesting information about the animals aimed at kids and other conservation info. There is a nature trail which we did not go on as it had been a long day. So, if",
          "Get a close up view of the giraffes here and the opportunity to feed them. While it is a fun activity, there really isn't a lot to do once you fed the giraffes - personally I preferred Nairobi National Park where you get to see many more animals",
          "It is amazing to see these wonderful animals so close and have a chance to feed them. There are two viewing levels. Wow. So much fun! The cost was $40 dollars/pp when we were there. Take all the pictures you want. Scour the bin were the left overs are for more kibble. You'll",
          "You get to feed the giraffes. It is a lovely center with a lot of information about the different types of giraffes.",
          "Being able to feed the giraffes will go down as one of the most unique and special experiences from my time in Nairobi, Kenya. Not only did I get the chance to feed the giraffes I also learned quite a bit about them during the lecture. It was very informative and never boring.",
          "This popular tourist site is usually followed by a visit to the Elephant Orphanage nearby. It is a fun place to go and see the giraffes close up, feed them by hand (or by way of your mouth). It offers an interesting story and demonstration inside as well. The admission fee is",
          "As the name species, this place is all about giraffe. Moment you enter and take a ticket. People area where you enter immediately introduces you to these giant and beautiful creature. Ticket is 400 shilling for local and 1500 shilling for non residents. Coffee shop, souvenir",
          "It is nice to be that closer to the wild girafe and to participate at their preservation. Advice : don't go just after the sheldrick one because everyone does that and you won't have a moment alone with the Girafe.",
          "I had planned this myself after reading reviews on it. Definitely worth a visit. A bit pricey for sure but you won't experience feeding giraffes and getting licked by them anywhere else. Very cute animals. Please don't abuse the giraffes. I saw tourists repeatedly putting",
          "We visited the Giraffe Centre as part of a day trip from Nairobi. I don't think you need a guide for this, if I were to do it again, I would just hire a driver for the day as the private tour (also including the elephant orphanage and a stop for lunch at the Karen Blixen",

          "This was fun, apart from giraffe feeding, and a coffee/gift shop there is nothing else to do there. I\u2019m pretty sure these are the same giraffes that live in Giraffe manor. Your given a small bucket with pellets, and if you ask staff there is one giraffe there who will give you a",
          "It was really lovely to interact with the giraffes - they are extremely beautiful animals and seemed very friendly (though it might have had something to do with the food we were offering). The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because they didn't have any information I",
          "Fun visiting and feeding the giraffes titbits. Amazing how tall they are! Well worth a visit especially with children.",
          "I really don\u2019t understand the point of this place. Feed some captive giraffes ... you can likely do this at most any zoo in the world. Overpriced and not recommended.",
          "I was disappointed not to secure a room at giraffe manor although when i realised that i could visit the giraffe centre for just $12 per person, i realised that i had saved myself a lot of money. The staff are very friendly and helpful and you have the chance to feed several",

          "Get up close and personal with these beauties! Feed them, get a giraffe smooch if you want! Such a wonderful opportunity to learn about the three main giraffe varieties and what is being done to protect them. It helped us to understand better when we did game drives later on",
          "This place is a great experience! Sure Giraffe Manor is a beautiful hotel you can see in the distance and the allure is feeding the giraffes. Welp these are the same giraffes and the whole experience is a fraction of the cost. They are a no cash operation so make sure you have",
          "First time being at Giraffe center. What beautiful animals! Affordable entrance fees for both residents and non residents, I had so much fun feeding the giraffes. They are so calm and graceful! Loved the whole experience.",
          "Another great place to spend a few hours in the close company of the majestic giraffe. There\u2019s a small museum, a high platform to get close and for a few shillings you can buy a bag of feed and they will gently take it from your hand. Top tip: if it\u2019s busy you\u2019ll find most",

          "The Giraffe centre, Nairobi is the most sought after attraction, especially by the kids however despite its comparatively high ticket for the non resident tourists there are quite less number of giraffes available. The place has been made restricted in area despite large free",
          "Giraffe centre is such a wonderful place to be.The environment is so clean and calm. THe best part is that you can so close to the giraffe and one is brave enough you can get a peck from one of them. I happened to giraffe Daisy. So adorable. You can't get enough of these",
          "I recommend doing this as part of an organised tour that includes the David Sheldrick Trust, Kazuri Bead Factory and Bomas of Kenya - all nearby and takes the hassle of working it all out yourself! I really loved it here, feeding the giraffes is fun, and you can just sit and",
          "I took the kids (16, 14 and 11) to check this place out. First of all. It's an hour's drive from where we live and the whole tour is basically a ten minute feeding activity. Guardians are super sweet and they would answer all questions happily, but there are so many people",
          "My highlight was feeding the giant giraffes. as you feed them, they will lick your hand and you can feel the rough texture of their tongues. There is a museum nearby where one can learn more about giraffes. Highly recommended. If you can, kindly combine a tour of the park, the",
          "Our trip to the giraffe centre was one of our best experiences in our visit to Kenya. The giraffes are fantastic and charming animals. Everyone who wants get the opportunity to feed the giraffes. Even though there is really not much more to it than to see, greet, feed and",

          "This was the best experience of my life. The giraffes were amazing and very photogenic. If you are visiting the giraffe centre: 1. Go with a friend so you can alternate between feeding and taking pics. 2. Go with a good camera. 3. Feed the giraffes 1 food pellet at a time to",
          "This was one of the best experiences I had in my two weeks in Africa \u2014 you get a baggie of feed and you feed it to the giraffes. They come right up to you on the balcony of a raised platform and will stay with you through photos and selfies so long as you\u2019re offering snacks! I",

          "If you want to get close to giraffe, hand feed them, support an important breeding programme and entertain yourself for an hour then this is a great place to visit in Nairobi. One of the educators onsite guided us around too which helped us understand the conservation work much",
          "This was an amazing experience for me. You get to get up close and personal with the giraffes and you are given a small bag of pellets to hand feed them. A park Ranger is available to answer any questions. The area is clean and you are able to meet and greet the Giraffes at",

          "It\u2019s been my life long dream to feed a giraffe, and I gotta do it here. It was an amazing experience. However, it was so busy it was a little overwhelming. They don\u2019t have a maximum number of people who can be there at once, so not too long to queue to get in, but it was rammed.",
          "I enjoyed feeding and watching theses graceful animals. Most importantly I loved hearing about the educational programs designed for local Kenyan children. As a gardener I loved thinking the children are growing trees for the Rothschild Giraffe and learning the importance of",
          "If you want to kiss a giraffe, this is the place. You get to feed the endangered Rothschilds giraffes who don\u2019t seem to be bothered by people with cameras, but love the tiny pellets provided. It is quite something to be so close to such a tall creature. Great fun and our guide",
          "Its a great place to visit when in Nairobi. Get close to the giraffes and feed them. It takes about an hour for the whole experience. Its worth the visit. Its a bit out of town in Karen. Some giraffes can head butt you if you get too close on their side so follow the",
          "If you have grown up on zoos like I have, the opportunity to get close to a giraffe \u2014 let alone feed it \u2014 is unthinkable. A small bag of giraffe snacks and advice to hold the nuggets between your thumb and forefinger comes with the price of admission. Most people I saw were",
          "I love visiting the giraffe centre - it's so good to be able to get close to the giraffe and feed them. The staff are knowledgeable and very helpful. The centre is a great place to take any visitor for a really unique experience. I've also enjoyed a guided walk in the forest",
          "Spent 2 hours here as was fascinated by the giraffes. Got to feed several giraffes and also attend a talk about the giraffes which was insightful. Giraffes were well looked after and some great photo opportunities too",
          "Truly an amazing experience and a must visit for everyone who visits Nairobi! Out guide gave us a private tour of the grounds and told us stories about the giraffes. He even made sure we got great pictures with them! The giraffes were so calm and interactive we were blown away.",
          "Had a very pleasant visit here. Got to feed the giraffe. Their tongues are very rough. Worth a visit.",
          "We stopped here as part of a tour package. If not included price is 15 USD payable in cash or card. Giraffes are both very calm and interactive",
          "A visit to the giraffe center is a must. What a fabulous experience! Such beautiful and gentle creatures, was simply amazing",
          "I really enjoyed feeding the Giraffes especially getting kisses from Kelly \ud83d\ude0a there was a guide whose name I cannot remember but I enjoyed the stories he told of the giraffes and although there was a group of people he still made time to answer my questions and engage with me.",
          "We've been to other Giraffe centers where you can feed and get close. But this one had the friendliest we've ever seen. Plus there were loads of them to feed, pet, and look eyeball to eyeball. You can get great pictures of them hanging over your shoulder to get at the food you",
          "We were staying at Giraffe Manor and decided to have a walk to the centre which we were glad we did. Our guide was very interesting and engaging to listen with a great knowledge of the Rothschild Giraffes and the programme at the centre.",
          "Without taking detracting from the mission of the Giraffe Centre, I'll start by saying I was spoiled for time and wildlife exposure in Kenya prior to visiting the Giraffe Centre. These factors, together with the cost of seeing a small number of giraffes in a contained",
          "Learned lots. The giraffe are so gentle as they take the pellets from your fingers. Will not let you pet them tho. Hahaha",
          "Whilst I\u2019m sure they have a good mission statement behind them this place left us a bit empty.. You walk in after having paid the entrance fee of KES1500 (approx \u00a312) and you get handed over some munchies for the giraffe which acts as roughage for them. The objective is good",
          "The place is tiny! Overcrowded with tourists all trying to feed the giraffes with the small bag of pellets you are given(you pay extra). They may do good conservation work but the centre isn't worth going to - go spend time in Nairobi National Park and see them in the wild. Not",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here after our visit to the elephant orphanage. Being able to be so close to the giraffes and feeding them was quite a treat, and we enjoyed learning about this species (Rothschild) of giraffes and the center's mission to care for and release these",
          "Don't miss seeing the giraffes up close! When you arrive, you are given a small bag of feed and the giraffes will come and eat out of your hand. There is a small lecture hall with lots of additional information. I loved seeing the long eyelashes on the giraffes!",
          "A must for anyone who loves wildlife. You get to feed these wonderful creatures and interact with them and learn more about them. Photo opportunities are amazing too!",
          "I spent around an hour at the giraffe centre, visiting as part of a group tour but it is really easy to get to yourself. You can feed the giraffes pellets or even receive a \u2018kiss\u2019 from a giraffe if you wish. There are also a number of warthogs at the centre. There is a talk",
          "A fun filled day with two excited children getting up and close to feed the giraffes. A wonderful and unique experience.",
          "If you love these majestic animals, you will enjoy the opportunity to see them up close as you feed them special pellets and feel their raspy tongues as they gently take the food. A wildlife specialist described three types of giraffes, how to tell them apart, and where they are",
          "Giraffe tongues tickle. What a great experience. And such important conservation work. Fortunately not as crowded as the Sheldrick Elephant sanctuary",
          "Great introduction to Rothschild giraffes. Easy access. Fairly inexpensive, especially when compared to the cost of staying at the Giraffe Manor and the grounds and the animals are the same. Feeding them from your hand is fun. Only need about 30 minutes or less here.",
          "I was beside myself being able to pat and feed these elegant creatures. I fell in love with Max whom I along with others fed from the upstairs platform. Stephen my guide from ecotours took lots of photos and was most accomodating. It was a most memorable experience would",
          "Great fun, especially for kids, but very crowded. Magnificent animals. We had a guide and still hard to find a place to feed the giraffe.",
          "We had a private guide take us here. We read a lot about this place and wanted to see it. A fun place to visit and it had a wonderful shop there where we bought some stuff - wish we had bought more!",
          "This was really nice because we could get so close to the giraffes and feed them One of the educators, Daniel, gave us a lot of information which made it even nicer.",
          "What a wonderful experience we had at our visit to the Giraffe Centre. Our educator was wonderful and very knowledgeable. We learned so much and had so much fun feeding the giraffe. We are so thankful that they are doing this work for the Rothchild giraffe. Amazing people and",
          "We came here hoping to see a more natural habitat but were met with over 100 travelers with selfie sticks trying to get pictures with the giraffes. Everyone was pushing and shoving one another to get a closer look and to feed them. We left drained and sad for the giraffes.",
          "Love the giraffes, it is a little pricey but you get to feed the giraffes. Combine this trip with a visit to the elephant orphanage.",
          "What an awesome experience - to be so close to these wonderful animals was breathtaking. They are more than happy to take the food offered - but so gentle. Loved it and it has to be a must when visiting Nairobi.",
          "The Girraffe Sanctury was amazing. You can feed the Girraffes a d the kissing g of the Girraffe was different experience. So visited the elephant orphanage. That was really cute watching them get fed with large milk bottles and you were quite close to them. Cheers Alexandra",
          "I came here for third time within a year and still found happy. STaying close to nature, feeding the innocent girraffes, give a lot of happiness to many people and seeing all of their expressions, it makes me happy as well.",
          "Go, you will love it! You feed giraffes, touch them, it is amazing. They have tons of them and they take care of them",
          "A great opportunity to feel the giraffe. You can feed them with the free feed they give. There is one packet of free feed along with the entrance ticket. They will come near you and if you put their feed near your face they will even lick it from your face. You can have a",
          "Where do i begin?? Giraffes are soo cute. This place lets you be up close and personal with them. Feed them, touch them and kiss them. We had a real great time when we went here.",
          "They are surely one of God\u2019s strangest creations. But absolutely fab up close. On entry every person is given a bag of food pellets that the giraffes will take straight from your hand or lips if you don\u2019t mind a giraffe kiss (no thanks).",
          "Our group got there when then opened at 9 AM (so the giraffes would be hungry). We fed them little pellets from our fingers and lips. We also got a talk inside a building; the person talking had just so-so English and was hard to understand.",
          "Not worth it at all. Very expensive to see at the end 3 giraffes to feed. Max stay 29 minutes... after that there is nothing else to do",
          "Up close and personal, these giraffes are graceful and just amazing! They have the biggest tongues ever\ud83d\ude00",
          "It was fun getting up close and personal. The giraffes would take their treat given to us right out of our mouths. What wonderful animals.",
          "Was a great experience overall. But way too many people. Very oversold. Felt much like a zoo. Though they do great rehab/breeding work at the facility. Our guide actually said \u201csometimes we have to mistreat them\u201d. I think something got lost in translation and he was trying to",
          "We visited in the early afternoon, and although there were plenty of people around it did not feel crowded. We were there for about 45 minutes and had plenty of chances to feed the giraffes. Little tour groups came and went, but there were never as many people as at the elephant",
          "This was a great place to begin our search for knowledge about the wildlife on the African Savannah in Kenya. We learned about the 3 kinds of giraffes in the country, but the concentration was on the Rothschild giraffes that are being encouraged to breed in the Giraffe Center.",
          "We enjoyed it! It can get really busy with visitors/ tourists as it\u2019s pretty popular but we managed to feed a giraffe which was amazing! The staff also provide good educational info about the different giraffes!",
          "We had a great experience overall at the Giraffe Centre. The facility was well maintained and the animals seemed to be well cared for. It was an incredible experience to be up close to the gentle giants. The one bull, Edd, was huge, his head was probably twice the size of all",
          "A cool place to be during holidays with a family... But congested because its too small and can't host a big number of people. If the place can be extended then the better or if a group can go in in intervals still the better... @picsinno Photography",
          "We were torn with going here and on one hand they are doing great work and having paying tourists is part of how this is funded. However, it has made this very much like a petting zoo, with lots of tourists trying to push and shove their way into feeding the giraffes. Maybe some",
          "It was really difficult watching these animals get harassed by ignorant tourists who were throwing pellets of food at them or waving branches and hitting them in the face. The giraffes actually ran away. The staff do their best to keep people from climbing on the fences (one kid",
          "The Giraffe Center, a nature sanctuary for visiting and including wildlife conservation education for urban school children. You can observe, hand-feed or even kiss one of the giraffes from a raised wooden structure, which is quite an experience.",
          "A great place for anyone visiting Nairobi to visit. You will learn about Giraffes (Find out why their saliva contains antiseptic) and get to feed them with pallets.",
          "Although the main attraction may be having giraffes eating out of your hand, there was a very interesting lecture about the animals and how the Center is working to increase the population of the Rothschild giraffes. Income supports a very worthy cause.",
          "very crowded. Small space for the giraffes reminiscent of a zoo. they give out small packets of pellet food and I can't imagine its good for the animals to have these overwhelming crowds feeding them this constantly.",
          "Well it is a unique thing to feed a giraffe so there really isn\u2019t anything like this experience. However there isn\u2019t anything beyond that really cool experience. I think we were there and done in a half hour. $15 per person is a little steep for the short but cool experience.",
          "Fascinating close up visit to giraffes with plenty of information about varieties of giraffes and their habits. Also learned about how to support tree planting in the Masai region",
          "The last day in Keny we did a Nairobi tour with our tour guide before going to the airport. The first visit was the Giraffe Center where we stayed a couple of hours. It is possible to give food directly to the mouth of the giraffe.",
          "Cute little pitstop to get up close and personal with Giraffes! By personal I mean Kissing! If you are brave enough to have the giraffe take the food from your mouth, you won\u2019t regret it! It wasn\u2019t sloppy or scary, in fact it was super gentle! You could also view the giraffe",
          "The entry price of $15 is a bit pricey for a 30 minute visit. Having said that, it is free for local school children and it focuses on education and the breeding of the Rothschild Giraffe which is almost extinct. The area for feeding the giraffes is small and as a result",
          "Great place to visit to really see and experience giraffes from close and to hear about their lives.",
          "this was superb fun, we were reluctant to go, but we all loved it, especially kissing the Giraffes, don't be put off when they say you cannot do so.",
          "It was fun to see the giraffes up close and feed them. The center is quite small so you are done with your visit in 15-20 minutes. There are two areas from where you can see the giraffes. As soon as you enter, there is a small open area and at the end of the open area is a",
          "It is a refreshing experience feeding giraffes and I would certainly do it again. The location also easy to find on google maps or Waze. I am not sure the price is fair though and non residents pay almost 4 times what residents pay.",
          "If you want to gaze into the biggest brown eyes you have ever seen, than this is the place to go. There just isn't any animal as graceful and majestic as the Giraffe! This is a place you can go up on the platform that is level with the heads of the giraffes. You can hand feed",
          "A fascinating visit. A reasonably priced cafe. The giraffes come close to the viewing gallery. You are given a bag of food to feed the giraffes. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed.",
          "Came here with the family and had a terrific experience. When we arrived and entered we were each provided with a bag of \"treats\" to feed to the giraffes. An employee of the center escorted us up to the feeding balcony and explained how to place the \"treat\" on the giraffe's",
          "I was a bit disappointed with this centre. Yes, you can feed the giraffes (in a crowd with lots of other tourists pushing for their turn) and you do get some lovely close up views of giraffes, but that's about all there is here. There was minimal information or discussion of",
          "We had just landed in Kenya - all the way from Florida. This event is informative and fun. It is well run and there was no wait time at all. We arrived around 4PM, but were able to gain great access to the giraffes. They have staff members that try to help you get your",
          "For a first time visit it was fascinating to see the animals including warthogs up close. Huge crowds were a bit off putting.",
          "It is well worth a visit a visit to feed the giraffes and learn about the different species in Kenya. There is a small shop and cafe. They are the same giraffes from the Giraffe Manor that walk around to be fed.",
          "This place is great, you were able to get up close to the animals even head height and feed them. They even had guide that can tell you all about the place, the work they do and all about the different types of Giraffe and their differences.",
          "We did as a first up excursion and the decision was a wise one. Feeding, hugging a giraffe is an inner warming experience. We also had a very informative talk by a knowledgeable young lady. The shop was a gem. Beware the crowds build up!",
          "OMG incredible! Got giraffe kisses \ud83d\udc8b. You know the have antiseptic saliva don\u2019t you lol ? Felt like a little girl and cried just a little. Headed off to Karen Blixen\u2019s garden for lunch......I had a farm in Africa.......",
          "The giraffe's are simply amazing. You have as long as you want to feed them and we have some awesome photos!! Would recommend going pretty early in the day though as it gets very busy understandably!!",
          "The Giraffe Centre is a fun place to interact with giraffes. They provide you with pellets to feed them. I suggest going before visiting the elephants or visiting later in the afternoon. Right after David Sheldrick is done is when it is the most busy. Their focus is on",
          "Feeding giraffes is an amazing experience. You can either place the titbit on their tongue or the easier but more sloppy option is for them to lick it off your palm. You end up with a thick slick of their saliva on your palm. There was a lady who put the titbit between her lips",
          "As you walk in you are given a small bag of food in order to feed the Giraffes. They are very interested in the food and allow you to pet them while they are eating. Fun experience but overpriced",
          "There\u2019s not loads to do, but if you\u2019re excited just to see giraffes up close then the Centre is great. You get a bag of pellets each to feed the giraffes with, and there are helpful staff mingling about to answer questions and tell you more about the giraffes (and advise on the",
          "We loved being really close to the giraffes and feefing them. They are very gentle animals. We had amazing pictures and great memories. Highly recommend spending time here.",
          "This place was so much fun. Not only did we learn about giraffes, but we got to hand feed and pet them! The guides were so nice, and instructed us how to best feed them as well as took photos/video for us! Definitely worth a visit!",
          "It's a very interesting place to visit, I highly recommend it. You can feed giraffes. All my friends very happy to do it",
          "Had a 'touristy'feel to it but otherwise a memorable expereince getting up close to these amazing creatures",
          "If someone ask you what \u201cjoy\u201d you get feeding some playful hungry giraffes. Then you should tell them \u201ctry to do yourself\u201d & then make an opinion. Believe me it\u2019s worth it!! There is no better place I know where you can do this. The giraffe comes all the way from it\u2019s resting",
          "Lovely up close and personal experience with the giraffes. Great place to visit if you are trying to find something to do whilst staying in Nairobi. Would highly recommend a visit and you will get some great photos.",
          "This was the very first stop of our safari. Being able to hand feed giraffes was a great way to get started!",
          "We visited the Giraffe Centre about 11 am to miss the afternoon crowds that we had heard about. Only a couple of families there. So were able to spend a lot of time with the giraffes and never felt that anyone was rushing us. A guide came over to us and discussed the centre and",
          "It is such and exceptional experience to be able to see these gentle giants up close. We were able to put food in our lips and have the giraffes kiss us! Priceless!!!!!",
          "We visited the Giraffe Centre as part of a day tour of Nairobi. It was great to learn about the different giraffe species and how to pick their differences. It was fun feeding the giraffes and seeing their long blue tongues swirl around the pellets we held in our hand. They are",
          "It's a good place to see giraffes in the city BUT it's way better to see them in the wild when you go on a safari. We visited as part of a city tour so not sure how much it costs but I can't imagine it being worth the cost since the place is quite small. They give you a small",
          "Firstly, the entrance fee for foreigner compared with locals was ridiculous. We arrived around lunchtime, the crowd was manageable. We fed a couple of giraffes, read some posters and that was it. Very poor show!",
          "Visited on our final day in Nairobi. Very busy so suggest that you get there early but it is a fantastic experience. It is great to get so close to these wonderful animals - an hour there should be enough before heading to the David Sheldrick Trust.",
          "There was no way to manage the people. One lady must have taken hundreds of pictures and wouldn't get out to the way for some else to have a turn. The giraffes seemed over fed and only 2 were interested in coming over to the fence for food. Huge crowds with no control. I guess",
          "If you visit Giraffe Center you won\u2019t be disappointed. I have never been so close to these gracious, gorgeous, magnificent animals. By visiting the Center, I was happy to contribute to their efforts to restore Rothschild's giraffe population. It is one of the most endangered",

          "Upon arrival you received a bag of treat for the giraffes. This is a very enjoyable place to be. It was beautiful. The staff are excellent. You are encouraged to feed the giraffes your hands and they provide soap and water to wash your hands. You are encouraged to attend",

          "I loved being really close to the giraffes. It was a spectacular thing. They are so beautiful. It's a great place and doing very important work to keep the giraffe population up. They had a very interesting presentation on the giraffe breeding program and the giraffe centre. It",

          "Feeding the giraffes was so much fun.Having them eat from the palm of my hand felt a little weird as they use their tongue to get the food. Took some pictures with the giraffes, Fun time.",

          "It was a wonderful first experience of giraffes before heading off on safari. Quite pricey when compared to the length of visit- easily done in 30 minutes (unless you get lost staring into the giraffe\u2019s eyes). Slightly touristy as the staff encourage you to put a food pellet",

          "Visiting the Giraffe Center was great fun! After climbing a flight of stairs (to be on giraffe level), you place a little pellet in your lips and the giraffe gently takes it out with its mouth. Their tongues are very dry, so there is no 'ick lick' factor. Everyone was laughing",
          "We visited at about 3 pm on a Sunday in early August and it was very crowded. There were 5 giraffes in sight but it took the handlers about 20 minutes to coax 2 of my them over to the viewing area so they could be fed by visitors. At this point we had already been on safari,",

        "wiki": "The National Museums of Kenya (NMK) is a state corporation that manages museums, sites and monuments in Kenya. It carries out heritage research, and has expertise in subjects ranging from palaeontology, ethnography and biodiversity research and conservation. Its headquarters and the National Museum (Nairobi National Museum) are located on Museum Hill, near Uhuru Highway between Central Business District and Westlands in Nairobi. The National Museum of Kenya was founded by the East Africa Natural History Society (E.A.N.H.S.) in 1910; the Society's main goal has always been to conduct an ongoing critical scientific examination of the natural attributes of the East African habitat. The museum houses collections, and temporary and permanent exhibits. Today the National Museum of Kenya manages over 22 regional museums, many sites, and monuments across the country.\n\n\n== Nairobi National Museum of Kenya ==\n\n\n=== Natural History Museum of Kenya ===\n\nThe East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society was founded in 1910\u201311 by persons with an interest in nature in British East Africa. The group included two canons of the Church Missionary Society: The Rev. Harry Leakey (father of Louis Leakey) and The Rev. Kenneth St. Aubyn Rogers; some government officials: C. W. Hobley and John Ainsworth, doctors, dentists, big-game hunters and plantation owners. In 1911 they established the Natural History Museum and library with an honorary curator. Aladina Visram put up the money for a one-story, two-room building.In 1914 they could afford a paid curator. They brought in Arthur Loveridge, a herpetologist, who arrived in March 1914. Loveridge concentrated on collections, with the members volunteering to contribute specimens, labour and funds. They also ran the museum while Loveridge fought for the British in German East Africa. He returned for a brief stay after the war, only to go to America, where he eventually became a Harvard University professor.\n\n\n=== Coryndon Museum ===\nThe next curator was A. F. J. Gedye. The museum moved to a new building at the corner of Government Road and Kirk Road. Among the new volunteers for the society were Sir Robert Coryndon, Governor of Kenya. At his unexpected death in 1925, Lady Coryndon established the Coryndon Memorial Fund to build a better museum for the society in memory of her husband. The government offered matching funds for public donations and in 1928 construction began.\nThe building was ready in 1929. Unfortunately no workrooms or storage space had been provided and therefore the Natural History Society declined to move in. The government then bought the old museum and the society used the money to add three rooms, gave its collections to the museum trustees, but retained the library. Everything was moved to the museum. Lady Coryndon donated Sir Robert's books to it.\nThe museum was officially opened on 22 September 1930, as Coryndon Museum, with Victor Gurney Logan Van Someren, a member, as curator. He was given a house on the grounds. In 1930 Evelyn Molony, n\u00e9e Napier was appointed the Museum's first botanist after a grant was given to the Museum by Ernest Carr to fund her employment. During her tenure she established within the Museum a herbarium on East African plants as well as publishing a series of scientific papers on East African flora.The relationship between the museum trustees and the society became problematic, and as a result the two organisations appointed a committee including Sir Charles Belcher, a Kenyan jurist, to stabilise it. The committee turned everything over to the museum except for the library in exchange for annual payments for 15 years to the society.\nThe museum now had a staff. Mary Leakey became part of it and then Louis Leakey, as unpaid curator, in 1941. He stepped in when Dr. van Someren resigned after the board (including Louis) refused to dismiss Peter Bally in a personality conflict. The museum was a center for Leakey operations. In 1945 Louis was hired as paid curator with a new house, as the old one had become run-down. He built up the exhibitions and opened them to Africans and Asians by lowering the admission fee. Until then the museum had been \"for whites only.\"\nThe museum was a base for Leakey operations until 1961, when Louis founded the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the grounds nearby and moved himself and his collections to it. He resigned in favour of the next director, Robert Carcasson.\n\n\n=== National Museum ===\nKenya became independent in 1963. The Coryndon Museum was renamed \"National Museum\" in 1964 and was included in a new system, the \"National Museums of Kenya.\" In 1967 Richard Leakey was having irreconcilable differences with Louis Leakey, his employer in the Centre, and decided to improve the National Museum. His main objection was that it had not been Kenyanized. He and supporters formed the Kenya Museum Associates, which obtained an observer's seat for Richard on the board from Carcasson in exchange for a 5000-pound contribution. Richard did not do much observing, as he departed for the first Omo expedition.\nThe Kenya Museum Associates included Joel Ojal, the museum overseer in the government. On his return from Omo Richard gave his ideas for improvement directly to Joel, who asked the chairman, Sir Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck, to place Richard in a senior position and begin replacing the board with Kenyans of Kenyan extraction, as there were only two out of 16 in that category. The penalty for inaction would be removal of government funding.\nRichard was at first offered a part-time executive position, which he turned down. Over the next few months much of the board was replaced and in May 1968 the new board offered Richard a permanent post as administrative director, with Carcasson to be retained as scientific director. However, Carcasson resigned and Richard became director.\n\n\n=== Gallery of Kenyan Ethnic Communities ===\nThis gallery contains artwork by Joy Adamson featuring various Kenyan communities in traditional attire.\n\n\n=== Modern events and facilities ===\nOn 15 October 2005 Nairobi Museum Galleries closed until December 2007 for an extensive rebuilding program. This was the first major renovation of Nairobi Museum since 1930. A new administration block and commercial center were built, and NMK's physical planning was improved.The Museum re-opened in June 2008. It houses both temporary and permanent exhibitions.Within the grounds are also the Nairobi Snake Park and the Botanic Garden and nature trail. The museum's commercial wing has restaurants and shops.\n\n\n== Other museums ==\n\nOther museums, sites and monuments operated by the NMK, including eco-tourist attractions are:\n\nNairobi Gallery, Nairobi\nUhuru Gardens, Nairobi\nInstitute of Primate Research, Nairobi\nFort Jesus, Mombasa\nGedi ruins, Gedi, near Malindi\nHyrax Hill Prehistoric site and Museum, near Nakuru\nJumba la Mtwana, Mtwapa, near Mombasa\nKabarnet Museum, Kabarnet\nKaren Blixen Museum, Nairobi\nKapenguria Museum, Kapenguria\nKariandusi Museum, near Gilgil\nKisumu Museum, Kisumu\nKitale Museum, Kitale\nKoobi Fora, at Sibiloi National Park\nLamu Museum, Lamu\nMeru Museum, Meru\nMnarani ruins, Kilifi\nNarok Museum, Narok\nOlorgesailie, near Magadi\nSiyu Fort, Pate Island\nTakwa ruins, Manda Island\nThimlich Ohinga, 45 km west of Migori\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Kenya\nList of sites and monuments in Kenya\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Leakey Fights Church Effort to Hide Museum's Pre-Human Fossils\".",

        "wiki": "Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife.\nDespite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew\u2014it had 14,000 residents by 1910\u2014conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe park covers an area of 117.21 km2 (45.26 sq mi) and is small in comparison to most of Africa's national parks. The park's altitude ranges between 1,533 and 1,760 m (5,030 and 5,774 ft). It has a dry climate. The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem. The park has a diverse range of habitats and species.The park is located about 7 km (4.3 mi) from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe park's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include African buffalo, baboon, eastern black rhinoceros, gazelle, Grant's zebra, cheetah, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotamus, African leopard, lion, common eland, impala, Masai giraffe, ostrich, vultures and waterbuck.Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.\n\nThe David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means \"Rhinoceros Sanctuary\". It is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nMervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.\n\n\n== Tourism and education ==\nNairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week.The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrett, Michael; Christine Riley (1995).

          "We stayed until 5:30pm to see the lions get fed. This was pretty awesome. However, the men in charge of feeding the animals were drunk and smelled like alcohol. They also kept hitting the cages in order to aggravate the lions. I don't think it's safe to have drunk people",

          "I must confess that I in generaly have mixed feelings with zoos. This time I thought it would be something different but I was very disappointed. The price is 25$ for one non-resident and it is not worth it! The areas for different animals were quite miserable and small, there",

          "The Nairobi Safari Walk gives your a revitalizing moment from the hassling busy life of the city. The wild animals are in a semi-wild habitat and seeing them while enjoying the walk is worthwhile! It is a rewarding personal, friends of family outing experience you will never",

          "I have been there several years ago. It was nice but Yes overpriced. I really wanted to go again today but after Reading the latest reviews i do'nt think i would visit again. The responsible should really review the whole setup if they want visitors to the Walk!!!",
          "Worth the $25 since i got to see a rhino and a leopard in a far away tree branch. We went on a weekday when it was very slow and could spend as much time as we wanted taking pictures and looking at animals. It's hard to see rhinos up close in the safaris or game drives and the",
          "So I saved my money on the orphanage, but coughed out $25 for this one. Horrible value. Confined animals. Very short walk and nothing natural about it. Another overpriced, unfriendly, depressing example of African tourism. And thanks for the 91 KSh exchange rate by the way, as",

          "Was a great experience. The park's very easy to access from the main road. Would recommend an early start. The payment process is easy and fairly quick. Inside the park the roads are okay for a self drive as long as you have a 4X4/vehicle with adequate ground clearance.",

          "Perfect wild gateway few minutes from the city !",
          "Meh. It was good a few years ago when it opened. But they have let it go down badly. Many animal pens are now empty, especially the exciting big cats. But they try to make you think it's your fault for not getting there early enough when the animals are active. Don't believe it!",

        "wiki": "The Karen Blixen Museum, located 10 km outside of Nairobi, Kenya, \"at the foot of the Ngong Hills\", is the former African home of Danish author Karen Blixen, famous for her 1937 book Out of Africa which chronicles life at the estate.\n\n\n== History ==\nLocated in what was then British East Africa, the bungalow-style house which is now the Karen Blixen Museum was built in 1912 by the Swedish engineer \u00c5ke Sj\u00f6gren, The house and its attached property were bought in 1917 by Karen Blixen and her husband, Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke with the intention of operating a coffee plantation. After the Blixens separated in 1921, Karen Blixen continued to live at the house and run the plantation until she returned to Denmark 1931 for good. Her life here is chronicled in her most famous book, Out of Africa, as well as in her book Shadows of the Grass.After Blixen's death in 1962, the house was donated by the Danish government in 1964 to the new Kenyan government as an independence gift and was opened to the public in 1986 as one of Kenya's national museums, following the popularity of the 1985 movie, Out of Africa. However, this site was not where the Out of Africa was filmed, as the pictures were taken in Blixen's first farmhouse, Mbagathi, nearby, where she lived between 1914 and 1917. Nowadays the museum is situated in the upscale Nairobi suburb named \"Karen,\" which was created by the land re-parceling of the coffee farm, after Blixen's return to Denmark.The Karen Blixen Museum is open every day between 09:30 and 18:00, including on weekends and public holidays. Visitors have the opportunity to take part in continuously offered guided tours of the house, which features rooms designed in both the original decor and with props from the 1985 film. The grounds, which feature original equipment from the coffee farm, are also available for touring. There is also a gift shop. The grounds of the museum are available to rent for weddings, corporate functions, and other events.\n\n\n== Map coordinates ==\n\nKenya museum map coordinates: 1\u00b0 21.110\u2032 S and 36\u00b0 42.750\u2032 E.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum Shop\nMuseum website, Kenya",

          "If you are familiar with the movie then the museum will mean more to you. The house is well preserved as it was when Karen Blixen actually lived there. A guide takes you through the house and explains the features of each room. Interestingly, the rooms are somewhat small. There",
          "The house featured in the Oscar winning movie OUT OF AFRICA so if you are movie buff and fan of Karen Blixen's story, then by all means do visit this place. Costs about USD 12 pp to enter. You don't need too much time here - an hour at the most.",
          "I had seen the 'Out of Africa' film so could recall parts of the Karen Blixen sorry. What an admirable women she was for her time. She did so much for Kenyan people. It was sad to hear of the circumstances of her death. Her wonderful garden and museum help to immortalize her",

          "Great description of the lady, her life, her forward thinking but unfortunately poor farming. Makes me want to read her books. Great recreation of the place as it was. Grounds are well kept as well. Great trees in the property.",
          "We had an excellent guide through the house and grounds, but it wasn't among my favorite places to tour.",
          "A very well-spent hour of reflection. Karen Blixen's work in Nairobi is well documented. The tour guide was very gracious and informative.It is no wonder she is revered. An unforgettable experience.",
          "I have been to Nairobi several times but somehow missed visiting the Karen Blixen museum, even though I stay locally in Karen (named after her) It was a fascinating visit totally brought to life by my guide Fatuma. Very interesting house, beautiful grounds and well worth a",
          "I told my family, if we're going to Nairobi for vacation this year, then we HAVE to go to the Karen Blixen Museum. Oh, I was not disappointed. Out of Africa is one of my favourite films and to see the house, at the foot of the Ngong Hills, well it was wonderful. The price of the",
          "We spent about an hour here. The guides are very passionate about Karen and the museum, and they provide an abundance of information. The grounds of the museum are beautful.",
          "A personal guide at no extra cost to us showed us around the beautiful old home and grounds. He told us the story of Karen Blixen and her importance to Africa. He was very knowledgable and very willing to answer our questions. His English was very good and easy to understand. It",
          "Interesting site with lots of references to Karen Blixen\u2019s life in and out of Africa albeit a bit overpriced for what it was - a small house on a plot of land with a garden. Our guide Miriam was well prepared and presented all the highlights with accuracy and enthusiasm. She was",

          "I knew nothing of Karen until i was in Kenya and saw her name on many buildings in Nairobi. Washington the tour guide was funny and well suited for the task of a tour guide. Very knowledgeable. Of course we took pictures. Fun time.",
          "An interesting way to spend an afternoon whilst in Nairobi, it may get a little boring for very young children but as an adult I enjoyed hearing of some of the History of colonialism Kenya and the Karen Brixton story. Make sure you have a guide they do not get paid by the",
          "The site is pleasant and gives a real sense of the world of Karen Blixen. The guide did a good job but her English was so heavily accented we didn't understand a lot of it.",
          "A very beautiful area and story. However knowledgeable our guide, she didn't tell us about the nature walk so we missed it. I'm more interested in reading Out of Africa as a result of this visit.",
          "If you've watched the movie Out of Africa and are planning to visit The Karen Blixen Museum, I would advise you to re-watch it again before visiting, so your mind can absolutely blow when you do the tour. Totally worth a visit. The story's incredible, the house, items in the",
          "Since there ia not much to do in Nairobi, i would recommend you to visit thia museum. Our guide Michelle was very friendly and she gave us a lot of information about Karen Blixen.",
          "Nice intro to the life of Karen Blixen.Too much time spent on outside tractors,etc.outside house.House itself,pictures and furniture interesting.I had forgotten that she wrote Babette's Feast.",
          "Better for adults than for children. Expensive for non-resident adults at KSh 1,200 each. Citizen adults KSh 200 each. We took 2.5h for a guided tour and taking photos outside; it could be done in less time. Photography is not allowed in the house. The photos show the front and",
          "Not to be missed for fans of the book or the movie, otherwise it is just a nice activity, but nothing of historic or natural importance. I was given a private guide who knew the entire Karen Blixen and Baron Bor Blixen's story, he could answer all my questions.",
          "If you've read the book, this place will give you goosebumps. You'll enjoy each and every part of this guided tour. The garden, each room of the house and the natural beauty. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll be urged to read it after living this memory.",
          "This is a lovely and extremely informative site about the history and development of the Nairobi region; plus, it is a great break from the congestion & bustle of central Nairobi. Highly recommend to all Nairobi visitors!",

          "The home of the \"Out of Africa\" novel is a must see! Historically fascinating, the Blixen house is a tribute to her courage, her verve for life and, sadly, the issues facing a woman author in the early 20th century. It takes only an hour or so but be sure you have one of the",
          "Anyone who has seen the movie or read the book will enjoy visiting this museum. It is exactly the way it was back in her day, from the amazingly few kitchen implements that her chef used to prepare dinner for the Prince of Wales to the furniture in the rooms. There was one",
          "Visited the museum as part of our tour gardens were lovely but the museum was dark inside and slightly boring Learned that Ms. Blixen had a very difficult life Unless you're a huge fan of hers- not really worth the trip",
          "This was included as part of our itinerary and wish we could have saved our limited time in Kenya and did something else. The grounds were immaculate, everything was clean. Our guide was amazing and very sweet; however it was just not for my family. Too boring. Sorry.",
          "It's a quick tour, but I thought it was interesting. I think it meant more to me because knowing this house was in the movie Out Of Africa. I decided I need to see the movie again so I can study the house. It was nice because we had visited the Giraffe and Sheldrick Elephant",
          "Stopped here as part of a tour of Nairobi. Boring...You are not allowed to take and photos inside of the house. The grounds around the house are beautiful, but I would not return.",
          "35 years ago I watched the movie Out of Africa, with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford as the main actors. It was based on Danish author Karen Blixen's book of the same title, about life on the estate, now a museum chronicling her life.",

          "What an amazing woman she was. I learnt a lot of her history and her sad demise to alcohol and cigarettes. Her marriage and her boyfriend was interesting to say the least. She was also an incredible painter and her artwork was brilliant. I found this a great tour and her home",
          "Didn't know what to expect and haven't seen the Out of Africa movie but I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Well worth a visit. I did it as part of a day excursion of Nairobi NP, David Sheldrick & giraffe feeding zoo. All well worth doing - a great day out!",
          "We had a great time with our guide learning about Karen Blixen. We were not familiar with her background before the tour. It was an informative afternoon activity. We enjoyed touring the grounds.",
          "My wife and I stopped by this place mostly to kill some time and explore some cultural impacts of the area during a down day and what a surprise. A very pleasant personal tour guide explains the significance of Karen blixen, her story and contributions to the area. A nice way to",
          "I was able to walk around the house freely during a visit in 1986 one year after Meryl Streep filmed Out of Africa. Richard Leakey was there and introduced himself, sadly I had no idea who he was! I wish I had another chance now. The pith helmet worn by Meryl Streep was sitting",
          "Another tour through Natural World Kenya Safaris. The museum is very well conserved and the guide gave us a complete and interesting briefing about the museum, the farm, the gardens, and the story of Karen Blixen. By the way, I had seen Out of Africa, a great movie, so when we",
          "Our visit was very brief after a long day so I may not have gotten all of the information the guides normally give. He made references to the book or movie. If your familiar with the book than its a good stop to bring it alive. If not, its just a colonial home and maybe not a",
          "You don\u2019t need to see the movie or read the books to appreciate this piece of Kenyan history. The guides do a great job of telling Karen\u2019s story and pointing out unique features of the grounds.",
          "She really cared about the welfare of her employees and education for their children. Something that was frowned upon at that time. Fast forward, the movie Out of Africa debuts and tourism begins an upswing in Nairobi. Very good fortune for Kenya and its people that she loved so",
          "The tour guide did a wonderful job orienting us on the Karen Blixen story, pointing out every detail of the home and furnishings. The tour took about an hour and was very interesting if you have any connection to Karen Blixen's story. My husband and I were quite engaged, since",
          "Went there as a family. The tickets are priced n the higher side and I would suggest special rates for COMESA citizens. The guide did a good job of explaining the story of Karen. It gave an insight into life in Kenya one century ago. Do visit the restaurant nearby too. Its",

          "Nice place to learn about the history of karen blixen. The upmarket area is named after the lady karen. It\u2019s also ideal for private functions since it has very nice and green grounds.",
          "Washington was a knowledgeable and fascinating guide who made the stories of the life of Karen Blixen come alive. He was stimulating and informative and kept us enthralled during his tour of the museum and gardens",
          "This is the \"I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills\" moment. Enjoyed the guided tour which gave a little more insights into Karen's life than the movie but felt a bit forced (you have to take the guide) and rushed (probably because it was just me so a bit awkward",
          "The museum is okay. It is an interesting place to visit especially if you're interested in history. However, Kenyan history cannot be told without colonization which Karen blixen was a part of; so I can't seem to understand why the tour guides were painting a picture of Blixen",
          "Really enjoyed informative guided tour. Not too crowded and beautiful gardens with interesting stories.",
          "This was a great experience. You see the house as it was and you can wander through the rooms. It is very interesting and surprisingly small. The downside was you have to take a guide. I felt mine rushed it probably because there was only one person and his tip would not be",
          "The original items usedby the Dutch lady Karen Blixen still intact.A lot of history and discover the relationships between Africa and her colonial masters.No photos inside the house just your eyes.If interested in history it's ok.",
          "If you are a Karen Blixen fan, this is a must do. Easy to get to in Nairobi and with really excellent tour guides, the Karen Blixen Museum is filled with history from a pivotal time in our past. This is where she experienced and wrote Out of Africa.",
          "If you are a fan of Karen Blixen I would definitely recommend you going to see her house. It is a short tour of the grounds and her house.",
          "I visited this museum only and only because I love Out of Africa movie. I watched it a month before my trip, just to refresh my memory. After that my visit was both informative and romantic. Without that I wouldn't enjoyed as much as I did. So, worthwhile if you know the movie",
          "Karen Blixen was a character larger than life and the tour of the museum and gardens confirms that characterization. Enthusiastic guides take visitors through the house and garden unraveling layers of the personality that was Karen Blixen. Especially if you are a fan, it is",
          "Enjoyed our guided tour with a friendly and informative guide who provided very interesting background and historical information. The house itself is not glamorous or glitzy but very homely and real. Recommended as a worthwhile place to visit.",
          "This is a low key museum, helps if you know Karen Blixen books and movies. Nice setting and grounds, interesting house. Our guide was really good, and this helped enormously.",
          "We have been to the Karen Blixen museum three times. The first time, the tour was not very organized, but when we went in 2018 & 2019, they had a very interesting tour led by trained guides. They tell the background of the area and how she got to that location. It was fun to see",
          "Walking through the house/museum, you are taken back to the days when the Europeans were colonizing Africa. The adventures, the people, the natives, the way of life, and the beauty of Africa. A visit to this museum will not disappoint.",
          "Part of my safari tour. Loved the movie and did not know a lot about the author until I took the informative tour and saw the household. Felt like you could be transported back in time to when she was there and the animals were roaming. A rather peaceful and beautiful setting.",
          "While worth the visit, especially for us as we loved the movie Out of Africa, I though the entry fee was expensive compared to for example what we paid at Elephant Orphanage [ usd 5]. Still the visit was enjoyable.",
          "We spent a very pleasant afternoon here - a very interesting place . We learnt a lot about the author and her life.",
          "Get an experience of precolonial Kenya into independence. The life one of the first women writers, in an era of male dominance. Learn, explore and experience!",
          "nice and informative tour around the museum by staff. The garden grounds are nice to walk around and relax in.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the tour. This tour takes about 1-2 hours but is well worth it. We combined it with tours of the Giraffe Center and the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust all in the same day.",
          "Visited some years ago. Fantastic opportunity to gain a sense of an era of explorers and entrepreneurs keen to establish a life in Kenya. Is colonial and of an age some people may or may not agree with but I found this place to be personal and offering an authentic perspective",
          "We had rewatched Out of Africa and White Mischief movies before our trip to Kenya so were up to speed on the Holywood version of the history. Our guide, Emily was excellent and brought the true story to life especially regarding other family members and wider writings. If you do",
          "So great to actually see the place where such an amazing, impactful human being lived. Our guide was very knowledgeable and pleasant. Loved it!",
          "It really helps to see Out of Africa before going here. It is so easy to imagine what it was like during the time Karen lived here. Some of the trees were planted by Karen almost 100 years ago!",
          "Plenty to see here. The guides are excellent and it\u2019s good to see the rooms exactly as they were used. You\u2019re round the whole experience in an hour. Perfect.",
          "We had a great young guide that gave us a good overview of Karen Blixens' life before giving us a tour of the house and it's details. Glad we went after a long day, it was totally worth it.",
          "Its a good visit if you have watched the movie '''Out of Africa''. The Victorian style furniture and other stuff is alluring. The house-turned-museum itself is very beautiful. Overall a good experience",
          "If you watched the move \"out of Africa\" it's almost a must. Well kept and it's worthwhile taking a guide to explain the details. The nearby restaurant is good place to have lunch afterwards.",
          "On balance, we really enjoyed this attraction. We had a fantastic young tour guide who was very knowledgeable about the history and grounds - all perfectly preserved. There is an opportunity to relax in gardens and generally go at your own pace (except in the house when its",
          "Visiting a movie set, but its not a set...its real. Furniture, old kitchen features and tools, and old Victrola all serve to take you back to the movie.Its time well spent if you;re a fan.",
          "It was an interesting and fun way to spend an hour or so. When I get back home, I\u2019ll definitely want to watch \u201cOut of Africa\u201d.",
          "We really enjoyed this visit the guides were great and the museum is very well displayed. Her story is well told. A nice gift shop there and local artwork. There isn't a cafe there but just down the road is a lovely resturant.",
          "This is a necessary stop for anyone who\u2019s read the book, or seen the Out of Africa movie. It was easy to imagine Karen and Dennis on the porch of this magnificent house. Tourists are not allowed to explore on their own though, and are assigned a guide to tour the house. The",
          "Not only was this the home of a remarkable woman, it also gives visitors a brief glimpse into what Nairobi must have been like before development. The beautiful old home nestles in a large garden and in the distance are the famous Ngong Hills. Now they are home to wind turbines",
          "Were more than impressed as each group is assigned an intern who takes them round the estate, explaining every bit of the history of the home turned museum and the life of Karen. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable of the museum, quite cheerful and answered all our questions",
          "We really enjoyed our tour of the Karen Blixen Museum! Our guide knew a lot about Karen Blixen's life and home and we learned an incredible amount! The gardens were absolutely beautiful and there is a nice little nature trail on the property!",
          "I didn't know much about Karen Blixen before visiting her home, and I left with a new appreciation of Karen, her experiences & her life. Our guide thru the museum/home was very knowledgeable about Karen and seemed to make her experiences comes to life for us.",
          "If you\u2019re in the area, it\u2019s nice to stop by. They filmed the outside scenes of \u201cOut of Africa\u201d on-site. The house and museum is pretty small, so you can see it all in under an hour. When you arrive, they assign a guide to take you around, which is nice. I wouldn\u2019t make the trip",
          "Beautiful location but I think anyone not familiar with Karen Blixen's story or uninterested in buildings would be disappointed.",
          "I recommend that you do the guided tour, it was really informative. It enables you to envision what Nairobi was like, raw wilderness and all. For those who have seen and/or read Out of Africa, this is a must do attraction.",
          "I love History and I had a great time here. The history is well reserved and gives you this mind blowing imagination of how life was back then.",
          "I found it very interesting. Though I must admit that 1200 ksh for non Kenyan visitors is quite steep 200 ksh for Kenyans. Though it was quite an interesting tour round the place.",
          "for those who have watched the movie out of africa,this is the place to be just 30 min drive from the cbd.",
          "Most everyone knows the Blixen story and the house is well presented. However, if not for the Out of Africa movie I wonder if a visit would add much to your knowledge of Kenya. In my opinion a refocus on the lifestyle of the folks in the first 20 years of the the 20th century",
          "Place to learn about Karen, visit her home and her her story. Relaxing place to spend some time before or after Safari (or just while in Nairobi).",
          "We got a tour guide and he did a good job explaining about the history for Karen Blixen. House and surroundings is well maintained and you really feel the history about the place. Easy to enter with Uber and entrance fee are very reasonable.",
          "A compulsory Tour Guide takes you through the house after first showing you some rusty tools and machinery in the garden. Our guide described every object in the house in these terms: This is the bed Karen Blixen slept in. This is the wash basin she washed her face in. This is",
          "Get a glimpse of the history of Karen named after Karen Blixen. This house hosts the story in Out of Africa movie. Its lovely",
          "The authentic Karen home is interesting to visit as it reflects so many things related to early settlers and humanity from Karen B side. The entry fee comes with a guide who will walk you thru the story behind Karen B, her life, her art and living. Enjoy the scenery and calmness",
          "Even if you are not very interested in Karen Blixen, this is a good place to visit. You can see something about a way of life colonialists had.",
          "Very good guides, the house has a lot of history the visit encouraged me to go watch the movie \"Out of Africa\"",
          "Having visited a few years ago, we brought guests here, very interesting and the guide was very informative. If you have watched the film \"Out of Africa\", then this sits really well with her life story.",
          "This was over priced in my opinion. Its just an old house that was built by a woman who lived there , wrote a book about it that later became a Hollywood hit. If you have an hour to spare . Not bad",
          "15 dollars to enter a house with very few exceptional things unless you are a KB fan or Out of Africa fan. Then yes, it is worth it. The guide was great, lovely and very nice, but honestly there is not much really to say about the place if you are not really into it, she kept",
          "There whole place takes about an hour. When you arrive, you'll have to pay entrance fees which I think were very steep. You'll get your own private tour guide who will walk you around the grounds and tell you the history of the place and her life. There is always a nature trail",
          "Karen, a wonderful lady who got married and lived in this house. Her husband started coffee plantation to get fast rich, but the soil acidity did not helped him. He moved to Safaris before they got separated. Karen used to stay in this house which became a museum later on. A",
          "Peacefull place also for people who didn't read the book or see the movie. Karen Blixon house gives you a good idea about life 100 years ago. Arranged with love to detail. Take your time walk around don't forget the kitchen and the park. Guide is not important. For those who",
          "I like books of Karen Blixen. Actually, it was one of the reason why I love Kenya so much - after reading of memories of writer Karen Blixen about her life in Kenya (Out of Africa) I am fascinated by Kenya forever. This place is her real home in Kenya. So for such \"fans\" of",
          "A trip to Karen Blixen museum gives you a taste of European style of living in the days of British Africa Karen Blixen is famed to have been responsible ( it was her husband's idea) to bring coffee cultivation to East Africa, then known as British Africa. The movie \" Out of",
          "Here the famous Danish author lived before she was famous and before she became an author. But she had an interesting life and here on the Farm in Africa they know how to tell about Karen. The guide was almost in love with her and was very proud to talk about her. The guide",
          "Karen Blixen museum is located in the beautiful and lush neighborhood of Karen. Driving upto the museum itself is a treat although the traffic to the suburb can be chaotic at times. Do not expect too much of a perfect recreation of history as things in the house are run down.",
          "Nice place to see once. It take not longer than 1 hour to see everything. Bit run down and the carriages you can see outside, would need some restoration.",
          "The Karen Blixen Museum, is always on the root, if you have ever seen out of Africa. The House is interesting, however the furniture is not original, from her time. The tour is very short, and expensive. The garden is free and nice to walk around in and have your picture taken.",
          "Considering the hype surrounding the historical significance of Karen Blixen, what is on show is poor and well below average for the price you pay to get in. Not much thought or effort on the part of National Museums of Kenya. Lasting impression I was left with; its just about",
          "This museum was included on our group tour on a stopover in Nairobi and I was surprised at how interesting it was. I had read the \u2018Out of Africa\u2019 book and seen the movie so I probably had more knowledge of Karen\u2019s life. Our guide was excellent and he spoke very good English. He",

          "Really Nice place and a very interesting insight to how things used to be. Would recommend it to everyone.",
          "The home is located about a 15 minute drive from Giraffe Manor. It is well worth a visit if you are in the area. I only gave it a 4 because it could use more visuals e.g. maybe a video presentation of Karen's life. Seeing \"Out of Africa\" is wonderful but it only touches on a",
          "We were guided through Karen Blixen's home by a very knowledgeable docent, who provided a lot of information in the short period that we were in the house. The house was surprisingly small. Fortunately, the curators have been able to re-acquire some of her possessions to furnish",
          "A local guide showed us through we were on the trial of this famous author and had read her books so it was a thrill to see the house and some of her possessions. The gardens were a little rundown and it would be lovely if the conservation society bought them up to standard",
          "The museum is the actual home of Karen Blixen. Portions of the home were used in the \u201cOut of Africa \u201c movie. The tour guides were cinematography majors.",
          "My Mother's favourite movie is 'Out of Africa' so naturally I had to take her to the museum. I thought the price was a little steep, but it came with an unexpected guided tour which ended up being excellent and worth the money. Our guide was very knowledgeable, fun and relaxed.",
          "Great guides that had excellent knowledge on the history of the Blixen museum. Filled in so many gaps that the movie left out. We learnt so much more about Karen Blixen and what legacy she left for the community. The pre talk prior to the visit was well worth listening to",
          "As part of our tour we visited the museum. It was very interesting to see and the lady giving us the tour was very informative. It prepared us for the remainder of our trip to Africa. We are now looking forward to seeing the movie again.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this!! A beautiful commemoration of her life and work set in beautiful grounds. Our tour guide was fantastic, thanks George, and the wedding in the grounds was an added bonus.",
          "A house where Danish writer Karen Blixen lived. Most of original furniture is there and guide was very knowledgeable.",
          "Spent a hour touring the museum. It was the house that she lived in when she was in Kenya. The grounds are very beautiful.",
          "After everything the city has to offer, this place seems a little underwhelming. Thinking of it now, I believe we could\u2019ve skipped this to spend sometime at the Natiobal Museum or snake park. Might be a note exciting for history enthusiasts, we didn\u2019t find it very interesting",
          "Visiting the Karen Blixin house and museum was an absolute treat. We were so lucky to have Emily as our guide and what an ambassador for the museum. The your starts with sitting under the trees, looking ahead at the house while the story behind Karen\u2019s life and its link to her",

          "Pretty boring unless one is a Karen Blixen fan. A guide explained the history of the house, then the Karen Blixen life story before entrance to the house. The house and the furniture were pretty ordinary other than Karen Blixen lived there. Definitely not a must do!",
          "This is a quaint museum for those fans of Karen Blixen and Out of Africa. The group I was with didn't know anything about these things so chose just to sit in the grounds and wait for me. I proceeded alone and was lucky enough to get my own guided tour. The lady was very nice",

          "If you have seen the movie and it has inspired you to visit Kenya, do not miss the Karen Blixen Museum. The house remains as Karen left it when she returned to Denmark after her beloved Denys Finch Hatton was killed in a plane accident. Wonderful guides take you through room by",
          "Upon arrival we were paired with Peter as our guide and could not have been more pleased with his knowledge and presentation about the museum and the life of Karen Blixen. The guided tour takes about 1 hour and begins with a seated intro on the front lawn. It ends out back",

          "If you are really into Karen Blixen, this might be an interesting place to visit. Since I (and the rest of our group) were only minimally familiar with her through the movie Out of Africa, this made the tour tedious. Our guide described every object in the house in these terms:",
          "The house is small but they do have actual things that belonged to Karen Blixen. Our guide did a good job of taking us thru the rooms. See Out of Africa to have the embellished version of the story, both movie and house are worth seeing.",

          "We had a great visit to the Museum and a dream come true for this Out of Africa fan! Our tour started by sitting out on the lawn and hearing all about Karen Blixen's life and references to the film. We were then escorted through the house learning all about Karen's life.",
          "We were very pleased of our visit. We had a lovely guide who knew very well the story of Karen Blixen and who was able to carry us back into the past. The house is well maintain and you can easily project yourself back in those times. Little suggestion to the futur visitors,",
          "The museum is in a lovely setting in Karen. It's a well-preserved piece of history , but definitely overpriced, despite including a guide in the cost. It's nice, but not that interesting unless you are a Kenyan history buff or into the books or movie. Plan on about an hour",
          "If you loved the movie, it is definitely a place to go. The house and the surroundings are nice. However, there is nothing very special or absolutely a must-see. So I wouldn\u2019t recommend sacrificing safari time for this.",
          "I wish all museums were like this. The guide we had challenged us to come up with a question to stump him and we couldn't--and this is from a crowd who's read her books and seen the movies. The place is so very charming and well-preserved. If you loved the book Out of Africa,",

          "The museum is a fitting and lovely tribute to a woman who did so much for the region and the world. It is a little bit of a distance from some other sights but would highly recommend it.",
          "Nice to have visited Karen's home and to better understand what prompted her writings, especially Out of Africa. Guides were very informative and did not rush visitors. They answered all questins that were put forward in a professional maner.",
          "I loved this. It was so interesting. A real sense of what it must have been like at that time. I was surprised it was so accesible as I had always imagined it in the wilds somewhere and when I knew I could visit it in Nairobi went straight away and was not disapointed.",
          "Having seen the movie OUT IF AFRICA I was intrigued to visit the house which is now a museum. The locals speak with high regard for Karen Blixen, a woman who has left a very deep mark on Kenya, the Kikouyou and the land. The house is kept in an excellent condition and the guide",
          "We spent about 1.5 hours at the Karen Blixen Museum and learned more than I would have imagined. Every guest gets a private tour all around the house and grounds. Worth a visit if you have some time to kill in Nairobi.",
          "Assuming that this would be an interesting way to spend an afternoon, we were disappointed from the moment we tried to pay for our admission. The woman issuing tickets was in the middle of a personal phone call on her mobile and pointedly ignored us. No welcoming smile, no",
          "There's a lot of colonial type history in this area of Nairobi, and this museum helps travelers to see how Ms. Blixen lived. Even today the \"higher-rent\" area of Nairobi is still called simply Karen.",
          "If you are passionate of her story you can't miss this place! If you are not just go and take the opportunity to touch a piece of story! The house and the yard is still so vibrant of her presence and the tour guide (included in the price but don't forget to tip them) Will take",

          "You will get a guide and they will tell you everything about every object in the house. The house is very well maintained and has an absolutely beautiful and lush garden. You really get back in time. It was very interesting to hear what the kenians thought about Karen.",
          "The best thing about this place is you get to learn ot ony about the out africa author Karen Blixen but also the social scene of 1900s and relations of the locals and the british cllonialists then..",
          "This little bungalow from the past carries a lot of secrets with it. One can feel and smell its past as they are guided through the rooms, especially if you watched 'Out of Africa'! There is a lot of rich history associated with the house itself, and also with Nairobi as we know",
          "You learn about the life of Karen Blixen and see a house she lived in. The entrance fee includes a guided tour. The nature walk at the end of the tour is very pretty.",
          "So we did a tour that included a visit to the Karen Blixen museum. While the house is interesting, I felt the fee being charged was on the higher side considering that the Elephant orphanage charges much less and offers such a superb experience.",
          "An enchanting tour of the home of Karen Blixen, coffee plantation owner and author of Out of Africa. Immaculate grounds, and the tour guide shared many intriguing facts of Karen, her life and struggles living in Kenya. The grounds has a gift shop where you can purchase Karen's",
          "Stopped into the Karen Blixen Museum and learned a lot about this amazing woman. This is a much different picture than the one depicted in the movie Out of Africa. I found the guide friendly and engaging. You do have to pay to enter/see the museum, how else does one think",
          "If you are in Nairobi, this is must see place. Amazing place, very polite guides and story about extraordinary woman. Excellent place to hear a little bit more about Kenya's history.",
          "If your vision of Karen Blixen was formed by the movie, you are in for a shock! Still, the house is beautifully maintained, the guides interesting and it's easy to feel Karen's ghost here, especially if you linger at the back of the house staring at the Ngong Hills. A must see.",
          "In a lovely setting and with a wonderful, but ultimately sad, story to relive from your experience here. Guides do an excellent job conveying background and history of life at the time it was a residence and working farm. A tribute also to the work Karen Blixen did for local",
          "Very interesting visit. Guide was Interesting and knowledgeable. Karen Blixen was an interesting and talented lady and the setting of the house is breath taking. The linkage to the movie Out of Africa was well done but not overdone. Well worth a visit.",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed seeing round the Museum. Our guide was most interesting and charming and I loved seeing reproductions of Karen's paintings, her kitchen and panelled dining room. A pity that the shop has so little to sell. The house is simple but elegant...",
          "Went to the museum on the advice of a friend. This is a must see. The tour guides are amazing and you learn so much in addition to see Karen\u2019s beautiful house.",
          "We enjoyed the very informative tour we had and it was great to see for ourselves the house and farm where the movie was shot and where Karen lived.",
          "I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills\u2026 ok if you have no clue what that pertains to, you probably don\u2019t need to go to the Museum. However if you are a fan of the book or movie just go. It is a little run down and could be presented better but a visit is still",
          "Some reviews made us a little leery but not only the sunshine enhanced our visit. Our guide Benjamin was enthusiastic, well prepared but natural in his presentation. Our tour was unhurried but never flagged and questions were answered knowledgeably. Not being able to take photos",
          "As a Dane it was very intresting to visit that museum. They guide was good, but he did not know everything of Karens Danish history, but nice to visit the place,",
          "This lady was amazing. Her paintings, her home, the grounds, her furniture were all so very beautiful.",
          "We toured the Karen Blixen House/Museum in just about an hour. The house has been re-fitted with many of her items and other period appropriate pieces. The grounds and the view is lovely. We walked out to the burned remains of the coffee roasters from when the farm was",
          "So nice to remember this place where last time I went 25 years ago I was really happy to discover again this beautiful garden, this house I feel like nostalgic of the old time",
          "Great property and it is where Out of Africa was filmed. A lot of history here and a great tour too. Very cool house.",
          "The house is the one used in the movie and is exactly as described in the book. The tour was a bit silly though. The house is filled with things that might have been the types of things she had. There are prints of paintings done by her. It was rather pricy, and I could have",
          "We stopped here on our way to the airport so that we could see the house from the outside as we did not have time to do a tour on this visit to Nairobi. We walked onto the grounds from the parking lot, stood outside the house and did a couple of pictures of ourselves. We",
          "I enjoyed my trip to this house and had a very knowledgeable guide but it was a little disappointing that most of the furniture is replica and not original and it would have been great to be able to take photo's inside the house. The tour can be completed in less than an hour so",
          "Brilliant. Cost $13. Personal guide though. Value for money in my book. Lots of her possessions. Well presented. Authentic. Really enjoyed the visit. Allow an hour.",
          "Despite the small size of the museum itself the surroundings, including the must see nature trail, create a great Nairobi experience.",
          "I thought the tour was very thorough and well worth the time. We also ate lunch twice in the Blixen facility which was very well done.",
          "I visited the museum last month and had contradictory feelings about it. On the one hand, we had an extremely nice and sweet guide who was knowledgeable about the place and Blixen. I think the place is well presented and absolutely worth the visit. On the other hand, I have",

          "Visited this well known museum during a visit to the larger Karen area of Nairobi. The house itself is well kept but the entry fee I thought was higher than should be considering the Elephant orphanage only charges sh 500. Why this museum should cost more is beyond me..",

It was opened to the general public by the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta on 23 May 1969. It contains an artificial lake, several national monuments, and an assembly ground which has become a popular skateboarding spot on weekends and also a location for local skateboarding competitions (best trick contest 2017), catering to Nairobi's growing skate scene.Apart from skateboarding, the assembly ground is used for occasional political and religious gatherings. It is infamous as the site where protest against illegal land grabbing was violently broken up by the Moi regime.\nIn 1989, Wangari Maathai and many of her followers held a protest at the park, attempting to stop the construction of the 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust business complex. She was forced by the government to vacate her office and was vilified in parliament, but her protests and the government's response led foreign investors to cancel the project.In August 1996, a group led by a Catholic cardinal and Archbishop Maurice Michael Otunga burned a heap of condoms in Uhuru Park.Uhuru Park was the scene of a bomb blast in June 2010, which killed six people and left over 100 people injured. The attack targeted a \"NO\" campaign rally for the forthcoming constitutional referendum.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region. Successful artists based in Nairobi include Jua Cali, Nonini, Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and Nameless. Popular Record labels include Ogopa DJs, Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, Calif Records and Bornblack Music Group.\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi.

Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.\nNairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in Kenya producing DJs as well as producers like Jack Rooster, Euggy, DJ Fita, Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM. Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including Diplo, Major Lazer, Kyau & Albert, Solarity, Ronski Speed, and Boom Jinx.\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations. These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5 As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.Gospel music is also very popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artistes having a great impact in the mostly Christian city. Artistes such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, have a great pull over the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat have great influence over the younger generation. Their concerts are also very popular and they have as much influence as the great secular artistes. The most popular are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.\nMusical group Sauti Sol performed for U.S. President Barack Obama when he was in the city for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the Moi International Sports Centre in the suburb of Kasarani. The complex was completed in 1987, and was used to host the 1987 All Africa Games. The complex comprises a 60,000 seater stadium, the second largest in the African Great Lakes (after Tanzania's new national stadium), a 5,000 seater gymnasium, and a 2,000 seater aquatics centre.The Nyayo National Stadium is Nairobi's second largest stadium renowned for hosting global rugby event under the \"Safaricom Sevens.\" Completed in 1983, the stadium has a capacity of 30,000.

Nairobi Gymkhana is the home of the Kenyan cricket team, and was a venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Notable annual events staged in Nairobi include Safari Rally (although it lost its World Rally Championship status in 2003), Safari Sevens rugby union tournament, and Nairobi Marathon.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the city by viewership and participation. This is highlighted by the number of football clubs in the city, including Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards, Tusker and Mathare United.\nThere are six golf courses within a 20 km radius of Nairobi. The oldest 18-hole golf course in the city is the Royal Nairobi Golf Club.

There are also Muslim mosques including Jamia Mosque.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe majority of schools follow either the Kenyan Curriculum or the British Curriculum. There is also International School of Kenya and Rosslyn Academy, both of which follow the North American Curriculum, Swedish school in N'gong, and the German school in Gigiri.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nNairobi is home to several Universities and Colleges.\n\nThe University of Nairobi is the largest and oldest university in Kenya. It was established in 1956, as part of the University of East Africa, but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.South Eastern Kenya University is a constituent college of the University of Nairobi.\nKenyatta University is situated 16 km (9.9 mi) from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\nStrathmore University started in 1961 as an Advanced Level (UK) Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\nUnited States International University \u2013 Nairobi was originally a branch of the United States International University, but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\nIn 2005, The Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nThe Catholic University of Eastern Africa located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\nThe Technical University of Kenya (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only Technical University in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by Mwai Kibaki in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies.\nKCA University (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\nThe Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\nPan African Christian University is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\nEast Africa Institute of Certified Studies (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\nCompugoal College\nRiara University on Mbagathi road.\nUmma University is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.Numerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899. A population projection in the 21st century is listed below.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nNairobi is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "The Nairobi Railway Museum is a railway museum in Nairobi, Kenya, adjacent to Nairobi railway station.  Containing exhibits from the defunct East African Railways, it was opened in 1971 by East African Railways and Harbours Corporation. It is operated by Kenya Railways.\n\nThe museum has maintained its rail connection. This allows for the efficient movement of museum exhibits for maintenance and placing items in the collection.\nThe three operational steam locomotives are stored securely under cover within the main railway works. Visitors must request an appointment to view them. They have not been used for several years. One of the display locomotives, 301 (2301) was used in the 1985 movie, Out of Africa.\nThe museum's collection also includes early diesel locomotives and passenger coaches. Friends of the Railway Museum East Africa (FORM East Africa), a concern encompassing Railway and Locomotive enthusiasts, has assisted in sourcing and securing artifacts for the museum.In January 2011, a working miniature railway was installed to enhance activity at the museum. This miniature train was formerly used to promote Kenya Railways (KR) on exhibitions, such as the Nairobi Show. It consists of a locomotive with a petrol-engine, and several coaches made of wood.\n\n\n== Exhibited locomotives ==\nThe museum exhibits a number of engines, including:\n\nThe museum's W.G. Bagnall engine, Hugh F Marriott, was built in Stafford, England, in 1951. It operated as a switcher at the Magadi Soda Company until 1970. *301 was used in the 1985 Movie, Out of Africa (film).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNairobi Railway Museum, Facebook page",

          "You get the feeling that little has changed here for years. Some interesting curiosities of East African railways (not just Kenya) are displayed, but it's all a bit dull. It just feels like rather hard work to search out the best exhibits. Getting there: my guidebook indicated",
          "I used to play here as a kid and it simply has not changed much at all. the old Hand cart I played on with my sibling 30 years ago is still there and still working.. Dusty old tired artifacts, rusting engines and lots and lots of history.. I have an affinity for the place, its",

          "If one were a real trains buff, perhaps this \"museum\" would have been more interesting than it was to me. Other than a large and unorganized room full of materials and photographs, the museum consists of a number of train cars and engines sitting outside in the weather, slowly",

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya.

It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\nStrathmore University started in 1961 as an Advanced Level (UK) Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\nUnited States International University \u2013 Nairobi was originally a branch of the United States International University, but became a fully autonomous university in 2005.

The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899. A population projection in the 21st century is listed below.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nNairobi is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "I have seen review where people say you should negotiate a price about half of the asking price. This is useless. The vendors are very good at \"reading\" you and might start with a price 4 or 5 times what they are willing to sell.. My only tip. State the price you want to pay",

        "wiki": "Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife.\nDespite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew\u2014it had 14,000 residents by 1910\u2014conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe park covers an area of 117.21 km2 (45.26 sq mi) and is small in comparison to most of Africa's national parks. The park's altitude ranges between 1,533 and 1,760 m (5,030 and 5,774 ft). It has a dry climate. The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem. The park has a diverse range of habitats and species.The park is located about 7 km (4.3 mi) from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe park's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include African buffalo, baboon, eastern black rhinoceros, gazelle, Grant's zebra, cheetah, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotamus, African leopard, lion, common eland, impala, Masai giraffe, ostrich, vultures and waterbuck.Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.\n\nThe David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means \"Rhinoceros Sanctuary\". It is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nMervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.\n\n\n== Tourism and education ==\nNairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week.The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrett, Michael; Christine Riley (1995).

          "Very enjoyable and costs only $5, it's open between 11 and 12. Get there well before 11AM . They are doing fantastic work and you can even adopt a baby elephant",
          "I\u2019m so glad we went here! A lady on my Instagram recommended this place to me so off we went! The place is amazing, the guy telling the stories about all the elephants was lovely. You could see he was really passionate about what he was talking about and not just rhyming it off",
          "Absolutely wonderful - this is a must visit place when in Nairobi - saw two groups of baby elephants being fed by their carers - the elephants are amazing and there is narration throughout giving you loads of information about how they ended up in the orphanage and how they are",
          "Been several times and it's always so good. The babies are so cute. It never gets old. The sun can get a little hot sometimes but there is some shade, though not much. If you can, go during the week, perhaps not during school holidays if at all avoidable as it can get busy. But",
          "Was good to see the elephants and spend some time with them. You dont get alot of alone time with them but that's totally understandable",
          "This was added on to our tour last minute and I'm so glad that change was made! We learned a lot about the elephants while observing them playing and being fed. I was actually able to pet a baby elephant and his skin didn't feel like I thought it would. I'm not quite sure what I",
          "David Sheldrick Wildlife is interesting because you are getting a lot of information about elephant and how they treat them, you can ask as many questions as you want. The only thing is that there are too many people around the elephant and only one hour to see them",
          "We enjoyed the hour spent and thought the information given was interesting. Great experience for all ages, but most little kids will have trouble staying interested the entire hour. Was so glad to get there in person after following on Instagram",
          "We had the privilege of visiting the orphanage as adopters. It was fantastic to actually see and learn up close and personally the amazing work done here. I think my favorite part was walking around and observing the elephants as they settled into their routines. They each had",
          "Donate $50 to adopt a baby elephant and you get to visit your baby elephant (and all other baby elephants) at 5pm daily. It's for a good cause and absolutely worth it! I got to pet my baby elephant, a one year old (Roho) who was rescued after his mom was killed by poachers.",
          "I went to the DSWT as part of a 3-stop day trip from Nairobi. The site opens to the public only from 11 to 12, hence you need to plan accordingly. Once on the site, you are provided with explanations about each elephant, the orphanage and the mission which, to my opinion, is",
          "Love the elephant orphanage! It\u2019s a must see in Nairobi , they have a talk and explain everything they do for orphaned elephants and explain the name of each elephant and how they came to be there, they help them grow up socialise with wild elephants to help release them back",
          "It was so nice to visit the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust - they open at 11 for one hour while they feed the elephants. The elephants are only babies so they are extremely adorable and playful. If you stand close to the rope barriers you can sometimes touch them. The staff give",
          "I went to Sheldrick after adopting one of their baby elephants -- it was an amazing experience to see the elephants up close, learn about the work they are doing, and talk to the truly saintlike men who care for these special creatures. Each elephant has its own keeper; they",
          "The David Sheldrick elephant orphanage is a must see and a great way to start your visit to Kenya. The love and care that goes into taking care of the baby elephants is amazing. I had chills when the baby elephants came out. The visit is only an hour but it\u2019s enough to watch and",
          "In the 1940s, the husband and wife team of David and Daphne Sheldrick helped set up the Tsavo National Park. They were among the pioneers of wildlife conservation in Kenya, and the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was set up on the outskirts of Nairobi, abutting the countryside, to",

          "This place was pretty cool! Only $5 and worth it IMO. They have 2 groups of elephants that come out and you\u2019ll have the chance to pet the elephants if they come near you. My tip is to get there early and stand near one of the mud/water puddles. May get a little dirty, but it\u2019s",
          "Much has been said already, so here's what our experience was like at the adopter visit: For ~US$50 you can adopt an orphan for a year, and this qualifies you to have an adopter visit separate from the standard 11a feeding experience. It does need to be booked in advance, you",
          "Great to see orphan elephants being rescued, cared for, and released back into the wild. Feeding time is at around 11am, after which the show is over, but it\u2019s fun to watch the young elephants feed from the bottle.",
          "Visiting these gentle giants is one of my favourite things to do in Nairobi. The Trust is well organised with strict visiting hours (currently 1 hour every day from 11am for public and 1 hour every day - subject to advance booking from 5pm for visitors who have adopted the",

          "The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust does amazing work caring for orphaned baby elephants all the way until they are old enough to be returned to the wild. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the elephant sanctuary. It is clear that this is a true sanctuary and not a money making gimmick. We enjoyed seeing the elephants and hearing their stories.",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit to see and learn about baby elephants. And the money for your visit helps rescue and reintroduce elephants to the wild. A special place!",
          "Wonderful spot! We adopted an orphaned elephant and went to the 5 pm session. The parade of orphaned elephants was fantastic! Don\u2019t be late. Reservations required.",
          "Not only cause it\u2019s a great experience but also a great cause. Should be compulsory on all Kenya visits!!",
          "We visited whilst in Nairobi ( ironically immediately before starting a long safari) It\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or so. The staff are doing great work And the baby elephants are so so cute.",
          "I was completely overwhelmed with this amazing place. Despite the rain we had a lovely hour falling totally in love with all these gorgeous animals. This charity does the most phenominal work and it was very interesting hearing all the back stories of all the babies. Highlight",
          "A interesting experience for learning about elephants and the problems in the wild life; it\u2019s fun too",
          "What a special place! I had adopted an elephant and was able to go to the 5pm feeding and bedtime. It was nice because there was only about 25-30 of us. We were able to see the elephants run into the stockades (so adorable), as well as watch them eat, and speak to their",
          "I learned about the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust through one of my favorite tea brands that make these wonderful elephant tea tins. So, when I knew we were going to be nearby the Trust, I wanted to make sure to check it out. It was a fantastic experience. And an ideal thing to",

          "We really loved the experience and the beautiful babies. Great job to the caregivers and the David Sheldrick foundation.",
          "It was a brief hour-long visit we drove to via Uber. The main focus of the center is not tourism, but animal rehabilitation. We received a solid description of the roles performed by the trust over PA while the elephants walked near the visitors. It was excellent to see",
          "Really nice to see the small elephants being taken care of in such a magnificent way. Well worth a visit when in Nairobi.",
          "It\u2019s actually okay. For real conservation education, much better to go to Ole Pajeta near Nanyuki. Took my preschool boys. They liked it the first time but weren\u2019t interested in going back after seeing real families in the Tsavo and the conservation projects at ole pajeta.",
          "Good place to go to understand how they are looking after the elephant orphans, and ensuring they get back into the wild. Yes a bit of a queue, but they do well to get you all in, and its managed so that it doesn't impact the elephants. Worth a trip if you are visiting the area.",
          "Quite informative and interesting attraction , but the management of the trust has failed to offer commensurate facilities to the visiting tourists either by default or lack of interest. The entrance to the orphanage is quite a haphazard affair due lack of planning. Instead of",
          "I have been a long time supporter of this organization, and will continue to be as long as I\u2019m standing and breathing! The work they have done, not only in rescuing elephant orphans, but many other animals, is just astonishing! Their commitment to helping stave off poachers",
          "What they are doing here is a wonderful thing, but not the best tourist experience with it being so many people in such a small space. If you get there at least an hour early, it would greatly enhance the experience, but otherwise I'd spend your time elsewhere.",
          "Elephant orphanage was very fun. Very crowded but our guide took us right to the front and knew where to stand to see the best and get to pet the elephants. Also fed giraffes and took us to an interesting out of the way restaurant. Great day.",
          "We adopted 2 baby elephants prior to our visit to Nairobi (we are big supporters of wildlife rescue groups--and were intrigued by the idea of meeting our \"babies\" in person!). After we adopted our babies--Maktao and Kiasa--I contacted Sheldrick to set up a visit with other",

          "Love, is the first feeling when you see the gentle giants in front of you. So large yet so playful. Just like human children, they are mischievous and playful too and they want your attention. The orphanage takes good care of these elephant calves and unlike others I have been",
          "An interesting and informative visit. Lots of opportunity to take photos. Make sure you arrive early to get a good viewing spot as it can get very busy",
          "Make this a part of your Nairobi to do list. When those babies come charging down the hill to get their bottles, it\u2019s hilarious! And the staff does a tremendous job telling you about the individual babies and how they ended up there. You get to be close enough to touch them; oh",
          "Viewing the elephant orphanage is a different experience from the Safaris and national parks. You get to hear the story of the orphaned elephants and it's quite moving. They are so cute as they play in the red mud. It really made me and my family feel more compassion for",

          "Visited here and saw the baby elephants that have been saved from a variety of unfortunate situations some natural, some man made. The 1 hour that it opens every day means inevitably it is very busy but the sight of the elephants was very special for my kids who have adopted one",

          "What wonderful work this place and people do! The visit was very worth while, very educating and opening peoples eyes to the fight against ivory markets. So sad to know that all the little elephants were left orphaned because of mankind in some way. At the same time we were so",
          "We visited in the morning where we learnt a lot about the elephant orphans, and were also entertained by a warthog that sneaked in between the elephants. Since we a adopted a rhino, we were also able to make the afternoon visit which is a very different experience where you see",
          "Very interesting, the explanations are quite good and the baby elephants so 'cute'! Very nice experience. I recommend",
          "A must see if you are in Nairobi. Orphaned elephants are hand raised fr up to 4 years when they are relocated back into the bush. Wonderful experience.",

          "This was a fantastic experience. The Elephant orphanage is just fun to watch. The elephants run out to meet their care takers, who stay with them until they are release to the wild AND accepted into an elephant herd. They have special milk they feed the elephants. And, you",
          "The trip is only for an hour. Two groups of young elephants come into the ring, are fed, play around for a bit and then go out again. They are lovely and some great photo opportunities Very worthwhile work being done here.",
          "This was just about ok. If you have already seen elephants earlier there is nothing here...Just a few baby elephants who come up to drink milk..Of course the important message is the good stuff they are doing for abandoned elephants..Personally I did not find anything great",
          "To see these magnificent animals, orphaned for r natural or subversive reasons, being cared for until they can return to the wild warmed my heart. I observed the obvious dedication of the staff to their charges as they raise them to an age where they can be transferred to",
          "If you have the time this is a stop worth your time. This facility for years has been caring for and releasing orphaned elephants. An opportunity to get up close and personal with baby elephants. The staff are incredibly dedicated to the task of caring for these noble creatures.",

          "Thought this might be a nice was to spend a few hours in Nairobi, but boy was i wrong. Better go to a zoo in your home town than be herded like elephants (pun intended) to this second rate tourist spot. Maybe they are doing a nice thing, but it seems like a hustle for tourist",
          "I am very pleased we went to the sanctuary. The work being done in saving the baby elephants at risk is wonderful. Elephants are released to Tsavo Park once old enough to survive. The visit was very informative and enjoyable.",

          "You need to get there well before feeding to secure a good vantage point. I found some late arrivals were very aggressive at pushing to the front and displacing early arrivals, hence my rating of good rather than excellent. Once the babies start coming down it is wonderful to",
          "Get there at least an hour before the feeding and don't trust later arrivals to politely sit behind early arrivals. You definitely want to be at the front of the herd for pics and perhaps a chance to pet one of the orphans.",
          "I have been wanting to visit this place since I first learned of it some years ago. I adopted a baby and met him and it was magical.",
          "Very moving to watch these baby orphans who have been traumatized (mothers killed, lost, sick) being cared for by keepers so they can be returned to the wild and live a natural life. While the keepers feed the elephants, an informative and educational presentation is given so",
          "The orator was very knowledgeable, provided very useful insight and encouraged questions from the audienct. Tip: arrive early so that you can get right next to the rope fence and you will likely be able to touch small elephants as they walk by",
          "This place is wonderful. I encourage everyone to watch the movie, Born to Be Wild as this video really encompasses what you will be seeing at the Sheldrick Wildlife center. Wonderful opportunity to see baby elephants, a giraffe, and a rhino. There are warthogs wondering around",
          "They do such important work here, and there is so much to learn about Kenyan wildlife, the needs of baby elephants, and what it takes to save the environment from further destruction. Highly recommended, and do yourself a favour, sponsor one or more of the elephants so you get",
          "This is a total reap off. They are just making money in the name of conservation. Very disappointing.",
          "What a fun morning we had at the orphanage! The baby elephants are such a delight, playing in the mud, teasing each other, trumpeting...I could watch them for hours! We also thought that we were given a lot of important information by the keeper who was doing the presentation",
          "Let me preface this review with the fact that I have read all of Dame Daphne Sheldrick\u2019s books and am a foster of several elephants here. Needless to say it was a dream come true for me to visit this orphanage and it did not disappoint. They bring the baby elephants out in two",
          "Wonderful experiance where you can see your dollar going into conservation, which is rare in Africa. Its usually directed who knows where. Great to see so many animals being cared for pproperly",

          "A worthwhile cause to help the Elephants has turned in to a big tourist attraction but not without problems. It was a pretty hot day, no shade and no where to sit. Standing 4 deep around the enclosure was useless as far a seeing anything. Disappointingly an uncomfortable waste",
          "Having been a supporter of Sheldrick Wildlife Trust for a decade, I cannot speak highly enough of the organization. In addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and returning to the wild orphaned elephants, rhinos and giraffes, they also work with Kenya Wildlife Service to remove",
          "The only way to see elephants in Nairobi. They get some milk and you get to hear how the orphanage and the process of adopting one elephant work. That's about it. Very crowded as it is only open for 1h. It costs 600ks, only cash, but they also accept euro and usd.",
          "Have visited multiple times over the past decade. It's very nice to see how the orphaned elephants are cared for by the dedicated staff. Very nice to adopt an elephant and get the monthly (?) email, which is basically a standard, default, piece of text with the name of \"your\"",
          "If you sponsor an elephant (great cause to support) and book in advance, you can visit in the early evening as the elephants are coming home to go to bed. Its a joy to see them so happy - running back from the national park to their stables where dedicated keepers are waiting",

          "I read Dame Sheldrik's Biography before I went to Kenya and suggest that ALL of the adults reading this do, too. It fills in, actually overflows, the goodness of her spirit that saved so many infant animals and teaches us to continue following her example. There can be nothing",
          "We almost didn't visit this foundation because I had felt like it was going to be too 'touristy'. Yes, there are plenty of tourists watching the elephants eat, play, and bathe. But it was just so interesting to see the young elephants interact with each other and to learn",
          "Went to see the how well the Elephants were looked after and was not disappointed. !4 young elephants kept at the trust which will be returned to the wild when they are ready. The trust is only opened for an hour so there is not a lot of interaction with humans.",

          "It\u2019s worth to go there, just t see the elephant babies and get the information about the elephants and the orphanage. Come min. 1/2 hour earlier, normally is quite crowded. If it\u2019s raining, be prepared to stand in deep mud.",
          "This is a must do in Nairobi where you get up close and personal with the baby elephants and see how they interact. Start lining up early like 10:15 or 10:30 if you want to get a good spot. They only open at 11am daily for 1-2 hours. you get to possibly touch an elephant if you",

          "These baby elephants bring a smile and a tear to your eye at the same time - about losing a mom but getting great care now and a future chance to return to the wild. Can\u2019t help feeling happier after seeing them. Opportunity to adopt one for $50 US to see how their life",
          "This is an amazing experience. The Sheldrick Trust raises orphaned elephants until they can go back to the wild. I foster 3 babies so was able to visit them in the evening when they come back from the bush with their keepers. I highly recommend visiting the Sheldrick elephant",
          "The reviews are all true! I adopted an elephant (Musiara) a few years ago with the goal of making it here for my 50th birthday. We had a whole day planned around the Karen area and this was Number 1 for me. We went for the 11AM visit - it was so great to see all the young",

          "What these people do is simply amazing. These poor orphans who are supported until they are able to get back to a protected area is loving work. It is amazing to learn about these elephants. Touch them. See them. Talk to their keepers. And to support them is just a few dollars",
          "I know this place for the past 25 years so my memories from the past were better. The Sheldricks ladies did a fantastic job over these years taking care of the orphans. Sadly, it became a very commercial place, with hundreds of obnoxious tourists. However, still worth to",
          "We visited our 3 baby elephants and one rhino, Dololo, Kiasa, Musiara and Maxwell. It was lovely seeing them race into the compound to their respective keepers for the bedtime milk. Maxwell, the rhino is blind so was in his compound already. We had an hour with our little",

          "Our guide got us an amazing spot to view this activity. Although people were told to keep quiet they continued to make lots of noise so was a bit difficult sometimes to hear the commentry. That aside, it was great seeing the work that is done and being that close to the",

          "I very much enjoyed my visit to Sheldrick, scratched and rubbed young, orphan elephants trunks and ears. Very good, instructional lecture by curators. Only matter is that the place is (deservedly) quite popular, so it was rather crowded when I visited. Great for children. Photos",

          "We recently spent the morning with the elephants during their daily hour of visitation. The elephants were adorable and the information provided by the keepers was spot on. These people are doing incredible work and we love being apart of helping their achieve their goals. They",
          "Amazing and sad at the same time. The elephants are amazing and the information regarding their rescues is heartwarming.",
          "The dedication if this team to demonstrate how precious every life is was humbling. Having a facility to rescue animals in need is awesome. Loved and fell in love with the babies. And have now adopted one - a small contribution to a huge task.",
          "The organization does great work in rescuing & rehabbing orphaned baby elephants. They are so adorable to watch as they drink milk from elephant sized bottles and play while the keeper tells us the history of each of the elephants. Some are very happy to meet & greet the",
          "Our tour guide for this 5 Star private tour to the Elephant Orphanage and Giraffe Center was Simba. I totally recommend the tour and Simba. We had a most memorable day! The orphanage was our first close up view of baby elephants. Simba led us to front row viewing even though",
          "Go, you will love it. You see how elephants are being feed, you can touch baby elephants, you can adopt one...it is great to see these animals so close",
          "Have never done anything around Nairobi before. This was a new experience. The place is well kept and the animals looked content. Ofcourse nothing beats the wild but this was probably close enough.",
          "What an amazing thing they are doing. It was so nice to be so up close to baby elephants and know about how they were rescued. Highly recommend visiting this place. Try to get there early so you can be up front and touch the baby elephants.",
          "Really up close viewing of baby orphaned elephants taking their milk bottles, playing football, messing in the water. Great photo opportunities. Really informative talk. No seating. Get there early to get best views.",
          "Lovely to see all the baby elephants running back from the national park for their evening feed. Nice to see them up close in their nighttime pens some social enough that they interact with you. We adopted an elephant prior to our visit which allowed us the opportunity to visit",
          "We went along in the afternoon as I adopt an elephant orphan and at this time you get to see them come back in from the park to have their milk and go to bed. The sight of them all running back in from the trees was the cutest thing I've ever seen! You can chat to the keepers",
          "An informative one hour that is worth every penny. The good thing is that the rescued elephants are reintegrated into the wild. One can also adopt an elephant.",
          "This is something you will not see on safari...lots of baby elephants orphaned as the result of poachers for the most part. Come early when they open, as it gets very crowded and hard to get close.",
          "Such cute orphans with heart breaking stories. A must visit for anyone. Total eye opener to placing and other dangers to wildlife",
          "Great, he did a wonderful job. Great driver, respectful, and very accommodating. He went along with our timing and helped us solve problem. We really liked Alex.",
          "It was a very heart warming experience to visit the sheldricks orphanage for elephants and see the wonderful baby elephants and very happy to see that they are taken care of by the people there",
          "This is a very nice place to visit and learn about the conservation efforts being undertaken to save the lives of endangered elephants. I recommend.",
          "This has to be the most adorable place in Nairobi. Where else do you get to see baby elephants run around, play with each other, and feed off a bottle WHILE learning about elephants and supporting this non profit organization? They are only open 11am-12pm, so visiting does",
          "We enjoyed it! It\u2019s only open between 11am-12 pm and it\u2019s super popular with lots of visitors/ tourists so make sure you get in the queue early so that you get a good spot to see the baby elephants getting fed! Went here 10 yrs ago and it wasn\u2019t nearly as busy and you also got",
          "We visited here as part of a day trip around Nairobi. We imagined this would be busy, but not as busy as it actually was. Whilst being busy isn\u2019t a bad thing, it did mean that being able to see the baby elephants was a bit of a problem as we weren\u2019t the first people there. So if",
          "If you wish to be able to have a close encounter with the elephants make sure you arrive early and are at the front of the queue when the gates open. Find your way to the front of the lines opposite of where the elephants are released from, away from the dirt mounds. it gets",
          "Well this is a terrific place. Make sure to donate and adopt an elephant and then you can join the other donors at the 5pm visit time (only an hour), but it is a wonderful time. The baby elephants come running out and you can spend time, take pictures and enjoy their company.",
          "A must stop for anyone coming to Nairobi. This is the closest that the will come to an elephant that is not take, and you are contributing to a god cause.",
          "After 11 days of safari and seeing well over 100 elephants, we weren't sure we needed to go to the \"Elephant Orphanage\". However, as we watched the \"babies\" run by on the way to their feeding rituals, we were inspired and glad we came. The opportunity to \"adopt\" an elephant for",
          "We had time to kill in Nairobi and took Uber to the elephant orphanage for the one hour presentation which was fun and educational. I recommend this.",
          "This is probably the must-see venue to visit on a trip through Nairobi. The work of the trust is so important, rescuing and later rewilding orphaned elephants from across Kenya. Visiting is strictly between 11am and noon, and is very popular (so aim to arrive by 10.30 to be",
          "So cool. Wish it was longer! We didn't do the extra adoption and should have! My wife got real close and touched a baby. See was in heaven.",
          "Come early to get in front of the line since you want to be in front to see the baby orphan elephants. There is an outdoor area with mounds of dirt that is roped off around it where you stand to see the elephants. There are also raised concrete platforms in the back for the",
          "Great place to go as part of a full day trip. They only open from 11-12 and the que is big so I would suggest booking via a company as this meant less queuing time for us (We went with Natural World Kenya Safari) I was apprehensive about visiting an \u2018orphanage\u2019 when you hear so",
          "What a wonderful place to visit to experience the rescue and rehabilitation of baby elephants. It's great that such a place exists and can be experienced by all.",
          "Elephant lovers will like the Nairobi Nursery. A better experience is staying at one of the integration units, of course, for a much higher price. For an hour with elephants, I'd sponsor one for $50 in order to be one of only 75 allowed in the facility at the 5pm visitation.",
          "OH my, to go to this wonderful orphanage of young elephants is a chance to have some optimism for the future of elephants. To see these young elephants come running when it is bottle time, is pure bliss! These young elephants would not have made it in the wild without help.Now",
          "Wonderful visit to see and hear about baby elephants and their life and the walkable work that the try\u2019s does to keep them going.",
          "We visited few months ago and it was a lot of fun to watch and learn about the baby elephants. There was also a two month old rhino when we visited. Fantastic job that David Sheldrick Wildlife trust is doing. The entrance fee is 500 shillings for everyone regardless of your",
          "The Sheldrick centre only opens for tourists for one hour a day, so that their primary focus remains on the care of the orphaned elephants. During this one hour visit, we were able to hear the stories of the orphaned elephants and watch them feed with their keepers. There",
          "There are two times a day to see the elephants: at 11:00am and at 5:00pm. Go online and adopt a baby elephant for $50 and you and your family can come in at the later time. It is not nearly so crowded and you can see the babies in their cribs. If they come over to the door,",
          "Was so amazing to see these beautiful animals being cared for. Yes it's only an hour to view but it was worth it, seeing the baby elephants running in to get their bottles of milk and then playing with each other. The talk given was very informative and the gentleman answered",
          "Disappointed by the presence of large crowds and not much else apart from a handful of stall selling merchandise. Would have liked to see or hear about conservation and associated activities",
          "I was so excited to see the baby elephants that we visited twice: Once during the public viewing hours from 11 am to 12 pm and again for the private adopter's visit from 5 to 6 pm, which we arranged in advance. For the public viewing, make sure you arrived at least 30-45 minutes",
          "The work that this place does is saving elephants is great, but they really need to improve the way the public are allowed to see the elephants. The place is only open 1 hr a day and to see the elephants one has to be there at the opening. This is because you crowd round a",
          "nothing like a Safari - but excellent - the Baby Elephant Walk was the BEST!! The rest felt like a close up zoo, but still seeing the animals enclosed",
          "The only daily showing of young elephants happens at 11 am. Arrival is needed earlier to achieve a good standing viewing position near the roped off area. The hour talk as different aged groups came to the area, some running was very informative. The huge milk bottles being fed",
          "So precious! Make sure you go early to get in line. There are only so many places at the front of the ropes unobstructed. You can let the little ones sneak in front lol. The orphans are amazing. What a start to an an an amazing day.",
          "Out of all of the sanctuaries and rescues we visited on this trip, this is one I have zero doubts about. research this place before you go if you are concerned; it is well known and you find out a lot about it. It is a shelter where they rescue orphaned elephants from all over",
          "We turned up for the 11am show which was highly informative with information on how the group of elephants became orphans. The first lot of 7 baby elephants were adorable, running over to get their milk. If you are lucky, you get to touch them as they wander round towards the",
          "Learned about elephant orphans. Got to watch the feeding, pet them and handfed with branches. One can further help out by adopting an elephant. I picked a pathetic looking one that was new to the center. They are doing a great job in caring for animals and raising awareness.",
          "The center is very respectful of the animals - it's not a \"show\" yet at the same time it's really magical to be able to pet a baby elephant. We loved watching them.",
          "At first I thought it strange the place was only open from 11am to 12 noon, but once I arrived I understood why that was plenty of time. The elephants come to a viewing area while guests come and go. A man explained the purpose of the trust and spoke about the elephants. The",
          "Great place to visit while in Nairobi The experience was outstanding, we loved to see the baby elephants fed. This wonderful organization was doing a great job ,who cares for orphaned elephants. It truly is a special experience..Highly recommended. We adopted two baby orphan",
          "We were able to insert a visit to this place on our last day of the trip. For 500 shillings, it was a for a good cause since they are helping orphaned elephants by feeding, nourishing and rehabilitating them before they are released to the wild again. It was an educational",
          "A great organization that helps orphaned elephants. Must be there well before 11 AM for the only feeding each day. A great hour spent in close proximity to these young animals.",
          "The day we visited the elephant orphanage as part of our day tour of Nairobi, it was so crowded and difficult to see what was going on. The visitor area cannot handle a large crowd so there is limited opportunity for people to interact with the elephants. The main focus seemed",
          "Wonderful to see all the baby elephants that are cared for so well by this centre. They are doing a great job, and to see them being fed, and to hear all about them is an experience not to be missed if visitng Nairobi.",
          "The young elephants were a delight to watch especially as they had such different personalities. Well worth a visit especially given the work they do to save orphaned elephants. However can get crowded and not much shade as you stand around for a while (including the long line",

          "Must get there 1 hour early to get a good spot. Huge crowds. Fun to see the babies. Your are allowed to touch them if they come up to the rope. Fun to watch them take their bottles",
          "The cuteness overload is enough to keep someone wanting to return. The baby elephants seem well taken care of and really happy not to mention how amazing the cause is itself",
          "It's amazing to see the nice side of humans at David Sheldricks... Not only did my family from abroad enjoy watching the elephants, but every time I visit, it makes me happy seeing the animals happy and secure. Watching them run for food, play around, and getting to bed! Not",
          "These animals appeared to be well trained. The staff are very caring and they provide great information about the elephants. It was a short visit but well worth it. I would highly recommend this place.",
          "Spent an hour here watching the elephants frolic and be fed their bottles. This place is only open for 1 hr daily. It is very busy. You have to line up before it opens and then walk quickly/run in to the area where the elephants come out and jockey for viewing position once the",
          "A wonderful visit. It was fun watching the elephants so up close... Great job rescuing and nurturing the gentle baby elephants",
          "The elephant trust Is only open for an hour each day so the number of tourists crowded into a relatively small viewing area can be a bit overwhelming. We visited as part of our tour and I'm glad we made it here. The handlers bring out about 2 baby elephants at a time in a fenced",
          "The shelter allows the public in from 11.00 am to 12.00 am for non-Trust members. Very reasonable price for non-residents. Excellent viewing point and sometimes you can touch some younger bolder elephants - but usual caveats - they are gentle but still wild animals! Watch out",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Nairobi. I will warn you the 11-12 touristy showing can be quite overwhelming and gobs of people, but it is worth going at least once. What I highly recommend is adopting an elephant for $50 for the year and book the bed down experience. Way",
          "Want to see baby orphan elephants in Nairobi. Then this is the place. It\u2019s allowed for Visitors only for an Hr. 11 AM - 12 PM. So make sure you reached before 11 AM, because the space is limited & you won\u2019t get a better view of elephants if you are late.",
          "Visited with my sister and found the place such a dedicated organisation supporting orphaned and injured baby elephants. We've both adopted an elephant after seeing the great work of the centre.",
          "Definitely worth going, even if you haven't sponsored an elephant. The babies are so sweet and you are allowed to pat them if they walk next to you. Plenty of opportunity for photos.",
          "Cannot tell you what a wonderful place this is to visit and see the wonderful way the people there are taking care of these orphan baby elephants! They have an adoption program that a person can give them $50 and they will send you monthly info on the Elephant you want to adopt.",
          "Impressed with the efforts taken to rescue and protect orphaned young elephants and then release into the wild.",
          "If you want to enjoy how baby elephants are fed by baby formula, I am sure their cuteness will put a smile on your face.",
          "This project is fantastic and needed. The elephants are charming and in need of care! The only downside is the logistics of adopting one; they could have had a LOT more participants if they'd been set up to handle visitors a little better. This didn't change the experience;",
          "My second time here and the teens loved the babies. I noted quite an an addition to the stock. Did adopt one elephant, would love to see her grow up and return to the wild. A good reason for me to visit again and again.",
          "These people are truly angels! Don't miss this place! And of course, adopt a baby elephant while you are there!",
          "The center is great but it seems it's grown in popularity but hasn't adjusted to the crowds. Long lines even on weekdays and inevitable selfish people cutting the lines. Once you get in make sure to carve space on the rope or you won't see much. I don't know, grateful for the",
          "I adopted 4 babies, and consider this a very important and worth while endeavor and will continue to support them. The DSWT rely on donations to care for these adorable little guys. The facility is well run with incredibly dedicated and caring staff. The work they do is very",
          "Having each adopted babies from home, we were able to come back in the evening to see them on a more personal level as they were getting ready to sleep. The caretakers are amazing and truly care for their charges. The trust is a place anyone should consider donating to.",
          "Amazing experience seeing the Elephants. We were lucky to get close to the ropes and saw some cheeky baby elephants. The elephants come running down the hill to get fed (large bottles of milk). They play about in the mud and provide a lot of entertainment. There is a talk which",
          "I have, and so have my kids. I LOVE going there with my family. I can never get enough of the baby elephants. Although the interaction with humans is short, 1 hour, it's worth it. The narrative about the circumstances that the brought the babies to the foundation always makes",
          "Superb Place. David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is doing a Great Job by supporting Orphan Elephant Babies. We found the Elephants playful and seeing them drinking Milk in Big Bottles. This place is very next to Nairobi National Park. The best time to visit is to make sure you",
          "Well worth a visit. We saw 13 baby elephants in two groups and were told their life stories and how they came to be at the elephant orphanage. Rather too many seem to get stuck down wells - perhaps an new well design is needed in the areas the elephants most often get trapped.",
          "Make sure you look at the material on the website in detail before you go, so you understand what this will be like. Many of the negative reviewers obviously didn't do their research. This is not a petting zoo, you don't get the opportunity to truly interact with the animals.",
          "Fabulous insight into the incredible work they do to help orphaned elephants. Well worth a visit. Be aware you can only visit between 11.00 and 12.00",
          "It\u2019s cute and nice being if you are going Safari skip it as you will see plenty in the Mara. It\u2019s best doing before safari rather than after as it will feel like an anticlimax. Only open hour a day so get ur timings right",
          "Best experience of my life. We got to do the private viewing at 5pm and got to hang out with the baby elephants one on one. Its an incredible thing they do for these elephants and so happy it exists.",
          "We visited the baby elephants along with 100\u2019s of others for the one hour opening of between 11-12. Was surprised by the long line when we arrived 1/2 before but the line moved quickly when the gates opened. The \u201cshow\u201d was just lovely. Baby elephants ran down from the nearby",
          "What a wonderful elephant orphanage,also home to an 11 year old blind rhino!!Hearing the narrator talk about each elephant's history and seeing them romp and play was a memorable experience.What a joy!!!!!!",
          "What a wonderful experience! We learned so much about the organization and each baby elephant. You must visit if you are going to Nairobi.",
          "We had a wonderful time at the Orphanage. The elephants were too cute and we were very impressed with the staff. I felt the carers are doing a great job balancing allowing the public to watch and learn about the elephants while also not exploiting the animals. When someone in",
          "My Husband and I stopped here before our long flight home back to the States and I must say it was a wonderful way to end our trip. They teach you about each elephant and its wonderful to know there are people out there to take care of these babies.Such a wonderful cause !",
          "As a foster parent to some of the orphans in care DSWT was naturally my first stop when I arrived in Nairobi. The public visit was a little overcrowded with tourists but if you arrive early enough you won\u2019t get stuck at the back of the line and will secure a good spot to watch",
          "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been saving orphaned elephants for decades. These dedicated, selfless people are saving those special animals, one life at a time. This is certainly a place to visit if you want to encounter elephants and even more, a place to support in their",
          "It was so wonderful to be up close and personal with these sweet babies. It was great to hear about this project. They care for these babies until they can be on their own and then release them to their natural habitat. Fantastic project",

          "This is well worth a trip if you have a morning in Nairobi. Everyone loves seeing baby elephants! It's only open from 11am to 12, but you'll want to be in the queue by 10.30am to guarantee a good spot. My advice is to go to the Giraffe Centre at 9am (1 hour is enough there) and",
          "The babies are so cute. You stand along a path as the run by to get to their pins for the night. Their keepers go with them to feed them milk and fresh greens. Some of the babies let you pet them, but not all. One really young one was down and asleep in minutes. It really is",
          "I have been an adopter for many years so a visit to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust area was on the top of my list. From the parking lot, there is a short walk to an area where one of the keepers gives an informative talk on their work. Elephants, in the morning, are",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful place and a really good experience. Being able to see baby elephants and older elephants so close is a true privilege. It\u2019s also nice how the mc explains the whole story behind each elephant.",
          "We booked a private driver to take us to the Orphanage and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was a great introduction to conservation efforts in Kenya and a chance to get up close and if lucky personal with these young elephants. Take some water and wear a hat if the sun is",
          "You have to be here at 11am for the 1 hour show of the baby elephants feeding. It\u2019s only on once per day. They are very cute and you get to pat them if they come close. The foundation does wonderful work in saving these beautiful animals.",
          "An exceptional place to visit, to see just how great the David Sheldrick team are. They take abandoned baby Elephants, attend to their health, and eventually return them to the wild. To get this close and personal to young elephants is a very special experience.",
          "We (my parents and I) went to the elephant orphanage for the hour-long elephant feeding visit. It was undeniably fun to see the elephants playing and draining their milk bottles in less than 20 seconds. For $5 each (plus a cheap Bolt or Uber ride) it was worth it. Just don't",
          "This wildlife orphanage it wonderful. We watched the babies come out to play and be fed from giant bottles. There was no performance, thank goodness, but there was an educational talk about their work. At the end of the presentation, one could support their special work by",
          "Make sure you donate before you go and then arrive at 5 to see your elephant up close being fed! It\u2019s truly a once in a lifetime experience to be here watching the elephants being cared for. Many return to the wild in 3 years!",

          "Worthwhile attraction, especially since it is so famous and everybody else raves about it. The downside is the crowd. Too many people. Arrive early, run and push. If you are late/slow then you won't get a spot along the rope, and you won't see as much. The baby elephants",
          "These baby elephants are fortunate enough to have been found and looked after by this trust. They only open for one hour from 11-12 and it is worth getting there early so that you get to touch and see the baby elies.",
          "This place is amazing. They have spent years saving so many animals, not just elephants. They fly over areas looking for animals hurt by poachers, farmers etc. they give medical care on the spot. If they spot a young animal without a family, they bring them back to their",
          "A very overcrowded place. I could hardly see the hour-long feeding program. It is for a wonderful cause.",
          "This place is definitely well worth a visit. The small entrance fee of 500 Kenyan Shillings per person goes towards the care of the orphaned elephants as well as funds from shop sales of souvenirs. There is also a chance to sponsor an orphan to maintain the trust's project.",
          "They are doing great work but it\u2019s still captivity. Donate to the cause but go on safari. Elephants in the wild are so prevalent there is no need to go other than to support them in their cause to save orphans",

          "Having read Daphne Sheldrick's book - Love, Life and Elephants, we knew a little about their Wildlife Trust and adopted rescued elephants prior to arriving. This allowed us to see the elephants during the hour set aside for the general public - but also to return later in the",

          "I visit Sheldrick Orphanage every time I am in Nairobi and I highly recommend a visit to this facility not only for the personal interaction it provides, but also for the opportunity one has to become a part of saving lives directly through conservation adoption. You can",
          "I had adopted 2 baby elephants before my trip to Nairobi. We went to the public viewing and then back again for the private viewing for those who adopted. It was awesome. The keepers are so loving and gentle with these baby orphans. It was heart warming to see & experience.",
          "We arrived at 10.15am and many people were gathering at the same time. Arriving early helps to gain a place at the rope so you're closer to the 14 baby elephants. Brilliant to see these animals so close and well looked after. Would highly recommend",
          "There are no words to describe it! Went twice, once for the foster parent visit and once for the morning public visit. They do incredible work!!",

          "This was an an amazing experience to watch 14 baby elephants up close for an hour. We got to watch them each have their bottle of milk and then play around together. If they came close enough we were able to stroke them and got some amazing pictures. I would advise arriving",
          "Heartwarming view of all the baby elephants who were rescued in the wild by this wildlife trust. Great presentation of the care of feeding of the babies, rehabilitation and ultimate release back into the wild.",
          "There is more to hear than to do or see. The bottom line is that the Trust is about salvaging deserted or injured baby elephants. You see them fed with big bottles of formula milk and hear more than you can do or see. If you have never been close to an elephant then it might",
          "A deal at just $5 (500 KSch), you will see between 15-30 baby elephants. They have been rescued from wells, poachers, and other tragedies. It is a great cause, informative, and fairly priced!",
          "We adopted two animals in advance and then were permitted a \u201cfoster parent\u201d visit in the late afternoon along with about 20 or 30 other folks. The grounds were immaculate and the men who care for the orphans are amazing, gentle souls. The baby elephants are obviously adorable",
          "you can only visit for 1 hour. People gather in line to get their place before the doors open. If you can hurry to the roped area and secure your place . People don't move once the elephants come out. The handlers do their best to give everyone along the ropes a chance to see",
          "The orphanage currently has 15 elephant orphans and they are the most adorable creatures. The centre is open at 11AM for public visits and if you are a foster parent of an orphan, you can book for your visit at 5PM (book early especially in July and August). You can see the",
          "If you love elephants and you want to have the chance to pet one and help to protect them this is the place to go. This place takes care of orphan elephants and the income allows them to provide all the necessary for their care. Amazing place to visit with kids.",
          "best done by adopting an elephant on their site and get the private 5 o'clock feeding invite. Very mindful and sanctuary places as all visitors really get this amazing nursery and treat it as such.",
          "Our family of 7 visited the Sheldrick elephant orphanage in July, 2019. The experience was informative and educational, but quite hot and crowded. If one could get close to the fence, it was possible to feed and stroke the baby elephants as they wandered past the crowd. The",
          "The place really is only open to visitors for an hour, but that is what's best for the animals. Apparently, you can buy into their special \"foster parent/adoption\" program and come during other times and see into their exclusive rehabilitation facility as well. Just about the",
          "Wish it had been more organized. Way too many people with limited viewing they should have two showings with limited numbers. It was chaos. I wish I could have really gotten close enough to see and touch the elephants better.",

          "This is a not-to-miss site if you are in Nairobi! They do such important work saving orphaned elephants ( and sometimes other animals), and returning them to the wild. Visitors may attend a daily presentation that showcases the baby elephants and the keepers explain the care",
          "Baby elephant orphanage started by David Sheldrick. Adorable baby elephants fed and taken care of here. Go before 11 am to see them being fed from large bottles.",
          "Fully enjoyed this park & presentation of the elephants and the work they do to bring them back to nature. Great to see them so up close, we were even able to touch them.",
          "The tip here is to stay to the end. The vast crowd thins out as the disinterested leave so you can get a decent view of these baby elephants. The work done by these keepers is magnificent to bring these wonderful animals to a place where they can go home to the reserves.",
          "Superb family fun to watch baby elephants play in the mud and dirt. The show runs from 11-12 each day, but you best arrive by 1030 to get ahead of the line...avoid going on weekends too as it will just be too crowded.",
          "The elephants are adorable, no doubt, but you must arrive very early to even see them properly. The orphanage only opens for one hour per day, which is rather commendable, so there is only one viewing. We could hardly see anything and our children quickly got bored (they were up",
          "Great place to stop while in Nairobi. It's a lot of fun, and the trainers are super knowledgeable. I recommend.",
          "We went to see the baby elephant feeding and there was quite a crowd. It was great to learn about the history of each elephant and the conservation efforts in place to ensure they\u2019re placed back in the wild. Super impressed.",
          "I adopted little Larro a few months before traveling to Kenya. I HAD to see her before leaving for home. We arranged a visit for fosters and it was fantastic. First, we see her and the other orphans running like wildfire for their dinner bottles, lol. Then we get to spent time",

          "It is not everyday that you see elephants so close that you actually touch them. And not only can you stay close to them for about an hour but you know that the fee for the entrance goes to protect those orphans who lost their mother to poachers or other reasons. We learned more",
          "Definitely would recommend! Elephants are so cute and the staff explained their stories and the story of the center. You may get a chance to pet an elephant. They also seem very well treated. Entrance for tourist is 5 dollars or 500 shillings, which is perfectly fine and you are",
          "We recently visited this place on our Kenya Safari and we would recommend it as the work these guys are doing at David Sheldrick is commendable. Also a great place to take the kids as they will love interacting with the animals."

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region. Successful artists based in Nairobi include Jua Cali, Nonini, Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and Nameless. Popular Record labels include Ogopa DJs, Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, Calif Records and Bornblack Music Group.\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi. Bob Marley's first-ever visit to Africa started in Nairobi. Acts that have performed in Nairobi include Lost Boyz, Wyclef Jean, Shaggy, Akon, Eve, T.O.K, Sean Paul, Wayne Wonder, Alaine, Konshens, Ja Rule, and Morgan Heritage, and Cabo Snoop. Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.\nNairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in Kenya producing DJs as well as producers like Jack Rooster, Euggy, DJ Fita, Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM. Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including Diplo, Major Lazer, Kyau & Albert, Solarity, Ronski Speed, and Boom Jinx.\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations. These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5 As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.Gospel music is also very popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artistes having a great impact in the mostly Christian city. Artistes such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, have a great pull over the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat have great influence over the younger generation. Their concerts are also very popular and they have as much influence as the great secular artistes. The most popular are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.\nMusical group Sauti Sol performed for U.S. President Barack Obama when he was in the city for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the Moi International Sports Centre in the suburb of Kasarani. The complex was completed in 1987, and was used to host the 1987 All Africa Games. The complex comprises a 60,000 seater stadium, the second largest in the African Great Lakes (after Tanzania's new national stadium), a 5,000 seater gymnasium, and a 2,000 seater aquatics centre.The Nyayo National Stadium is Nairobi's second largest stadium renowned for hosting global rugby event under the \"Safaricom Sevens.\" Completed in 1983, the stadium has a capacity of 30,000. This stadium is primarily used for football. The facility is located close to the Central Business District, which makes it a convenient location for political gatherings.\nNairobi City Stadium is the city's first stadium, and used for club football. Nairobi Gymkhana is the home of the Kenyan cricket team, and was a venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Notable annual events staged in Nairobi include Safari Rally (although it lost its World Rally Championship status in 2003), Safari Sevens rugby union tournament, and Nairobi Marathon.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the city by viewership and participation. This is highlighted by the number of football clubs in the city, including Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards, Tusker and Mathare United.\nThere are six golf courses within a 20 km radius of Nairobi. The oldest 18-hole golf course in the city is the Royal Nairobi Golf Club. It was established in 1906 by the British, just seven years after the city was founded. Other notable golf clubs include the Windsor Country Club, Karen Country Club, and Muthaiga Golf Club. The Kenya Open golf tournament, which is part of the European Tour, takes place in Nairobi. The Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi is the centre of horse racing in Kenya.Rugby is also a popular sport in Nairobi with 8 of the 12 top flight clubs based here.\nBasketball is also a popular sport played in the city's srimary, Secondary and college leagues. Many of the city's urban youth are basketball fans and watch the American NBA.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi (Catholic Church), Anglican Church of Kenya (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of East Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Baptist Convention of Kenya (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques including Jamia Mosque.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe majority of schools follow either the Kenyan Curriculum or the British Curriculum. There is also International School of Kenya and Rosslyn Academy, both of which follow the North American Curriculum, Swedish school in N'gong, and the German school in Gigiri.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nNairobi is home to several Universities and Colleges.\n\nThe University of Nairobi is the largest and oldest university in Kenya. It was established in 1956, as part of the University of East Africa, but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.South Eastern Kenya University is a constituent college of the University of Nairobi.\nKenyatta University is situated 16 km (9.9 mi) from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\nStrathmore University started in 1961 as an Advanced Level (UK) Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\nUnited States International University \u2013 Nairobi was originally a branch of the United States International University, but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\nIn 2005, The Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nThe Catholic University of Eastern Africa located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\nThe Technical University of Kenya (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only Technical University in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by Mwai Kibaki in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies.\nKCA University (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\nThe Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\nPan African Christian University is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\nEast Africa Institute of Certified Studies (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\nCompugoal College\nRiara University on Mbagathi road.\nUmma University is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.Numerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899.

        "wiki": "Karura Forest is an urban forest in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The forest was gazetted in 1932 and is managed by the Kenya Forest Service in conjunction with the Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association [1].\nKarura Forest is 1,041 ha (2,570 acre) consisting of three parts separated by Limuru and Kiambu roads. The large middle portion is ca. 710 ha (1,750 acres); the Sigria salient to the west is ca. 250 ha (620 acres). The portion to the east of Kiambu road has been allocated to special national priorities. As of mid-2016, 36% of the forest contains indigenous upland forest tree species. The forest is home to some 200 species of bird as well as suni, Harveys Duiker, bushbucks, bush pigs, genets, civets, honey badgers, bush babies, porcupines, Syke's monkeys, bush squirrels, hares, fruit bats, and various reptiles and butterflies. Karura now has over 50 km of trails for visitors to walk, run or bike.Due to its proximity to a growing city, there have been plans to reduce the forest in favour of housing and other development. However, these plans have been controversial with conservationists. In the late 1990s there were housing projects that would have excised portions of the forest. Conservationists, led by Wangari Maathai, the leader of Green Belt Movement who later became a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, carried out a much publicised campaign for saving the forest. Karura Forest became also a symbol of controversial land grabbings in Kenya.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKarura Forest has an area of 1 063.0 ha, making it largest of three main gazetted forest in Nairobi. The others are Ngong Forest and Oloolua Forest. The centrally located Nairobi Arboretum is much smaller.Karura Forest is located north of central Nairobi and is bordered by the suburbs of Muthaiga, Gigiri, Runda, Ridgeways, Mathare North, Peponi and New Muthaiga. The western part of the forest is also known as Sigiria Forest.The area north of central Nairobi forms a drainage basin and was once heavily forested, but exists today only as patches like Karura Forest and City Park. The forest is cut by Thigirie, Getathuru, Rui Ruaka and Karura Rivers, all tributaries of Nairobi River.Features in the forest include a waterfall, bamboo forest, marshland, Mau Mau caves and an old church.The United Nations Office at Nairobi and UNEP headquarters are located adjacent to the forest. The Karura Forest Product Research Centre is also located there.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nWildlife in the forest include Monkey species (including recently re-introduced Colobus Monkeys), bush baby, bushbuck, bush pig, porcupine, duiker, genet, dik dik, African civet and East African epauletted fruit bat.Plant species typical to the forest include Olea europaea (var. africana), Croton megalocarpus, Warburgia ugandensis, Brachyleana huillensis and the Uvaridendron anisatum.\n\n\n== Development projects and environmental issues ==\nParts of the forest were degazetted by Minister of Environment Jeremiah Nyagah in 1989. Between 1994 and 1998 a total of 564.14 hectares of the forest were secretly allocated to 64 different companies for housing projects. Around 1995 there were plans to build a housing estate in the forest, but opposition by local residents led to temporary shelving of the plans.The projects revitalised again in September 1998, when the Forest Department was issued a quit notice by private developers. The clearing of the forest started igniting fierce protests by environmentalists and others concerned. On 7 October 1998 the construction site was invaded by demonstrators, including 12 opposition MP's. The protest turned violent and bulldozers and other machinery used to clear the forest was destroyed worth more than 80 million Ksh ($2 US million).Minister for Lands and Settlements Noah Katana Ngala released a list of companies who had been allocated land in Karura Forest in November 1998. However, the records of those companies were not found at Registrar General's office, making it difficult to trace the individuals behind these companies.On 8 January 1999 when a group of women led by Wangari Maathai were holding a demonstration by planting trees near the forest, a large group of security guards attacked them. Several of them were injured, including Maathai who was taken to Nairobi Hospital. The police were reluctant to investigate the incident. However, the Attorney-General Amos Wako apologised to Maathai and promised an inquiry on the incident.The Time Magazine, in support of Maathai, named her a Hero of the Week in 1998. Klaus T\u00f6pfer, the executive director of UNEP, warned that the organisation may move its headquarters out of Kenya if the forest faces destruction. The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also condemned the attack on Maathai. Architectural Association of Kenya asked in November 1998 Kenyan architects not to be involved with any design that would threaten the forestKenyan President Daniel arap Moi criticised the protesters and asked the Church not to involve itself with the saga. Minister for Natural Resources Francis Lotodo defended the projects in January 1999 stating that Nairobi as a growing city needed space for development. Professor R. A. Obudho of University of Nairobi, who specialises in urbanisation, also supported the projectsUniversity of Nairobi students held several demonstrations for preservation the forest. On 20 January 1999 several students were injured when they clashed with police. The University if Nairobi was closed temporarily following the protests, and all students were ordered to leave the campus. Opposition MP's James Orengo (Ford-Kenya), David Mwenje (DP) and Njehu Gatabaki (SDP) were charged in court for attending student protests.Eventually housing plans were taken down in lack of public support, but land allocations still stood in place.In 2003 the NARC government led by Mwai Kibaki replaced the long-standing Moi-led KANU-government. In 2003 the Minister of Environment Newton Kulundu denied the American investor Raymond Chisholm a permit to construct a hotel in the forest. Learning that the new government would revoke dubious KANU-era land allocations, developers started to relinquish their properties in the forestThe new Kenya Forests Act in 2005  made it more difficult to degazette forests in Kenya, thus protecting Karura Forest as wellThere was a project by Kenya Forest Service, UNEP and Red Cross Kenya in 2008 to cut down eucalyptus and blue gum trees in parts of the forest and plant indigenous species in their place. Green Belt Movement was doubtful with the project, fearing that logging of the forest could actually lead to private developers invading the forestIn 2009 it was reported that part of the forest had been allocated to the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). This plan was also opposed by Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement, who stated that the NEMA should be protecting, not destructing the forest.The Nairobi Northern Bypass road, constructed in 2009, passes through a wetland that contributes to one of the five Karura Forest water courses, thus posing a threat to the forest.Karura Forest had a reputation as dangerous spot. Muggings, robbery and violence were common. At one point, said Kenya Forest Service (KFS) Head of the Nairobi Conservancy, Charity Munyasia,  they were discovering one dead body there per fortnight, on average. The Chief Forester was actually mugged in his own forest.The new Kenya Forests Act (2005) also provided for the establishment of Community Forest Associations (CFA). In 2009 an initiative was thus formed under the name 'Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association'. Recognising the growing threats to Karura from uncontrolled development the neighbouring Muthaiga and Gigiri Residents Associations begin discussions in early 2009 to form a Community Forest Association for Karura. A letter of intent circulated to northern Nairobi neighbourhoods residents, heads of agencies and VIPs under joint signature of KFS and the Muthaiga Residents\u2019 Association (MRA). A stakeholders\u2019 Working Committee was formed to steer the process, and, in order to raise awareness, it organised a media event in the form of the opening of Karura's \u2018Family Trail\u2019 on 16 May 2009 with the Hon. Noah Wekesa, Minister for Forestry and Wildlife, presiding. Hundreds of stakeholders participated in walking the length of the trail. On 25 May 2009 KFS wrote a letter to the Registrar of Societies expressing No Objection to the registration of the new CFA. Between April and July 2009 FKF-CFA office-bearers completed the required vetting processes with the Criminal Investigation Division and Registrar of Societies. The FKF-KFS joint management plans were drafted by the Working Committee. On 1 October 2009 the Registrar of Societies signed the Certificate of Registration for the Friends of Karura Community Forest Association. At the First FKF Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2010 Alice Macaire became FKF's first elected chairperson.\nThe nascent and unique parastatal-stakeholder partnership took its first major management decision on 25 Feb 2010 when FKS and FKF signed an MOU concerning installation and operation of an electric fence to fully secure the forest perimeter. FKF raised the necessary funds and the fence was completed in September. In December 2010 the Strategic Management Plan signed by KFS Director D.K, Mbugua, and on 26\u201327 February 2011 there was a Grand Opening Ceremony in the forest to celebrate a Karura that was now \u2019Secure, Safe & Serene\u2019 and open for visitors.\nAt the second FKF Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2011. Prof. Karanja Njoroge, who had served as Wangari Maathai's deputy at the GreenBelt Movement, was elected to chairmanship of FKF.  Wangari Maathai and Alice Macaire were anointed as honorary Patrons of the Community Forest Association. Cristina Boelcke-Croze continued as vice-chair along with Judge Sharad Rao.\nThus, in only five years, the FKF Community Forest Association in partnership with the Kenya Forest Service and Kenyan corporate and private donors, fenced, secured and transformed Karura \"from the dumping site for hijackers and murderers and illegal private developers\"  into a popular local recreation and conservation site.  From literally zero visitors in 2009, the forest is now welcoming an average of 16,000 visitors a month, 70% of whom are Kenyan citizens. In 2015 there were some 600,000 visitors.A documentary  about the transformation of the forest, \" Rejuvenating The Karura Forest: Danger Spots to Green Haven,\" was produced by Duncan Ndotono and directed by Brenda Okoth,  recognised efforts being made to nurture Karura Forest back to life  \nThe Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association can be contacted at rafiki@karurafriends.org. Website: http://www.friendsofkarura.org\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nKarura Forest is now developed as a visitor's attraction, with some 16,000 entries per month. This includes creation of some 50 km of nature trails for walking, running and biking. The first trail, which is four kilometres long and connects Limuru Road with Old Kiambu Road was opened in May 2009. An electric fence has been built around the forest for security reasons. Although 70% of Karura's visitors are Kenyan citizens, there is a growing appreciation by an international clientele as witnessed by Karura having received a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence for two years running (2014\u201315) and being listed as No. 4 out of 101 Things To Do in Nairobi.The Karura Forest Environmental Education Trust (KFEET) was formed in 2010, and launched by then Minister for Forestry and Wildlife Noah Wekesa. KFEET manages an environmental education centre located in Karura Forest and facilitating access to thousands of Kenyan school children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKenya Forest Service\nFriends of Karura Forest\nKenya Ministry of Wildlife",

          "It's not really big enough for a hike, but more for a leisurely walk in lush peaceful greenery. The circuit is 5-6 kms long and you can do it either way. You pass by a small waterfall, a tiny oasis of bamboo forest trees, a cave and a few other small features and loads of bird",

          "It's close to the Karen Blixen Museum. If you like paths in woodland, this is worth trying but wear footwear with a good grip as some paths are at times steep and slippery. We enjoyed the view in the wooded valley, the waterfall and the atmosphere among the trees (when we were",

          "I was here again today, one of dozens and dozens of visits I've made to this lovely small forest in the past 17 years. You must explore here on your own, finding the waterfall, cave, large bamboo plants, and fascinating papyrus area alongside the river. If you happen to do",

          "We enjoyed the walk at Oloolua. The scenery was beautiful, and the place was not crowded. A nice place to spend a Sunday afternoon, when all you need is just a peace of mind.",
          "I love Oloolua mainly because it's hardly ever crowded and the sound of the Mbagathi River running through it has an awesome calming effect on me. It's rather short compared to any of the trails in karura but the dense forest, the quietude, the singing of the birds and the fact",
          "I had some free time in Nairobi, so I took a cab, to Oloolua Forest. It's a beautiful fragment of indigenous forest that is tucked away in one of the more well-to-do neighborhoods on the outskirts of Nairobi. The land is apparently owned by the Institute of Primate Research,",
          "We are pretty adventurous folks and don't mind taking 'the scenic' route and getting slightly lost. It is frustrating, however, to spend over 2 hours there and completely missing the cave! A few signs, arrows painted on trees or something simple that doesn't cost much would make",
          "I think my title sums it all. I keep going there because of how quiet it is and the waterfall, for meditation purposes, but there's very little to see.",
          "It is an ideal place to just relax away from all the hustle and stress of the city life. The water fall especially is breathtaking and the air is fresh because of the many trees around. It is also a good place to have picnics.",
          "Went to the nature trail today. Entry fees are cheap and friendly. The nature trail is not as well maintained as Karura nature trail. There is no security visible are you navigate the nature trail. One side of of the nature trail opens to the main high way with no fence around",
          "In all honesty I expected much more. its not really a place you can go solo like other nature trails. In a group it can be better, and its not something where you can spend and enjoy an entire day. All in all, average. And just worth a one time visit.",
          "Oloolua is tucked away in Karen Hardy area and offers a lovely green escape to walk, jog or have a picnic. The trail of about 5km has diverse, indigenous flora with part of Mbagathi River passing through it, complete with a waterfall! There are also caves to explore and for",
          "I have visited this place 3 years straight.... Very quiet place.. Birdwatchers paradise. A small waterfall exists and you can take photos, chill out with family and friends... BBQ's are allowed, as long as they are controlled i.e. grills, charcoal ovens. Though it's advised",
          "I went early on a Sunday morning when it was quiet - no yet filled with picnic goers (there are picnic sites and camping grounds). I saw a couple of people with their dogs, and two individuals. The trail is part stone, part track, and a bridge or four or more. There's a bamboo",
          "The place is great to visit..the nature trail is about 5 kilometres long... Alongthe trail there is a cave, a beautiful water fall and a picnic bench.. Great for Saturday morning runs... Entry fee is 200 Kenyan shillings for residents",
          "I love a forest walk but this is just a bit disappointing. Unlike Karura forest which is well managed with great paths and loads of animals and bird life this feels a bit unloved. There were crowds of noisy picnickers, litter, overgrown narrow paths etc. You never feel you're",
          "Having popped down to the trail in early April for the first time; a friend and I did the dash down to the cave and back. Whilst we managed in sandals, I would recommend better shoes (and a tetanus shot!). Partly as the terrain is mixed, but mainly as the paths, stairs and rails",
          "The forest is located in the serene and quite neighborhood of Karen in Nairobi. You can choose to have a picnic, walk through the nature trail or camp. They charge differently for each item but they are all affordable. Its much affordable if you want to camp in groups of 10, you",

          "Looking for a cheap way to kill a Saturday/Sunday afternoon? Go be at one with nature at Oloolua Nature Trail! The artificial waterfall adds to the scenic beauty. They have a cave too, pitch dark and scary in a beautiful way. Go go!",

          "Visited with the family. So many beautiful mature trees and a troop of monkeys (about forty of them!) passed through the forest while we were there! With that being said, it was a little strange to see all the pipes and pumps around the waterfall... I wish there was a way they",
          "If you are looking for a remote place to just go and be alone or spend some time alone out with just nature around you, this is the place. While it also serves as a very good picnic spot for groups, I found it to serve individuals better. Its a matter of preference though. Its a",
          "Oloolua Nature Trail is part of the 662 Ha Oloolua Forest. It is a little-known paradise of rich vegetation and with so much to offer the traveller wanting a place away from the hustle and bustle of Nairobi city yet near enough to afford a spontaneous decision to visit.",
          "This place is great, and good for picnics but only problem is no washrooms. So go for a few hours and rush back home, there is a waterfalls and caves as well. Magnificent place nature at its best",
          "There are not many safe places to walk in Nairobi. This is one of them. It offers space for a pleasant short walk close to the city, and is a nice adjunct to a boozy lunch at one of the nearby Karen restaurants",
          "Went once and keep going back for more, calm and collected trail. Good for walking and just enjoying the environment. Inexpensive and can even host a picnic.",
          "This place is very green with fairly clear paths. On the downside it is not very big and the highlights are not that exciting. The waterfall is not super large and has pumps and pipes on the sides. The cave is not that big and doesn't extend very far. The swamp is nothing",
          "As far as I am concerned, it is a nice natural forest. Though i did not see wild animals or birds probably i didn't go their side but my visit after Christmas with a bunch of kids and games was best experience. Especially when there isn't much to do in a busy sunny Nairobi. I",
          "a good plan for a saturday afternoon with friends who love nature. The scenery is epic with some good views near the waterfalls. My best part of the walk was going into some really dark caves with tonnes of bats. A bit creepy but loads of fun.",
          "Has a nice nature walk which one can do with the family and a 4 year old can also complete it. Do go with enough water/drinks and snacks. Alternatively one can also carry a picnic lunch and have it at the shades Dress lightly as the weather can be warm during the walk.",
          "This was a great way to get out of the sun but stay in nature. The park has clearly marked trails and some beautiful sites. We found a decent waterfall, caves and lots of wildlife. The paths can be a bit step and rugged, so wear good shoes. They tell you that newbies to the",
          "It's a nice place to have a walk in the forest and enjoy mother nature. There are places in the forest where people can have a picnic and enjoy. There also a lot of benches in the forest where people can sit.",
          "This is a nice short walk in Karen. We like to do it on Sundays before having lunch at Tamambo or Purdy Arms. The trail is nicely built with waterfall, cave, papyrus area, bamboo place with seating. Best time is Sunday morning, as most people are in church and it is peaceful.",
          "We walked the children and dogs here this morning, through forest terrain and criss-crossing a small river. The trail is lovely, although marred by litter in places. A few extra directional signs would improve the overall experience",
          "Smaller and less popular than Karua and less groomed but another alternative escape. Marked walks, waterfalls and caves. Limited facilities so plan to be self sufficient.",
          "The Oloolua Nature Trail is a nice place to burn calories after a scrumptious meal at the nearby Tamambo. The gate staff were really friendly and gave us a quick overview of the sights and walking times. Since our time was short, my son and I headed straight for the",
          "It is located in an unlikely place, a beautiful forest in the heart of Karen. If you enjoying taking a walk in the woods and/or enjoy a run in the woods then this is a good place. The disappointing thing about the nature trail is that it is not well marked, some of there signs",

          "Going to Bomas of Kenya was definitely a memorable experience. We didn\u2019t get to observe the tribal homes nearly as much as we expected, due to the insane numbers of baboons we saw. There were 4 people in sight, with maybe 40 baboons preventing any of us from passing the first",

          "I went there for a school trip with my friends. It was really nice, but it was rain season therefore very muddy. I recommend jogging shoes if you are going during rainy season. At the end of the tour there was a place where you could buy souvenirs at an amazing price.",
          "You get to see the different dances and style of clothes of almost all the kenyan tribes as well as the hutsbthat they used to live at in the past. Very interesting around 2 hours.",
          "A great visit. There were lots of school parties watching the dancing which added to the excitement and interaction between dancers and audience. I learnt a lot about the different types of tribal dance and enjoyed it enormously. The Huts are very interesting as well. Really",
          "If you are looking for a way to learn a bit of Kenyan culture, traditions, and beliefs, then Bomas of Kenya is the place to be. They have cultural dances and tours to Kenyan traditional villages daily. You can also enjoy a local cuisine at the Utamanduni restaurant or learn to",
          "The concept around bomas of kenya is great but the dancers needs more enthusiasm and the bomas well maintained.",
          "This is worth seeing especially if you've been travelling around the country as there are houses from many areas and it's interesting to see the differences and similarities, more of the latter it has to be said. There is a tribal dance show at 3.30 which we sadly missed but",
          "I was really excited to visit the Bomas centre and experience some cultural Kenya. The different village set ups in the grounds are really great and I love that you can go in and out and experience the different styles. The info charts are helpful, but the place just lacked a",

          "The area is easy to enter by car and there was immediately someone to guide you in right direction for entrance. We explored all the bomas and you can easily walk around for all of them. Weather was nice. We also joined the Kenyan dance show and visited the restaurant as well.",
          "Really was an average experience to be frank and kind of out of the way as well. Having visited Nairobi National Museum and Elephant Orphanage I would recommend these sites to someone out enjoying a day in Nairobi.",
          "At Bomas you get to experience several different traditional dance performances. There may have been 8-10 different performances. With each dance there was some background information provided which was helpful. Afterwards you can tour traditional living accommodations of the",

          "Great cultural experience, though it might have been nice to have a guide. Leave plenty of time to work around all of the villages and see the show!",

          "Nice place to learn a few things about the various communities in Kenya although it didn't look authentic to me (had a visit of some villages in the maasai mara and were more authentic). The dances were rather interesting and quite entertaining. Not so bad though, worth a visit",
          "We enjoyed seeing the various homes that people constructed and inhabited...and some still do. The simple life can be so much better in a myriad of ways.",
          "Clean place, nice and attractive show including dances and songs. perfect place in order to be familiar with the life of different tribes good gift center very economy entrance fee",

          "Friends the first time I went to Bomas was 36 years ago. This was when the dancers were the real tribes and not rehearsed professional dancers, there was a an authenticity. For many reasons this has become far from heritage or traditional dance. I was surprised seeing the",
          "The differences in details of the huts of tribes are not obvious, so you better get a guide. The dance and acrobat performances in the afternoon are wonderful and funny. If you like to eat there and especially if you want to eat indigenous food, you order some days ahead.",
          "I went to Bomas of Kenya alone, thinking it'd be safe... I was invited to dance during the show so I went. And at the end, one of the dancers was very drunk and harassed me, asking me for money, and my number. He wouldn't want to let go off my hand... Pretty scary and",
          "What a gem! Bomas is where culture lives. Come and spend an afternoon that you will never forget. Whats more, they have a pretty cool bar and restaurant in house. Four stars I would say.",

          "We came here the day after we had been traveling for 30 hrs. The entry fee for non-resident adults was 1000 KS each. The Bomas consists of two parts: the grounds where there are 23 types of traditional forms of housing/huts displayed, and the dance presentation in the",
          "This was a visit as part of a tour. It was interesting but not something I would prioritise. The dances are performed within a dance hall, are quite rehearsed. The Boma's are interesting and many tribes are represented but it is quite repetitive with many villages structured the",
          "We went to the Bomas for some meetings. Basically it is set up with African huts and other African cultural items to attract tourists. There are a number of more interesting places to visit in Nairobi!",

          "My 2 teenagers and I enjoyed our visit here. It gives you a great overview of the habitats of the African Tribes. One needs to walk around the place. At our interest level, reading the boards and information, it took us about 35/40 minutes. In fact, all thru' our trip within",
          "Interesting to see the different types of houses/villages. We also saw the dancing performances from several of the regions.",
          "This is a well curated assortment of the various styles of primative/country villages. They differ only modestly, but are nicely arranged. The reason to go is to see the dance and music show, which highlights various styles, and is VERY well done. To save a lot of money, don't",
          "Great introduction to Kenya! 1.5 hour dance show with different tribal dances. Loved the passion of the dancers! The grounds were filled with the houses of the Kenyan tribes -- so interesting to see the differences and similarities. Was very glad we chose to do this during",

          "A Kenyan had recommended this place to me. I had gone there with friends mainly to see the cultural show consisting of dances from various parts of Kenya. The music is as entertaining as the dancing. If you don't relish audience participation in performances, then sit somewhere",
          "If you want a deeper sense of culture in Kenya, this is the place to get it. Bomas shows you examples of how each tribe lived in Kenya, and you can compare the styles of their villages, homes and domestic lives. One important thing to know is that each tribe presents a dance in",

          "I was here a long time ago and I was great to see the changes/ improvements that had been made. It's always great to be reminded of one' culture. The traditional dances did it for me. The dancers were very enthusiastic and automatically drew me in. Keep up the good job.",
          "We visited Bomas the last day of our Kenyan trip. Since our trip had consisted primarily of game drives, we enjoyed learning about the culture of many of the Kenyan tribes. The guide who took us around the area with the huts from different tribes was very informative and",
          "The huts are great and are a lovely peek into times gone by. They could use more interpretation about dressings of the huts and the general cultures. This may be addressed in the tour after the show but as we needed to leave immediately after the show we had to do a self guided",
          "Bomas are homesteads.....there are examples of many of these of Kenya's tribes. This site is a good place to introduce a visitor to Kenyan culture. After walking amongst the various huts and homes, an indoor performance of music and dancing is available. There were not many",
          "Learning about the various tribes and then seeing the performances afterwards was a very memorable experience. Watch out for the monkeys inside the theater and the baboons outside.",
          "the price is very cheap but they turn charge alot to take you there the best option is to pay a tour and combine it for a whole day tour so you will not pay a huge price dont pay only a tour to go here, either go by your own means or go in a full day tour to see",

          "Bomas of Kenya is in Karen, south Nairobi. We went there to see the dancers. The experience consists of 2 elements - the dance performance and a walk in the little park where they have built various examples of african huts. I would say that the huts are more interesting then",

          "Bomas of Kenya (conventional farm houses) is a tourist village, about 10 km south of Nairobi city center, towards Nairobi National Park. It was conceived and planned by Barrack Obama Sr. (father of American 44th President, Barrack Obama) in 1971 in his capacity as Head of KTDC",
          "I had the challenge of choosing a dinner venue for my colleagues who were visiting. The cultural experience at the cottages and the African cuisine at the Utamaduni Restaurant was the icing on the cake. I loved it. Would definitely come again!",
          "We went on a weekday during low season and the place was abandoned. The ticket seller told us there would be people at the huts to explain and show us about how each tribe lives/lived in their traditional houses. This did not happen. My daughter and I had the place to",

          "We got there a bit too early, thinking there was a lot to do. At 1200 hours the place was deserted. Our Grandaughter played in the adventure playground (Just a park really). It was gated and entrance fee of 50KES. I didn't mind that and staff were so nice fetching me a chair.",
          "Let's just say: I learnt a lot about my culture than my grandmother had taught me. I was impressed with how the first wife in all the community was respected. Good time to visit - morning or late evenings. It can get very hot at midday making it hard to move from one community",
          "there is nothing to write about that worth the time and effort getting to the place,there is no tour guide",
          "I visited Bomes of Kenya on quite a rainy day. The visit to the sample houses is really interesting and fun. The dances were not quite what I expected, as the dance hall was quite empty and the dancers were all the same people (about 10) only changing some attires before dancing",

          "For the price you pay to get in, it's worth it. However, the villages all looked the same after awhile and the dance show was very very long. There was one point where it seemed like the story of one dance just dragged on and on. We didn't stay until the end because it wasn't",
          "Nice way to wind down the day after an early morning visit to Nairobi National Park and a nice lunch. We watched a cultural performance and visited the bomas and had a nature walk.",
          "Well worth the visit to see the various styles of huts the different tribes used and to see the layout. The husband's hut was not always as big as that of any of his wives. Not only was the style interesting but the use of different materials. The selection of dances performed",
          "I visited again in September on a price holiday, this time taking a Kenyan friend and UK sister and teenage niece. This is always an enjoyable visit but you can't help thinking it could be more. The various huts / homesteads are well laid out with a description of each set",

          "This was easily one of the highlights of my short trip to Nairobi, as I am a dancer. Each dance told a different story and they interact with the audience. If you don't want to be picked to go on stage sit up the back. You are allowed to take your own pictures and video's and",

          "An evening finale to a conference, Bomas was an excellent choice. We had a sumptuous spread of local cuisine and the array of traditional dances was awesome. I do hope the dancers get enough patronage to keep them in business! Bomas is a must see for Nairobi visitors.",

          "Interesting to see how different tribes live. A lot of it is dated though as only the very rural tribes live like this now. I've lived in Kenya for 6 years and you don't see these sorts of huts and bomas much. If you are a visitor to Kenya who does not have much time then yes",
          "The afternoon show was fantastic especially the comedy. Dancers and acrobats from various regions of Kenya. You can buy some light food during the interval. Outside the main auditorium, there are various type of huts to show how villages operates in various tribes, you will",

          "The villages were a little hokey and repetitious. And being 6' 4\", I had difficulty getting inside many of the huts, but I did find them interesting and they left some huts unfinished to give you the idea of how they made them. The biggest surprise was the dancers, musicians",
          "I have to say Bomas of Kenya is one of those places that captures our african heritage in a time capsule. Growing up in the city with a Maasai family, I always longed to go back in time and identify with life back in the day. Bomas of Kenya captures the tiny details of what life",

          "On the grounds you can see traditional homesteads from 27 different tribes. Interesting to see. After a while they begin to look somewhat alike, perhaps, but then you can amuse yourself with the subtle differences. Arrive for the dance performance, where you'll see a variety",

          "The Bomas features examples of the villages of the various tribes of Kenya. No need to visit all of them as many very similar and you might get bored if you do. Do not recommend doing this during the heat of the day. Do see the cultural dance show and be a willing",
          "We could get to see culture of the various African tribes by witnessing the cultural show of the Bomas of Kenya. Apart from the fabulous tribal dances and acrobatics performed by the dancers and acrobats; we could get to see how the tribals live in their villages. A must see for",

          "We visited here one week day. We were shown to a large arena which was nearly empty and a troup of dancers came out and danced various tribal dances and sang. They changed costume accordingly. We weren't terribly enamoured but perhaps it was because the vast arena was empty",
          "A visit to the Bomas of Kenya was on the programme of a conference I attended in November in Nairobi and what was well intended by the organizers, to showcase a bit of Kenya's cultural diversity, got all fouled up by traffic. This left little time to explore, a shame really for",

          "We had lunch at the restaurant, the food was local and good, then we looked at the tribal homestead exhibition which was very interesting, and finally we watched the tribal dance show. It was nice that there was a cafe to buy chips and drinks for the show, you can also buy a",

          "A great experience showing huge amount of insight into the kenyan experience from amazing dancers and traditional housing from numerous tribes. Well worth a visit.",
          "The vernacular architecture is interesting and varied. Also the dancers in the amphitheater are pretty cool!",
          "An authentic show of original African dances. The costumes were beautiful, and the dancers gave they all in each dance they performed. It was an amazing performed for the price of admission that lasted a couple of hours! That would have cost $100 to see in America an",

          "My visit to Bomas of Kenya is memorable. The highlight of it is the traditional traditional dance from Kenya and the rest of East Africa which is very rewarding. A visit to the cultural village exposes you to how more than 4 Kenyan tribes build their homesteads. A very lovely",
          "The highlight for me was the culture show. I enjoyed walking and seeing the \"villages\" but after about three, they start to look alike. There is a group of souvenir stalls lining the path to the first village which has some interesting thing. Sellers are not aggressive, which",
          "I only managed to get the chance to see the performance section of the park, but that alone was worth the visit. A series of dance and musical performances offer insight into Kenya's many tribes, and the closing acrobatic act was a treat too.",

          "Going to the Bomas of Kenya is very interesting. You should probably plan for at least a 4 hours visit, we did not have that much time. I have to admit I was more ignorant than I thought about Kenya tribes and culture, the Bomas gave me a much broder point of view. If you have",
          "Now, I'm writing this review for the type of people that are going on dates. I took my girlfriend here once and it was pretty amazing. It's not crazy all-up-in-your-face fun, but rather more tranquil and chill. It provides a place where you can actually really talk to someone",
          "this is showcase of Kenyas culture in a miniature, and it gives you the feel and the picture of the cultures of Kenya numbering to more that 42 tribes in one location, but i would still recommend you make a date to visit the real cultures on the ground for real and upto date",

          "The buildings are interesting and show you a variety of ways people have lived in Kenya, and maybe still do. Go early so you can at least walk through the villages. The real high point is the music, dancing, and acrobatics show. When we went it was totally crazy though with",
          "I liked this outdoor museum a lot. However It gets somewhat trivial to hear about dances, rituals and building styles that to a foreigner seem quite alike. This is why I prefer to walk around without a guide. Many fascinating dances. Some of the dancers seemed a bit tired all",
          "My Mexican friend loves African Music and Dance so I took her to the Bomas of Kenya for both. The music echo across the green wooded area as we approach the 3000 seat round, thatch roofed amphitheater. As we were led to our seats we passed hundreds of Kenyan school children ages",

          "You can see most of the tribal performances authentic to Kenya at Bomas of Kenya. You get enough entertainment for the price you pay. Daily performances are at 2.30pm. So if you get there around 11 O'clock in the morning you can see around and get back to the auditorium in time",
          "A perfect place to get a glimpse of the culture of the different tribes of Kenya with great shows performed, Visit the tribal village setting, exact reflection of Kenya History.",

          "The warthogs zeroed on me, but trotted off peacefully. The kids were thrilled, but I, having been there severally, kept on looking at what could be. The bikers worn by the dancers? Watches? Modern trappings are evident, a sign of hurriedly preparedness to work and get over the",
          "I went on a Saturday and... nothing. It is a park of different thatched buildings, but once you have seen one - you have seen them all. Even my local guide was really bored. They do some African dancing in an auditorium - but neither me or the guide could be bothered to wait",
          "Very amateuristic organised but it started on time. Basically visited by many schoolkids of all ages who during the program came and went. As a non kenyan, most performances looked very much alike",

          "The first thing to say was that we visited on a weekday, in May, so not the busiest time. The good bit, no the great bit was the dancing. 80 minutes with a short break flew by. Great dancing, music and information. The entrance price was cheap enough and the various guide",
          "My son (6) being for the first time in Kenya enjoyed the dances and the acrobatics. Beautiful place to visit.",
          "Nice dance show that covers many different dances and made by professionals BUT not too professional so it felt nice. The exhibition of different village styles and information signs were interesting. The restaurant not impressing but good price.",
          "They are some way out of time, and in my opinion only worth visiting if you need to kill some time. However, if you are looking for something to do, then they are worth visiting. You need to allow plenty of time to wander round everywhere as it is a large complex.",
          "The ambience is very positive, then the various dances presented by the then group gave me a chill that this culture is so rich and yet diversified. But was satisfied that they promote on a very professional yet friendly manner.",

          "I went here on Friday and it seemed like there were several thousand young school children here....which I will get to later. The dancing was ok, you could tell some of the dancers were pretty new and some we good. Still, it was very interesting to see some traditional dances.",
          "We were a couple there today with only one other tourist, the rest were a couple of schools. We were not offered a programme so had no idea the nature of dances or where they were from, the announcements were impossible to hear. Poor dances and even worse musicians. Outside the",

          "Nice representations of the culture and building styles of the various Kenyan communities. Most of the huts are already looking worn. Great educational visit for the kids though with ample parking space and a little collectors shopping area",
          "The variety of dances exhibited is fascinating, the acrobats well worth the entry price, and the traditional villages of each tribe in Kenya out the back, very interesting. I found the taboos on building the huts particularly interesting - some tribes had an all male building",
          "Guess I have myself to blame as I'm the one who insisted to our operator that we should include this in our Nairobi city tour , post our Mara safari. Far from being a showcase of the local Kenyan culture and its diversity, one gets the feeling its a ''put on'' more than",

          "Bomas of Kenya was a big let down. We had gone with lot of expectations to learn about Kenyan culture but all it had were few dances & 1 or 2 musical pieces. Then there were samples of the huts in which the kenyans were leaving. but all that was pretty average. One can",

          "Our 4 year old loved the traditional dancing (especially the acrobatic dancers) and sat enthralled through the whole show. Then both our 4 and 2 year olds loved exploring the mud and straw huts of the many different models of traditional villages. They were a bit disappointed",

          "We really liked this place as it gives a nice idea how different tribes build their houses in Kenya. We also enjoyed the show that last for more than two hours. The fee is not big and gives value for the money!",
          "I would recommend Bomas if you need some down time. There were traditional villages to visit and take pictures of. They all started looking the same after awhile. We then went inside to watch the dancing. You were able to buy cold drinks for the show. The show was interesting,",

          "Really loved visiting Bomas of Kenya. The dances were very entertaining (even though the music was horrendously loud). The acrobats were incredible and had the pleasure of being picked from the crowd to be a part of their act. The guide showing us the villages was knowledgable",
          "It was a wonderful experience. I enjoyed the traditional music and the stage performance of the stuntmen who were in action.",
          "I really loved all of the dances and the schoolchildren's responses to them. I wish that the announcer had a sound system, as we couldn't hear her. I guess we were not in the main location. Perhaps the sound is better in the main hall. The buildings are also fascinating",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Bomas. We not only saw quite a myriad of little villages but were also treated to a terrific song and dance performance in the auditorium. If you visit, please send your photos to us because our camera was stolen so we lost our pictures of",

          "I went to the Bomas of Kenya during a round about trip to the Giraffe and Elephant centers in Karen. This place is well worth the visit. Not that people were there which was surprising. However, the grounds are a great way to see a small sampling of Kenyas 42 tribes. Considering",

          "The tribal homes at the Bomas have not changed for eons and make for an interesting historical note. But the real clincher is the show at the auditorium. The traditional dancers and acrobats are quite worth the visit!",

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region. Successful artists based in Nairobi include Jua Cali, Nonini, Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and Nameless.

Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including Diplo, Major Lazer, Kyau & Albert, Solarity, Ronski Speed, and Boom Jinx.\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations. These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5 As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.Gospel music is also very popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artistes having a great impact in the mostly Christian city. Artistes such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, have a great pull over the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat have great influence over the younger generation. Their concerts are also very popular and they have as much influence as the great secular artistes. The most popular are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.\nMusical group Sauti Sol performed for U.S. President Barack Obama when he was in the city for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the Moi International Sports Centre in the suburb of Kasarani.

Notable annual events staged in Nairobi include Safari Rally (although it lost its World Rally Championship status in 2003), Safari Sevens rugby union tournament, and Nairobi Marathon.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the city by viewership and participation. This is highlighted by the number of football clubs in the city, including Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards, Tusker and Mathare United.\nThere are six golf courses within a 20 km radius of Nairobi. The oldest 18-hole golf course in the city is the Royal Nairobi Golf Club.

The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899. A population projection in the 21st century is listed below.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nNairobi is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

The word \"uhuru\" is Swahili for \"freedom\". It contains three points of significance:\n\nThe M\u0169gumo tree (Ficus sycomorus), purportedly planted in the exact location the Union Jack, or more likely the former Flag of the Colony of Kenya, was removed and the Flag of Kenya was placed. The tree is also of significance to the Kikuyu people.\nThe independence commemorative monument, built in 1973, is a twenty-four meter high column, supporting a pair of clasped hands and a dove of peace. This point celebrates the declaration of independence at midnight, 12 December 1963. It also celebrates the inauguration of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, in the same night. On one side of this monument is a statue of soldiers raising the Kenyan flag.\nA fountain celebrating \"Twenty-Five years of Uhuru \u2013 peace, love and unity monument\".\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The Snake Park is a below average exhibit of snakes, etc. The glass enclosed \"tank-like\" structures are unkempt, and the animals are OK, but not an enjoyable time. It is nice to see a large boa or cobra, but not enough to recommend the park.",
          "if you like viewing \"serpents\" of all sizes, color, length...all you think about snakes, visit snake park. It is a bit scary, mostly because of the rattling and hissing, but it is safe because they are housed in glass...no worry!! Very exciting indeed.",

          "The Snake park is practically part of the Nairobi National Museun, but you have to pay extra, if you want to visit it. Unfortunatelly you can't see much of the snakes, as the windows haven't been cleaned since ages. Better avoid it...",
          "Since I was at the Nairobi Museum, I visited the Snake Park because it's right next door, and because I really wanted to see the mambas and cobras. The snake specimen at the Snake Park are wonderful, but the habitats are dismal. Only the crocodile and the python have",
          "My mother used to bring us here when we were children. It hasn't changed much over the years but the snakes and fish etc were well fed and looked to be healthy. It was getting a lick of paint while I was there and perhaps needs a bit of upgrading but all in all a good wee",
          "The Snake Park is a good place to get acquainted with the reptiles of Kenya. Of particular interest were the cobra and mamba snakes. While the exhibits are somewhat old fashioned they are informative and we enjoyed the visit. We also had an opportunity to speak with a number",
          "This experience was not worth the extra cost to visit whilst at the museum. I have seen better in Australia although the snakes and tortoises were different.",
          "This is definitely very well kept, and the staff know what they are talking about. Its a bit creepy if you don't like crawlies... but the kids love it! The National Museum shares the same space - its great too! Also if you are lucky they have once a year an orchid showing... we",
          "Easily accessible and fun for kids and adults too. They have variety (snakes, Crocs and aquarium area). Took my almost 3 yrs old niece and 6 yrs old nephew, they did not want to leave which earned me some \"Cool Auntie\" points.",
          "This reptiled shelter appears neglected from the word go. The exhibit snakes though average in numbers have good information on the placards but there seems room for upgraded conditions.",
          "There were few snakes and they looked more like inmates than animals in as close to their natural habitat as possible. Needs improvement!",
          "My kids loved this park which is attached to the Nairobi National Museum. I've never seen this many active snakes before! It must have been the cool weather because they were slithering all over their cages. Pretty impressive. They could have been in better cages because the",
          "You don't pay much for entrance, but I feel like they could have done more with the display. If you have been to a snake park already there is nothing new to see. Most of the snakes are just behind glass and no attempt is made to create a habitat for them. It actually makes you",
          "Snake park was a big disappointment. If you have been to snake parks before keep away from this one. No wow factor. Not much to learn. Parks in Europe is even better...",
          "Not onoly fun to visit but a little scary too... Love the special signs as well as the information of the various snakes you can see. I think it is perfectly safe but one shoould be careful. Our children found it a fun place to visit as well.",
          "All the animals here looked, to me, really depressed, with crap environments. Expensive. Right next to the National Museum so we had reduced entry as a double whammy.",
          "This small reptile house displays mainly crocs and snakes. If you want to see some of Africa's most deadly residents close up, you can do so in safety. If you find one of the keepers, and offer a generous tip, you can get around the back to handle some of the non venomous snakes",
          "This place has been neglected.Has the potential to attract a lot of visitors if it was refurbished and more animals/reptiles added.There are only a handful of those.The location is convenient and the grounds are serene.However,everything else is mediocre.",
          "Despite the lack of signage, the fairly run down displays and the poor animals caged, this was interesting and cool. I enjoyed looking at the variety of reptiles on display and only wished the glass was cleaner for a better view! A nice addition to the day after the national",
          "Quite sad place. There was few snakes in small and dirty boxes (glasses were so dirty, that it was hard to see through) and also crocodiles in small cages. We felt very bad for those animals.",
          "The reason I went to Snake Park is the combined ticket they sell in Nairobi National Museum. The standalone ticket is 1200KES, while the combined ticket (Museum + Snake Park) is 1500KES, therefore I thought why not give it a try? Turned out the place was not worth visiting at",
          "A large range of snakes native to Kenya and very interesting for a visitor. with good descriptions and background. Would recommend it those wanting to see beyond Kenya's other wonderful wildlife and see their snakes, and most are highly venomous.",

          "The Nairobi Snake Park was started in January, 1961 to meet a popular attraction and to provide a research facility on reptiles, breeding of snakes. Live snakes were exhibited on experimental basis at the entrance of the Museum in 1958 which later became a popular",

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region. Successful artists based in Nairobi include Jua Cali, Nonini, Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and Nameless.

Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including Diplo, Major Lazer, Kyau & Albert, Solarity, Ronski Speed, and Boom Jinx.\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations. These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5 As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.Gospel music is also very popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artistes having a great impact in the mostly Christian city. Artistes such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, have a great pull over the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat have great influence over the younger generation. Their concerts are also very popular and they have as much influence as the great secular artistes. The most popular are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.\nMusical group Sauti Sol performed for U.S. President Barack Obama when he was in the city for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the Moi International Sports Centre in the suburb of Kasarani. The complex was completed in 1987, and was used to host the 1987 All Africa Games.

Notable annual events staged in Nairobi include Safari Rally (although it lost its World Rally Championship status in 2003), Safari Sevens rugby union tournament, and Nairobi Marathon.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the city by viewership and participation. This is highlighted by the number of football clubs in the city, including Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards, Tusker and Mathare United.\nThere are six golf courses within a 20 km radius of Nairobi. The oldest 18-hole golf course in the city is the Royal Nairobi Golf Club.

There is also International School of Kenya and Rosslyn Academy, both of which follow the North American Curriculum, Swedish school in N'gong, and the German school in Gigiri.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nNairobi is home to several Universities and Colleges.\n\nThe University of Nairobi is the largest and oldest university in Kenya. It was established in 1956, as part of the University of East Africa, but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.South Eastern Kenya University is a constituent college of the University of Nairobi.\nKenyatta University is situated 16 km (9.9 mi) from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\nStrathmore University started in 1961 as an Advanced Level (UK) Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\nUnited States International University \u2013 Nairobi was originally a branch of the United States International University, but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\nIn 2005, The Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nThe Catholic University of Eastern Africa located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\nThe Technical University of Kenya (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only Technical University in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by Mwai Kibaki in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies.\nKCA University (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\nThe Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town.

The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899. A population projection in the 21st century is listed below.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nNairobi is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Karura Forest is an urban forest in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The forest was gazetted in 1932 and is managed by the Kenya Forest Service in conjunction with the Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association [1].\nKarura Forest is 1,041 ha (2,570 acre) consisting of three parts separated by Limuru and Kiambu roads. The large middle portion is ca. 710 ha (1,750 acres); the Sigria salient to the west is ca. 250 ha (620 acres). The portion to the east of Kiambu road has been allocated to special national priorities. As of mid-2016, 36% of the forest contains indigenous upland forest tree species. The forest is home to some 200 species of bird as well as suni, Harveys Duiker, bushbucks, bush pigs, genets, civets, honey badgers, bush babies, porcupines, Syke's monkeys, bush squirrels, hares, fruit bats, and various reptiles and butterflies. Karura now has over 50 km of trails for visitors to walk, run or bike.Due to its proximity to a growing city, there have been plans to reduce the forest in favour of housing and other development. However, these plans have been controversial with conservationists. In the late 1990s there were housing projects that would have excised portions of the forest. Conservationists, led by Wangari Maathai, the leader of Green Belt Movement who later became a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, carried out a much publicised campaign for saving the forest. Karura Forest became also a symbol of controversial land grabbings in Kenya.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKarura Forest has an area of 1 063.0 ha, making it largest of three main gazetted forest in Nairobi. The others are Ngong Forest and Oloolua Forest. The centrally located Nairobi Arboretum is much smaller.Karura Forest is located north of central Nairobi and is bordered by the suburbs of Muthaiga, Gigiri, Runda, Ridgeways, Mathare North, Peponi and New Muthaiga. The western part of the forest is also known as Sigiria Forest.The area north of central Nairobi forms a drainage basin and was once heavily forested, but exists today only as patches like Karura Forest and City Park. The forest is cut by Thigirie, Getathuru, Rui Ruaka and Karura Rivers, all tributaries of Nairobi River.Features in the forest include a waterfall, bamboo forest, marshland, Mau Mau caves and an old church.The United Nations Office at Nairobi and UNEP headquarters are located adjacent to the forest. The Karura Forest Product Research Centre is also located there.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nWildlife in the forest include Monkey species (including recently re-introduced Colobus Monkeys), bush baby, bushbuck, bush pig, porcupine, duiker, genet, dik dik, African civet and East African epauletted fruit bat.Plant species typical to the forest include Olea europaea (var. africana), Croton megalocarpus, Warburgia ugandensis, Brachyleana huillensis and the Uvaridendron anisatum.\n\n\n== Development projects and environmental issues ==\nParts of the forest were degazetted by Minister of Environment Jeremiah Nyagah in 1989. Between 1994 and 1998 a total of 564.14 hectares of the forest were secretly allocated to 64 different companies for housing projects. Around 1995 there were plans to build a housing estate in the forest, but opposition by local residents led to temporary shelving of the plans.The projects revitalised again in September 1998, when the Forest Department was issued a quit notice by private developers. The clearing of the forest started igniting fierce protests by environmentalists and others concerned. On 7 October 1998 the construction site was invaded by demonstrators, including 12 opposition MP's. The protest turned violent and bulldozers and other machinery used to clear the forest was destroyed worth more than 80 million Ksh ($2 US million).Minister for Lands and Settlements Noah Katana Ngala released a list of companies who had been allocated land in Karura Forest in November 1998. However, the records of those companies were not found at Registrar General's office, making it difficult to trace the individuals behind these companies.On 8 January 1999 when a group of women led by Wangari Maathai were holding a demonstration by planting trees near the forest, a large group of security guards attacked them. Several of them were injured, including Maathai who was taken to Nairobi Hospital. The police were reluctant to investigate the incident. However, the Attorney-General Amos Wako apologised to Maathai and promised an inquiry on the incident.The Time Magazine, in support of Maathai, named her a Hero of the Week in 1998. Klaus T\u00f6pfer, the executive director of UNEP, warned that the organisation may move its headquarters out of Kenya if the forest faces destruction. The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also condemned the attack on Maathai. Architectural Association of Kenya asked in November 1998 Kenyan architects not to be involved with any design that would threaten the forestKenyan President Daniel arap Moi criticised the protesters and asked the Church not to involve itself with the saga. Minister for Natural Resources Francis Lotodo defended the projects in January 1999 stating that Nairobi as a growing city needed space for development. Professor R. A. Obudho of University of Nairobi, who specialises in urbanisation, also supported the projectsUniversity of Nairobi students held several demonstrations for preservation the forest. On 20 January 1999 several students were injured when they clashed with police. The University if Nairobi was closed temporarily following the protests, and all students were ordered to leave the campus. Opposition MP's James Orengo (Ford-Kenya), David Mwenje (DP) and Njehu Gatabaki (SDP) were charged in court for attending student protests.Eventually housing plans were taken down in lack of public support, but land allocations still stood in place.In 2003 the NARC government led by Mwai Kibaki replaced the long-standing Moi-led KANU-government. In 2003 the Minister of Environment Newton Kulundu denied the American investor Raymond Chisholm a permit to construct a hotel in the forest. Learning that the new government would revoke dubious KANU-era land allocations, developers started to relinquish their properties in the forestThe new Kenya Forests Act in 2005  made it more difficult to degazette forests in Kenya, thus protecting Karura Forest as wellThere was a project by Kenya Forest Service, UNEP and Red Cross Kenya in 2008 to cut down eucalyptus and blue gum trees in parts of the forest and plant indigenous species in their place. Green Belt Movement was doubtful with the project, fearing that logging of the forest could actually lead to private developers invading the forestIn 2009 it was reported that part of the forest had been allocated to the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). This plan was also opposed by Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement, who stated that the NEMA should be protecting, not destructing the forest.The Nairobi Northern Bypass road, constructed in 2009, passes through a wetland that contributes to one of the five Karura Forest water courses, thus posing a threat to the forest.Karura Forest had a reputation as dangerous spot. Muggings, robbery and violence were common. At one point, said Kenya Forest Service (KFS) Head of the Nairobi Conservancy, Charity Munyasia,  they were discovering one dead body there per fortnight, on average. The Chief Forester was actually mugged in his own forest.The new Kenya Forests Act (2005) also provided for the establishment of Community Forest Associations (CFA). In 2009 an initiative was thus formed under the name 'Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association'. Recognising the growing threats to Karura from uncontrolled development the neighbouring Muthaiga and Gigiri Residents Associations begin discussions in early 2009 to form a Community Forest Association for Karura. A letter of intent circulated to northern Nairobi neighbourhoods residents, heads of agencies and VIPs under joint signature of KFS and the Muthaiga Residents\u2019 Association (MRA). A stakeholders\u2019 Working Committee was formed to steer the process, and, in order to raise awareness, it organised a media event in the form of the opening of Karura's \u2018Family Trail\u2019 on 16 May 2009 with the Hon. Noah Wekesa, Minister for Forestry and Wildlife, presiding. Hundreds of stakeholders participated in walking the length of the trail. On 25 May 2009 KFS wrote a letter to the Registrar of Societies expressing No Objection to the registration of the new CFA. Between April and July 2009 FKF-CFA office-bearers completed the required vetting processes with the Criminal Investigation Division and Registrar of Societies. The FKF-KFS joint management plans were drafted by the Working Committee. On 1 October 2009 the Registrar of Societies signed the Certificate of Registration for the Friends of Karura Community Forest Association. At the First FKF Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2010 Alice Macaire became FKF's first elected chairperson.\nThe nascent and unique parastatal-stakeholder partnership took its first major management decision on 25 Feb 2010 when FKS and FKF signed an MOU concerning installation and operation of an electric fence to fully secure the forest perimeter. FKF raised the necessary funds and the fence was completed in September. In December 2010 the Strategic Management Plan signed by KFS Director D.K, Mbugua, and on 26\u201327 February 2011 there was a Grand Opening Ceremony in the forest to celebrate a Karura that was now \u2019Secure, Safe & Serene\u2019 and open for visitors.\nAt the second FKF Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2011. Prof. Karanja Njoroge, who had served as Wangari Maathai's deputy at the GreenBelt Movement, was elected to chairmanship of FKF.  Wangari Maathai and Alice Macaire were anointed as honorary Patrons of the Community Forest Association. Cristina Boelcke-Croze continued as vice-chair along with Judge Sharad Rao.\nThus, in only five years, the FKF Community Forest Association in partnership with the Kenya Forest Service and Kenyan corporate and private donors, fenced, secured and transformed Karura \"from the dumping site for hijackers and murderers and illegal private developers\"  into a popular local recreation and conservation site.  From literally zero visitors in 2009, the forest is now welcoming an average of 16,000 visitors a month, 70% of whom are Kenyan citizens. In 2015 there were some 600,000 visitors.A documentary  about the transformation of the forest, \" Rejuvenating The Karura Forest: Danger Spots to Green Haven,\" was produced by Duncan Ndotono and directed by Brenda Okoth,  recognised efforts being made to nurture Karura Forest back to life  \nThe Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association can be contacted at rafiki@karurafriends.org. Website: http://www.friendsofkarura.org\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nKarura Forest is now developed as a visitor's attraction, with some 16,000 entries per month. This includes creation of some 50 km of nature trails for walking, running and biking. The first trail, which is four kilometres long and connects Limuru Road with Old Kiambu Road was opened in May 2009. An electric fence has been built around the forest for security reasons. Although 70% of Karura's visitors are Kenyan citizens, there is a growing appreciation by an international clientele as witnessed by Karura having received a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence for two years running (2014\u201315) and being listed as No. 4 out of 101 Things To Do in Nairobi.The Karura Forest Environmental Education Trust (KFEET) was formed in 2010, and launched by then Minister for Forestry and Wildlife Noah Wekesa. KFEET manages an environmental education centre located in Karura Forest and facilitating access to thousands of Kenyan school children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKenya Forest Service\nFriends of Karura Forest\nKenya Ministry of Wildlife",

      "name": "Sheldrick Elephant & Rhino Orphanage",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates an orphan elephant rescue and wildlife rehabilitation program in Kenya. It was founded in 1977 by Dame Daphne Sheldrick to honor her late husband, David Sheldrick. Since 2001, it has been run by their daughter, Angela Sheldrick. \n\n\n== Mission ==\n\u201cThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust embraces all measures that complement the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife. These include anti-poaching, safe guarding the natural environment, enhancing community awareness, addressing animal welfare issues, providing veterinary assistance to animals in need, rescuing and hand rearing elephant and rhino orphans, along with other species that can ultimately enjoy a quality of life in wild terms when grown.\u201dThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust works closely with the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Kenya Forest Service and local communities to achieve their long term goal to secure safe havens for wildlife, through the effective management and protection of key ecosystems and wilderness areas in Kenya.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor over 25 years Kenya-born Daphne Sheldrick lived and worked alongside her husband, David Sheldrick, MBE, a naturalist and founding Warden of Tsavo East National Park. Throughout this time, they raised and successfully rehabilitated many wild animal species. Daphne Sheldrick\u2019s involvement with wildlife also spanned a lifetime, and she was a recognized international authority on the rearing of wild creatures. She was the first person to have perfected the milk formula and necessary husbandry for infant milk-dependent elephants, discovering that coconut oil was the nearest substitute for the fat in elephant milk. . \nAfter the death of her husband in 1977, Daphne and her family lived and worked in the Nairobi National Park, continuing David's legacy of conservation. In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial Appeal, a part of the African Wildlife Project, metamorphosed into the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust; becoming an independent non-profit organization.The organization re-branded their name and logo on February 1, 2019, changing their name from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust to the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in order to honor both David and Daphne Sheldrick.The number one long-term achievement of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is their success with raising orphaned baby elephants and integrating them back in the wild. The Trust is a leader in conservation efforts to help save the remaining African elephant populations in grave danger from the illegal ivory trade. \n\n\n== Foster program ==\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates a digital foster program which allows individuals across the world to support their field projects by fostering an orphaned elephant, rhino or giraffe in their care for themselves or as a gift. For a suggested donation of $50 per orphan per year, individuals receive via email: a personalised certificate, an interactive map, monthly update on the progress of their orphan and a watercolour by CEO Angela Sheldrick.All elephant, rhino and giraffe orphans rescued by the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust are available to foster, including those orphans living back in the wild, and proceeds benefit the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s conservation projects.\n\n\n== Visiting ==\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s Elephant Orphanage is located in Nairobi National Park, Kenya and is open to the public for one hour every day, excluding 25 December, from 11 am to noon. During this time the orphans arrive for their midday mud bath and feeding.  Entrance to the orphanage for the visiting hour requires minimum contribution of $7 US dollars / 500 Kenya shillings per person. A gift shop is on site and visitors can also set up a fostering during their visit.\n\n\n== Conservation projects ==\n\n\n=== Orphans project ===\nOn call every day of the year, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust travels throughout Kenya to rescue orphaned elephants and rhinos left alone with no hope of survival. Many of the orphans rescued are victims of poaching and human-wildlife conflict and are in a terrible state of emaciation and distress.After each orphan rescue, the long and complex process of rehabilitation begins at the DSWT\u2019s Nursery nestled within the Nairobi National Park. For milk-dependent elephant calves it is here, during this crucial phase, where they are cared for and healed both emotionally and physically by the DSWT\u2019s dedicated team of elephant Keepers who take on the role and responsibility of becoming each orphan\u2019s adopted family during their rehabilitation.Each elephant remains at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s Nursery in Nairobi National Park until they are ready to make the journey to one of three rehabilitation stockades at Voi or Ithumba in Tsavo East National Park , or at their Umani Springs Reintegration Unit. This second phase of rehabilitation can span a period of up to ten years as the orphaned elephants gradually transition back into the wild herds of Tsavo, taken at a pace determined by each individual elephant.\nTo date, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has successfully hand-raised over 200 infant elephants and reintegrated over 100 orphaned elephants back into the wild herds of Tsavo National Park. More than 25 wild born calves have been born to orphaned elephants raised in their care, living back in the wild.\n\n\n=== Anti-poaching teams ===\nTo combat ivory, bushmeat and rhino horn poaching, which are devastating wildlife populations, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates fully equipped Anti-Poaching Units in partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). By March 2017, the DSWT/KWS Units had made more than 2,800 arrests and removed in excess of 140,000 snares.\nTen Units protect the greater Tsavo Conservation Area covering a vast 60,000km2, whilst one fully mobile unit is operating throughout the country where it is needed the most. These fully trained frontline teams, accompanied by armed KWS Rangers, are equipped with vehicles, camping equipment, radios, GPS units and cameras, patrolling daily to combat elephant and rhino poaching as well as the threat of bushmeat snaring.Supporting these vital ground teams is a Rapid Response Anti-Poaching Unit operated by armed KWS rangers selected from the Service\u2019s top field recruits.\n\n\n=== Canine Unit ===\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates a specialist Canine Unit with three Belgian Malinois who have been trained to track and detect illegal wildlife products such as ivory, rhino horn and bush meat as well as guns and ammunition. The three canines are deployed to support the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s anti-poaching efforts and are accompanied by six fully trained handlers.\n\n\n=== Aerial surveillance ===\nSupporting the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s ground efforts is an Aerial Unit, which includes six aircraft and a helicopter, all of which are active in the field throughout the Tsavo ecosystem as well as within the Lamu District. Daily, the Aerial Unit takes part in security patrols and provides support to search and veterinary intervention for injured elephants and wildlife, as well as search and rescue operations for orphaned elephant calves and wildlife emergencies.Aerial reconnaissance is a vital tool in the effective prevention of illegal activities and the DSWT\u2019s combination of active ground teams and an \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 have resulted in many successes in preventing poaching attacks, apprehending poaching offenders and recovering tusks, whilst saving the lives of many injured elephants and other wildlife species due to poaching incidents.\n\n\n=== Mobile Veterinary Units ===\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates four fully equipped Mobile Veterinary Units and a Sky Vet initiative headed by Kenya Wildlife Service Vets to alleviate the suffering of injured wild animals. All four units are equipped with custom-made vehicles, darting hatches, equipment shelves, a fridge, an operating table and necessary medicines and equipment required for rapid and effective veterinary response to any cases.\nThe Tsavo Mobile Veterinary Unit based at the KWS Voi Headquarters, covers an extensive area including the greater Tsavo Conservation Area as well as the Chyulu Hills National Park and the Shimba Hills National Reserve.The Mara Mobile Veterinary Unit covers the Masai Mara National Reserve, the adjacent Mara Triangle, neighbouring community areas, as well as the Lake Naivasha and Nakuru areas within the Rift Valley; when needed the unit also operates as far West as Ruma National Park and Lake Victoria.The Meru Mobile Veterinary Unit operates out of Meru National Park and provides permanent veterinary support to the larger Meru ecosystem consisting of Meru National Park, Bisanadi National Park and Kora National Reserve, including all wildlife dispersal areas around the Eastern Conservation Area, whilst also extending its services into additional parks and reserves in the Northern Conservation Area.The Amboseli Mobile Veterinary Unit operates out of Amboseli National Park and services the Southern Conservation Area encompassing Kajiado, Namanga, Magadi, Lake Natron as well as the Southern Tsavo West area including Lake Jipe, an ecosystem famous for large number of elephants.The Sky Vet initiative funds and coordinates the deployment of KWS vets to emergency wildlife cases throughout Kenya by air and is a vital addition to the DSWT\u2019s veterinary program. Between Sky Vets and the four units over 1,500 wild elephants have been assisted and the lives of countless other species have been saved.\n\n\n=== Fencing ===\nWith agriculture and human settlement encroaching into wildlife habitats, disrupting migratory routes and protected boundaries, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been erecting and maintaining hundreds of kilometres of fencelines to limit this growing conflict over natural resources.\n\n\n=== Water provision for wildlife ===\nWith limited rainfall in the arid Tsavo Conservation Area, which in recent years has shown a drastic decline, arid areas such as Tsavo and Lamu are first to suffer from prolonged drought. To address this threat to the wildlife within these habitats, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has built 14 boreholes and windmills to enhance the dry season productivity, as well as instigating temporary water-relief programs to relieve suffering.\n\n\n=== Saving habitats ===\nBy securing Public-Private Partnerships with the Kenya Forest Service and Community Group Ranches, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is safeguarding unique and endangered wild habitats.\n\n\n==== Tsavo Conservation Area ====\nThe Trust owns 4,000 acres of land adjoining the Tsavo East National Park. This land, known as the Peregrine Conservation Area, is prime wildlife habitat and also serves as the DSWT field headquarters, providing support for all of the Trust\u2019s Tsavo-based projects.\n\n\n==== Kibwezi Forest ====\nIn partnership with the Kenya Forest Service, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has embarked on conserving and sustaining the environment in the Kibwezi Forest.\nThe Kibwezi Forest, one of Kenya\u2019s last remaining groundwater woodlands, is a unique ecosystem bordering the Chyulu Hills National Park and an exceptional biodiversity hotspot providing a habitat for a number of wildlife species, including the African elephant as well as an impressive collection of rare and endemic mammals, birds, reptiles, butterflies, invertebrates and fish.Conservation and protection programs in the area include natural resource management, anti-poaching patrols as well as the construction and maintenance of electrically fenced boundaries, ensuring the steady rehabilitation of the area whilst safeguarding the local communities and their livelihoods from wildlife damage. Other conservation activities taking place within the Kibwezi Forest include the monitoring of water extraction, fire control, invasive species control and key habitat and endangered species management, whilst providing benefits to the local communities through sustainable resource utilisation, education and tourism.\n\n\n=== Community outreach ===\nFor more than 15 years, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has operated a community outreach project, working to improve the livelihoods and educational standards of people living along the borders of Kenya\u2019s National Parks and protected areas through the introduction of community initiatives and local employment.Their initiatives include:\n-         Free field trips throughout the year into Tsavo East and West National Parks for schools living on the Parks borders.\n-         Tree Planting Programs. The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has developed three mature tree nurseries, producing thousands of saplings, which are distributed to local communities and schools, encouraging families and children to plant, nurture and protect their trees and forested areas to instil a better understanding of the value of their natural resources.\n-         Wildlife Film showings to local communities.-         Beehive fence lines. Since 2015, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been working with local communities inhabiting the north-western border of Tsavo East, to erect a 2.6 km long elephant-beehive fence with 131 beehives on seven forefront farms bordering the park.-         Funding of local radio programs in a variety of local languages, which promote wildlife education and feature DSWT field members speaking about their work and experiences.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPinnawala Elephant Orphanage, established in 1975 by the Sri Lanka Department of Wildlife Conservation\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBBC, Elephant Diaries: BBC - Science & Nature - Elephant Diaries\nBuchanan, Gordon (2016), Elephant Family And Me.

          "Amazing visit! yes it is crowded, yes it is hot in the sun, but we managed to get a front row spot under a tiny bit of shade and made the experience much better. The elephants get close and we even managed to pat one of the babies who came right up to the rope They came out in",
          "We learned so much about the plight of baby elephants because of poaching, droughts ...the babies were adorable, came so close to the visitors that we could touch them. Fantastic experience and highly recommended...",
          "This non-profit organization is so heartwarming, educational and fun. My grown children loved it and were completed captivated by the sweet baby elephants. A worthy cause!",
          "This was a great experience that was both educational and enjoyable. We learned a lot about the dangers facing elephants in the wild and about how this trust rescues elephants and later reintroduces them to their natural habitats. It is located on the outskirts of Nairobi and is",
          "We always take visitors to see the baby elephants here. Good value for money and such a worthy cause. Only an hour, which is easily doable.",
          "I sponsored a couple of the baby elephants before going to Kenya and I was very happy to see them in real life at this sanctuary. Nothing is more important than nature and it's life - elephant life is extra special",

          "Nothing could be more heartwarming than elefant babies having their bottles. They are sooo playful and sweet.",
          "Get there early to purchase your tickets, the queues can get quite long. It's a very popular tourist spot. Entrance fee is pretty reasonable as well. The staff do a great feeding show where the baby elephants are fed and actually walk around so you can touch them and maybe even",
          "So, if you plan to go to this place while you are on holiday in Kenya it is worth the time. It is only open for an hour a day and you get to see the elephants being fed. You will find a perfect view wherever you are situated when you enter the park and get the opportunity for",
          "On our recent trip with ESA Safaris we visited the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and we adopted an elephant. This is an incredible organization doing wonderful things for the orphaned animals. Please support by adopting these animals and aide in their care from afar.",
          "Fun experience seeing baby elephants rescued from the wild. They are re-released in 3-7 years. Very informative .",
          "Being up close and personal with the elephant calves was a lot of fun. Loved seeing the way they rush for their milk. It was like a cavalry charge.",
          "These are some of the best heroes in Kenya. I would highly recommend stopping by and supporting this beautiful refuge. They are bring back the elephants whose population was dwindling. Bravo to all of you!",
          "We had adopted an elephant so we got to go to the later visitors hour in the evening. It was great! We got to see them come rushing in from their day of exploring, then we could walk around and see them all in their enclosures. They are very well cared for and it was lovely to",
          "If you are in Nairobi and are free between 11am and 12pm you have to visit the Sheldrick to see the baby orphaned elephants. They are so cute and actually you get quite close (if you get there early enough you can stand VERY VERY close!) But what's most important is the good",
          "While it does seem odd that they walk the elephants out into a circle for the people to watch, it is nice to see them so close up. And seems they do good work helping the animals. The day we were there loads of school kids were on a field trip. Everyone enjoyed the",
          "This is almost free - $7 per person. Such an amazing experience and my boys were up close with these baby elephants. Please, if you go, respect the handlers who ask you to be quiet during the experience. The group I was with just couldn't manage that, despite being asked more",
          "David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust really is a place for #DoGoodHaveFun! Three 'levels' of interaction: 12 noon) Open to the public (we did not do) 3 PM) Open to those who have adopted and significant up-charge (not sure how much) but very exclusive and need significant advance time",
          "We had a lovely evening experience visiting the orphans after adopting one online. The babies are so playful and cute coming back home after a day in the park. It\u2019s a great learning experience to see the work the DSWT is doing and the passion it takes to get these babies back to",
          "Working in the animal welfare field, I was really interested to visit the trust and learn more about how they are protecting and saving elephants. The public is only allowed in for an hour and it is quite crowded, but so worth seeing the babies being bottle fed. The",
          "We adopted a baby elephant named Roho and went to visit the orphanage for their evening visit where we watched the orphans come in from the forest for the night and drink their evening milk. This place is amazing in what they do for the baby elephants. The also had a rhino",
          "Really loved spending 1h just visiting the elephants since I have been following their work for a while. It's the right thing to have those restrictions. If you have questions the keepers will answer them.",
          "Its a nice place to minimize a long day before your flight home.i will definitely recommend it to anyone willing to visit.",
          "This is a nice conservancy in nairobi for a free weekend to relax at. Feeding the baby elephants was a good experience . Good job to the animals.",

          "Brilliant insight into what the Wildlife Centre does for orphaned and rescued elephants. Certainly brightens your day when you see the elephants rush out from the fields for their feed. A must visit",
          "Usually a visitor favorite! I have been many times, taking visitors. Go at least 15 minutes (or more) early as the line is long, and you will want a spot on the fence to be close to the elephants. Wear a hat, as you will be standing in the sun for an hour. Probably will stay a",
          "As lover of elephants, the visit at David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was really a beautiful and emotional experience. My partner and I adopted Roho, the little elephant who is just arrived at the center and we had the opportunity to meet him and stay together for 1 hour. Great",
          "We have pictures of our children walking with young elephants and rhinos when we were last here over 25 years ago. Things have changed in terms of visiting but it\u2019s still a lovely place to visit and support the good work they are doing. Consider an extra donation over and above",
          "The Sheldrick Elephant Sanctuary is a must see when in Nairobi. The public is only allowed to be with the elephants for one hour (11am-12pm local) while they get fed. What\u2019s really exciting is that you can see the elephants racing toward the feeding area...they know what\u2019s",

          "The Wildlife trust does a great work in both rehabilitation and information on the greatest animal of Africa. You are able to get close and hear the storries and watch them play in the mud.",
          "I almost burst into tears when I saw this little fellas playing all around! was incredible! It was raining that day so the floor was reaaaaally muddy and hard to walk, be prepared with a pair of boot or something ! It\u00b4s not the politest place, people there are kinda .... rude?",
          "After entering at 11am, visitors are ushered to a small viewing area centered on a muddy watering hole. After a short while later, the animal handlers come in alongside several baby elephants. For the first part of the viewing, the handlers bottle-feed the baby elephants -What a",
          "I visited the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and I was heartbroken to learn about how poachers harms these beautiful animals and how elephants never forget anything, so they will always remember the trauma they've been through. At the same time, it was heartwarming to learn how",
          "I sponsor an elephant at the nursery and have known about this charity for a number of years. These poor orphans are visibly affected by the loss of their mother and some of the awful injuries, but are now safe and extremely well cared for. It is such an emotional experience",
          "You can only see the baby elephants for an hour, but it was so totally worth the full hour. These little (big) guys are so adorable, you get a story of each of them and they are hilarious to watch and sometime even get to pet. They are kinda like giant dogs playing around. It",

          "The one hour feeding with the baby elephants happens at 11 a.m, each day. That feeding is open to the public. It was a lovely experience and fun to watch the elephants finish their bottles and after graze on leaves. Each elephant had its own personality and name, and the",
          "If you adopt the elephants, then you can meet them up close in the late afternoon for an hour with other adopters. There are instructions on the website to contact them and make the arrangements. We got to touch them (the ones who let us anyway) and spent time going around",
          "Wow, where do I start. My friends and I have followed/supported the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust for quite a few years now and planned our trip to include numerous trips to the orphanage and their Voi Reintegration Unit. Our first visit was to the 11am public viewing. This was",
          "This was a wonderful place, met 17 orphaned elephants, a blind rhino and naughty giraffe. The people here who dedicate there time to these vulnerable orphans deserve every credit. It\u2019s a moving experience hearing their stories as all where brought in for their milk. We adopted",
          "We have visited on a number of occasions and never been disappointed. The 1100 feeding is a fun and informative experience, though can get very busy, but allows you to learn a lot about the elephant orphans and see them enjoy their lunchtime feed. Would rate that experience 4",
          "We started our East African Safari with a visit to the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. We were able to see the young elephants during feeding time and learned how they were kept and cared for until they were able to return to the wild. We were very happy to learn about this worthwhile",

          "David Sheldricks is a great place to learn more about Elephants. One gets to see them at a much closer range as opposed to driving through the park. The stories told about them by their keepers makes one want to connect with the environment in a very unique way. These elephants",
          "Was able to visit the trust on a tour in June of last year. What a wonderful place. Not only do you get to see the baby elephants feed, but you get time to watch them and get super close. These people are Angels! Taking care of these orphans is a cute and tough job and they",

          "We visited here after being in safari and wanted to meet roho the orphaned baby elephant my daughter very kindly sponsored for me. We went with a guide as we were visiting the giraffe centre and National park on the same day. The guide showed us how to afford the bun fight to",
          "I visited David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, that is a non-profit trust, in January 2020. It was a fantastic and unforgettable experience At 11 am, the 17 orphan baby elephants come with their keeper around a muddy waterhole. Baby elephants are aged from 1-month to 3 years old.",

          "Been several times and it's always so good. The babies are so cute. It never gets old. The sun can get a little hot sometimes but there is some shade, though not much. If you can, go during the week, perhaps not during school holidays if at all avoidable as it can get busy. But",

          "This was added on to our tour last minute and I'm so glad that change was made! We learned a lot about the elephants while observing them playing and being fed. I was actually able to pet a baby elephant and his skin didn't feel like I thought it would. I'm not quite sure what I",
          "David Sheldrick Wildlife is interesting because you are getting a lot of information about elephant and how they treat them, you can ask as many questions as you want. The only thing is that there are too many people around the elephant and only one hour to see them",
          "We enjoyed the hour spent and thought the information given was interesting. Great experience for all ages, but most little kids will have trouble staying interested the entire hour. Was so glad to get there in person after following on Instagram",
          "We had the privilege of visiting the orphanage as adopters. It was fantastic to actually see and learn up close and personally the amazing work done here. I think my favorite part was walking around and observing the elephants as they settled into their routines. They each had",
          "Donate $50 to adopt a baby elephant and you get to visit your baby elephant (and all other baby elephants) at 5pm daily. It's for a good cause and absolutely worth it! I got to pet my baby elephant, a one year old (Roho) who was rescued after his mom was killed by poachers.",
          "I went to the DSWT as part of a 3-stop day trip from Nairobi. The site opens to the public only from 11 to 12, hence you need to plan accordingly. Once on the site, you are provided with explanations about each elephant, the orphanage and the mission which, to my opinion, is",
          "Love the elephant orphanage! It\u2019s a must see in Nairobi , they have a talk and explain everything they do for orphaned elephants and explain the name of each elephant and how they came to be there, they help them grow up socialise with wild elephants to help release them back",
          "It was so nice to visit the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust - they open at 11 for one hour while they feed the elephants. The elephants are only babies so they are extremely adorable and playful. If you stand close to the rope barriers you can sometimes touch them. The staff give",
          "I went to Sheldrick after adopting one of their baby elephants -- it was an amazing experience to see the elephants up close, learn about the work they are doing, and talk to the truly saintlike men who care for these special creatures. Each elephant has its own keeper; they",
          "The David Sheldrick elephant orphanage is a must see and a great way to start your visit to Kenya. The love and care that goes into taking care of the baby elephants is amazing. I had chills when the baby elephants came out. The visit is only an hour but it\u2019s enough to watch and",
          "In the 1940s, the husband and wife team of David and Daphne Sheldrick helped set up the Tsavo National Park. They were among the pioneers of wildlife conservation in Kenya, and the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was set up on the outskirts of Nairobi, abutting the countryside, to",

          "This place was pretty cool! Only $5 and worth it IMO. They have 2 groups of elephants that come out and you\u2019ll have the chance to pet the elephants if they come near you. My tip is to get there early and stand near one of the mud/water puddles. May get a little dirty, but it\u2019s",
          "Much has been said already, so here's what our experience was like at the adopter visit: For ~US$50 you can adopt an orphan for a year, and this qualifies you to have an adopter visit separate from the standard 11a feeding experience. It does need to be booked in advance, you",
          "Great to see orphan elephants being rescued, cared for, and released back into the wild. Feeding time is at around 11am, after which the show is over, but it\u2019s fun to watch the young elephants feed from the bottle.",
          "Visiting these gentle giants is one of my favourite things to do in Nairobi. The Trust is well organised with strict visiting hours (currently 1 hour every day from 11am for public and 1 hour every day - subject to advance booking from 5pm for visitors who have adopted the",

          "The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust does amazing work caring for orphaned baby elephants all the way until they are old enough to be returned to the wild. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the elephant sanctuary. It is clear that this is a true sanctuary and not a money making gimmick. We enjoyed seeing the elephants and hearing their stories.",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit to see and learn about baby elephants. And the money for your visit helps rescue and reintroduce elephants to the wild. A special place!",
          "Wonderful spot! We adopted an orphaned elephant and went to the 5 pm session. The parade of orphaned elephants was fantastic! Don\u2019t be late. Reservations required.",
          "Not only cause it\u2019s a great experience but also a great cause. Should be compulsory on all Kenya visits!!",

          "I was completely overwhelmed with this amazing place. Despite the rain we had a lovely hour falling totally in love with all these gorgeous animals. This charity does the most phenominal work and it was very interesting hearing all the back stories of all the babies. Highlight",
          "A interesting experience for learning about elephants and the problems in the wild life; it\u2019s fun too",
          "What a special place! I had adopted an elephant and was able to go to the 5pm feeding and bedtime. It was nice because there was only about 25-30 of us. We were able to see the elephants run into the stockades (so adorable), as well as watch them eat, and speak to their",

          "We really loved the experience and the beautiful babies. Great job to the caregivers and the David Sheldrick foundation.",
          "It was a brief hour-long visit we drove to via Uber. The main focus of the center is not tourism, but animal rehabilitation. We received a solid description of the roles performed by the trust over PA while the elephants walked near the visitors. It was excellent to see",
          "Really nice to see the small elephants being taken care of in such a magnificent way. Well worth a visit when in Nairobi.",
          "It\u2019s actually okay. For real conservation education, much better to go to Ole Pajeta near Nanyuki. Took my preschool boys. They liked it the first time but weren\u2019t interested in going back after seeing real families in the Tsavo and the conservation projects at ole pajeta.",
          "Good place to go to understand how they are looking after the elephant orphans, and ensuring they get back into the wild. Yes a bit of a queue, but they do well to get you all in, and its managed so that it doesn't impact the elephants. Worth a trip if you are visiting the area.",
          "Quite informative and interesting attraction , but the management of the trust has failed to offer commensurate facilities to the visiting tourists either by default or lack of interest. The entrance to the orphanage is quite a haphazard affair due lack of planning. Instead of",
          "I have been a long time supporter of this organization, and will continue to be as long as I\u2019m standing and breathing! The work they have done, not only in rescuing elephant orphans, but many other animals, is just astonishing! Their commitment to helping stave off poachers",
          "What they are doing here is a wonderful thing, but not the best tourist experience with it being so many people in such a small space. If you get there at least an hour early, it would greatly enhance the experience, but otherwise I'd spend your time elsewhere.",
          "Elephant orphanage was very fun. Very crowded but our guide took us right to the front and knew where to stand to see the best and get to pet the elephants. Also fed giraffes and took us to an interesting out of the way restaurant. Great day.",
          "We adopted 2 baby elephants prior to our visit to Nairobi (we are big supporters of wildlife rescue groups--and were intrigued by the idea of meeting our \"babies\" in person!). After we adopted our babies--Maktao and Kiasa--I contacted Sheldrick to set up a visit with other",

          "Love, is the first feeling when you see the gentle giants in front of you. So large yet so playful. Just like human children, they are mischievous and playful too and they want your attention. The orphanage takes good care of these elephant calves and unlike others I have been",

          "Make this a part of your Nairobi to do list. When those babies come charging down the hill to get their bottles, it\u2019s hilarious! And the staff does a tremendous job telling you about the individual babies and how they ended up there. You get to be close enough to touch them; oh",
          "Viewing the elephant orphanage is a different experience from the Safaris and national parks. You get to hear the story of the orphaned elephants and it's quite moving. They are so cute as they play in the red mud. It really made me and my family feel more compassion for",

          "Visited here and saw the baby elephants that have been saved from a variety of unfortunate situations some natural, some man made. The 1 hour that it opens every day means inevitably it is very busy but the sight of the elephants was very special for my kids who have adopted one",

          "What wonderful work this place and people do! The visit was very worth while, very educating and opening peoples eyes to the fight against ivory markets. So sad to know that all the little elephants were left orphaned because of mankind in some way. At the same time we were so",
          "We visited in the morning where we learnt a lot about the elephant orphans, and were also entertained by a warthog that sneaked in between the elephants. Since we a adopted a rhino, we were also able to make the afternoon visit which is a very different experience where you see",
          "Very interesting, the explanations are quite good and the baby elephants so 'cute'! Very nice experience. I recommend",
          "A must see if you are in Nairobi. Orphaned elephants are hand raised fr up to 4 years when they are relocated back into the bush. Wonderful experience.",

          "This was a fantastic experience. The Elephant orphanage is just fun to watch. The elephants run out to meet their care takers, who stay with them until they are release to the wild AND accepted into an elephant herd. They have special milk they feed the elephants. And, you",
          "The trip is only for an hour. Two groups of young elephants come into the ring, are fed, play around for a bit and then go out again. They are lovely and some great photo opportunities Very worthwhile work being done here.",
          "This was just about ok. If you have already seen elephants earlier there is nothing here...Just a few baby elephants who come up to drink milk..Of course the important message is the good stuff they are doing for abandoned elephants..Personally I did not find anything great",
          "To see these magnificent animals, orphaned for r natural or subversive reasons, being cared for until they can return to the wild warmed my heart. I observed the obvious dedication of the staff to their charges as they raise them to an age where they can be transferred to",
          "If you have the time this is a stop worth your time. This facility for years has been caring for and releasing orphaned elephants. An opportunity to get up close and personal with baby elephants. The staff are incredibly dedicated to the task of caring for these noble creatures.",
          "Interesting place, seeing the baby elephants and rhino up close was really fun. Note it\u2019s only open 1 hour each day.",
          "Thought this might be a nice was to spend a few hours in Nairobi, but boy was i wrong. Better go to a zoo in your home town than be herded like elephants (pun intended) to this second rate tourist spot. Maybe they are doing a nice thing, but it seems like a hustle for tourist",
          "I am very pleased we went to the sanctuary. The work being done in saving the baby elephants at risk is wonderful. Elephants are released to Tsavo Park once old enough to survive. The visit was very informative and enjoyable.",

          "The tireless,timelesa work and sacrifice being administered to the orphan elephants is beyond words can express,its so heart touching to see young elephant given a second chance to live courtesy of Sheldricks",
          "You need to get there well before feeding to secure a good vantage point. I found some late arrivals were very aggressive at pushing to the front and displacing early arrivals, hence my rating of good rather than excellent. Once the babies start coming down it is wonderful to",
          "Get there at least an hour before the feeding and don't trust later arrivals to politely sit behind early arrivals. You definitely want to be at the front of the herd for pics and perhaps a chance to pet one of the orphans.",
          "I have been wanting to visit this place since I first learned of it some years ago. I adopted a baby and met him and it was magical.",
          "Very moving to watch these baby orphans who have been traumatized (mothers killed, lost, sick) being cared for by keepers so they can be returned to the wild and live a natural life. While the keepers feed the elephants, an informative and educational presentation is given so",
          "The orator was very knowledgeable, provided very useful insight and encouraged questions from the audienct. Tip: arrive early so that you can get right next to the rope fence and you will likely be able to touch small elephants as they walk by",
          "This place is wonderful. I encourage everyone to watch the movie, Born to Be Wild as this video really encompasses what you will be seeing at the Sheldrick Wildlife center. Wonderful opportunity to see baby elephants, a giraffe, and a rhino. There are warthogs wondering around",
          "They do such important work here, and there is so much to learn about Kenyan wildlife, the needs of baby elephants, and what it takes to save the environment from further destruction. Highly recommended, and do yourself a favour, sponsor one or more of the elephants so you get",
          "This is a total reap off. They are just making money in the name of conservation. Very disappointing.",
          "What a fun morning we had at the orphanage! The baby elephants are such a delight, playing in the mud, teasing each other, trumpeting...I could watch them for hours! We also thought that we were given a lot of important information by the keeper who was doing the presentation",
          "Let me preface this review with the fact that I have read all of Dame Daphne Sheldrick\u2019s books and am a foster of several elephants here. Needless to say it was a dream come true for me to visit this orphanage and it did not disappoint. They bring the baby elephants out in two",
          "Wonderful experiance where you can see your dollar going into conservation, which is rare in Africa. Its usually directed who knows where. Great to see so many animals being cared for pproperly",
          "The Trust does incredible work saving orphaned elephants. They provide rehabilitation and reintroduction for many young elephants and they go to great lengths to save orphaned elephants and injured animals. We watched them feed the baby elephants with bottles and while this",
          "The elephants were so cute! There were 14 baby elephants at the site. We were able to touch the elephants.",
          "Learn about the work to keep the elephant population growing in Africa. The elephants are adorable, and the keepers who care for them should be highly commended.",
          "A worthwhile cause to help the Elephants has turned in to a big tourist attraction but not without problems. It was a pretty hot day, no shade and no where to sit. Standing 4 deep around the enclosure was useless as far a seeing anything. Disappointingly an uncomfortable waste",
          "Having been a supporter of Sheldrick Wildlife Trust for a decade, I cannot speak highly enough of the organization. In addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and returning to the wild orphaned elephants, rhinos and giraffes, they also work with Kenya Wildlife Service to remove",
          "The only way to see elephants in Nairobi. They get some milk and you get to hear how the orphanage and the process of adopting one elephant work. That's about it. Very crowded as it is only open for 1h. It costs 600ks, only cash, but they also accept euro and usd.",
          "Have visited multiple times over the past decade. It's very nice to see how the orphaned elephants are cared for by the dedicated staff. Very nice to adopt an elephant and get the monthly (?) email, which is basically a standard, default, piece of text with the name of \"your\"",
          "If you sponsor an elephant (great cause to support) and book in advance, you can visit in the early evening as the elephants are coming home to go to bed. Its a joy to see them so happy - running back from the national park to their stables where dedicated keepers are waiting",

          "We almost didn't visit this foundation because I had felt like it was going to be too 'touristy'. Yes, there are plenty of tourists watching the elephants eat, play, and bathe. But it was just so interesting to see the young elephants interact with each other and to learn",
          "Went to see the how well the Elephants were looked after and was not disappointed. !4 young elephants kept at the trust which will be returned to the wild when they are ready. The trust is only opened for an hour so there is not a lot of interaction with humans.",

          "This is an amazing experience. The Sheldrick Trust raises orphaned elephants until they can go back to the wild. I foster 3 babies so was able to visit them in the evening when they come back from the bush with their keepers. I highly recommend visiting the Sheldrick elephant",

          "I know this place for the past 25 years so my memories from the past were better. The Sheldricks ladies did a fantastic job over these years taking care of the orphans. Sadly, it became a very commercial place, with hundreds of obnoxious tourists. However, still worth to",

It\u2019s only open between 11am-12 pm and it\u2019s super popular with lots of visitors/ tourists so make sure you get in the queue early so that you get a good spot to see the baby elephants getting fed!

          "OH my, to go to this wonderful orphanage of young elephants is a chance to have some optimism for the future of elephants. To see these young elephants come running when it is bottle time, is pure bliss! These young elephants would not have made it in the wild without help.Now",

          "Well worth a visit. We saw 13 baby elephants in two groups and were told their life stories and how they came to be at the elephant orphanage. Rather too many seem to get stuck down wells - perhaps an new well design is needed in the areas the elephants most often get trapped.",
          "Make sure you look at the material on the website in detail before you go, so you understand what this will be like. Many of the negative reviewers obviously didn't do their research. This is not a petting zoo, you don't get the opportunity to truly interact with the animals.",

          "We booked a private driver to take us to the Orphanage and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was a great introduction to conservation efforts in Kenya and a chance to get up close and if lucky personal with these young elephants. Take some water and wear a hat if the sun is",
          "You have to be here at 11am for the 1 hour show of the baby elephants feeding. It\u2019s only on once per day. They are very cute and you get to pat them if they come close. The foundation does wonderful work in saving these beautiful animals.",

          "We (my parents and I) went to the elephant orphanage for the hour-long elephant feeding visit. It was undeniably fun to see the elephants playing and draining their milk bottles in less than 20 seconds. For $5 each (plus a cheap Bolt or Uber ride) it was worth it. Just don't",

          "A very overcrowded place. I could hardly see the hour-long feeding program. It is for a wonderful cause.",
          "This place is definitely well worth a visit. The small entrance fee of 500 Kenyan Shillings per person goes towards the care of the orphaned elephants as well as funds from shop sales of souvenirs. There is also a chance to sponsor an orphan to maintain the trust's project.",
          "They are doing great work but it\u2019s still captivity. Donate to the cause but go on safari. Elephants in the wild are so prevalent there is no need to go other than to support them in their cause to save orphans",

          "It\u2019s only opened for 1 hour and therefore it attracts a huge crowd for that hour. If crowded tourist traps bother you don\u2019t go but I am impressed and feel the work they do is essential, as this is how they fund the great work ... I therefore have no problem hanging out looking"

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region. Successful artists based in Nairobi include Jua Cali, Nonini, Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and Nameless. Popular Record labels include Ogopa DJs, Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, Calif Records and Bornblack Music Group.\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi.

Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.\nNairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in Kenya producing DJs as well as producers like Jack Rooster, Euggy, DJ Fita, Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM. Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including Diplo, Major Lazer, Kyau & Albert, Solarity, Ronski Speed, and Boom Jinx.\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations. These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5 As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.Gospel music is also very popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artistes having a great impact in the mostly Christian city. Artistes such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, have a great pull over the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat have great influence over the younger generation. Their concerts are also very popular and they have as much influence as the great secular artistes. The most popular are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.\nMusical group Sauti Sol performed for U.S. President Barack Obama when he was in the city for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the Moi International Sports Centre in the suburb of Kasarani. The complex was completed in 1987, and was used to host the 1987 All Africa Games. The complex comprises a 60,000 seater stadium, the second largest in the African Great Lakes (after Tanzania's new national stadium), a 5,000 seater gymnasium, and a 2,000 seater aquatics centre.The Nyayo National Stadium is Nairobi's second largest stadium renowned for hosting global rugby event under the \"Safaricom Sevens.\" Completed in 1983, the stadium has a capacity of 30,000. This stadium is primarily used for football. The facility is located close to the Central Business District, which makes it a convenient location for political gatherings.\nNairobi City Stadium is the city's first stadium, and used for club football. Nairobi Gymkhana is the home of the Kenyan cricket team, and was a venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Notable annual events staged in Nairobi include Safari Rally (although it lost its World Rally Championship status in 2003), Safari Sevens rugby union tournament, and Nairobi Marathon.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the city by viewership and participation. This is highlighted by the number of football clubs in the city, including Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards, Tusker and Mathare United.\nThere are six golf courses within a 20 km radius of Nairobi. The oldest 18-hole golf course in the city is the Royal Nairobi Golf Club. It was established in 1906 by the British, just seven years after the city was founded. Other notable golf clubs include the Windsor Country Club, Karen Country Club, and Muthaiga Golf Club. The Kenya Open golf tournament, which is part of the European Tour, takes place in Nairobi. The Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi is the centre of horse racing in Kenya.Rugby is also a popular sport in Nairobi with 8 of the 12 top flight clubs based here.\nBasketball is also a popular sport played in the city's srimary, Secondary and college leagues.

There are also Muslim mosques including Jamia Mosque.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe majority of schools follow either the Kenyan Curriculum or the British Curriculum. There is also International School of Kenya and Rosslyn Academy, both of which follow the North American Curriculum, Swedish school in N'gong, and the German school in Gigiri.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nNairobi is home to several Universities and Colleges.\n\nThe University of Nairobi is the largest and oldest university in Kenya. It was established in 1956, as part of the University of East Africa, but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.South Eastern Kenya University is a constituent college of the University of Nairobi.\nKenyatta University is situated 16 km (9.9 mi) from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\nStrathmore University started in 1961 as an Advanced Level (UK) Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\nUnited States International University \u2013 Nairobi was originally a branch of the United States International University, but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\nIn 2005, The Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nThe Catholic University of Eastern Africa located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\nThe Technical University of Kenya (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only Technical University in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by Mwai Kibaki in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies.\nKCA University (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\nThe Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\nPan African Christian University is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\nEast Africa Institute of Certified Studies (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\nCompugoal College\nRiara University on Mbagathi road.\nUmma University is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.Numerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899. A population projection in the 21st century is listed below.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nNairobi is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife.\nDespite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew\u2014it had 14,000 residents by 1910\u2014conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe park covers an area of 117.21 km2 (45.26 sq mi) and is small in comparison to most of Africa's national parks. The park's altitude ranges between 1,533 and 1,760 m (5,030 and 5,774 ft). It has a dry climate. The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem. The park has a diverse range of habitats and species.The park is located about 7 km (4.3 mi) from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe park's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include African buffalo, baboon, eastern black rhinoceros, gazelle, Grant's zebra, cheetah, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotamus, African leopard, lion, common eland, impala, Masai giraffe, ostrich, vultures and waterbuck.Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.\n\nThe David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means \"Rhinoceros Sanctuary\". It is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nMervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.\n\n\n== Tourism and education ==\nNairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week.The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrett, Michael; Christine Riley (1995).

          "We have visited on a number of occasions and never been disappointed. The 1100 feeding is a fun and informative experience, though can get very busy, but allows you to learn a lot about the elephant orphans and see them enjoy their lunchtime feed. Would rate that experience 4",

          "David Sheldricks is a great place to learn more about Elephants. One gets to see them at a much closer range as opposed to driving through the park. The stories told about them by their keepers makes one want to connect with the environment in a very unique way. These elephants",
          "Was able to visit the trust on a tour in June of last year. What a wonderful place. Not only do you get to see the baby elephants feed, but you get time to watch them and get super close. These people are Angels! Taking care of these orphans is a cute and tough job and they",

          "David Sheldrick Wildlife is interesting because you are getting a lot of information about elephant and how they treat them, you can ask as many questions as you want. The only thing is that there are too many people around the elephant and only one hour to see them",
          "We enjoyed the hour spent and thought the information given was interesting. Great experience for all ages, but most little kids will have trouble staying interested the entire hour. Was so glad to get there in person after following on Instagram",

          "This place was pretty cool! Only $5 and worth it IMO. They have 2 groups of elephants that come out and you\u2019ll have the chance to pet the elephants if they come near you. My tip is to get there early and stand near one of the mud/water puddles. May get a little dirty, but it\u2019s",
          "Much has been said already, so here's what our experience was like at the adopter visit: For ~US$50 you can adopt an orphan for a year, and this qualifies you to have an adopter visit separate from the standard 11a feeding experience. It does need to be booked in advance, you",
          "Great to see orphan elephants being rescued, cared for, and released back into the wild. Feeding time is at around 11am, after which the show is over, but it\u2019s fun to watch the young elephants feed from the bottle.",

          "We really loved the experience and the beautiful babies. Great job to the caregivers and the David Sheldrick foundation.",
          "It was a brief hour-long visit we drove to via Uber. The main focus of the center is not tourism, but animal rehabilitation. We received a solid description of the roles performed by the trust over PA while the elephants walked near the visitors. It was excellent to see",
          "Really nice to see the small elephants being taken care of in such a magnificent way. Well worth a visit when in Nairobi.",

          "Good place to go to understand how they are looking after the elephant orphans, and ensuring they get back into the wild. Yes a bit of a queue, but they do well to get you all in, and its managed so that it doesn't impact the elephants. Worth a trip if you are visiting the area.",

          "What they are doing here is a wonderful thing, but not the best tourist experience with it being so many people in such a small space. If you get there at least an hour early, it would greatly enhance the experience, but otherwise I'd spend your time elsewhere.",

          "Viewing the elephant orphanage is a different experience from the Safaris and national parks. You get to hear the story of the orphaned elephants and it's quite moving. They are so cute as they play in the red mud. It really made me and my family feel more compassion for",

          "When we arrived at the elephant place myself and my daughter were asked to hand over ten dollars for which we received no receipt. There were about 200 people at our session - a lot of money went into their hands for which there was absolutely no paper trail. I will be alerting",
          "Was a true discovery of amazingly and concerned personnel for wildlife and conservancy. Must visit and experienced true nature",
          "Really enjoy coming here and seeing part of the excellent work done by The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. We adopted another elephant (Ziwadi) and hope to go back soon to she how she is getting on.",

          "This is my fourth time here. I love it. you never know what the babies will do. Very entertaining. Went with friend and his family of four. Get there an hour early so you can get by the ropes.",

          "Really excellent way to spend an hour. Not usually my cup of tea but well presented and obviously they think about the animals",
          "Visited here and saw the baby elephants that have been saved from a variety of unfortunate situations some natural, some man made. The 1 hour that it opens every day means inevitably it is very busy but the sight of the elephants was very special for my kids who have adopted one",
          "I appreciated that keeper gave a story of each elephant. I didn't qute get the part with option for adoption.",
          "Booked in the afternoon to see our baby elephant Mukkoka that we adopted last year. What a magical experience seeing all the babies running back to get their evening bottle of milk. The keepers were in their enclosures with them and so were able to ask a few questions. Seeing",
          "As a general rule, when on safari, I don't enjoy Zoo type environments as much as being out in the safari vehicles seeing the animals roaming free. This was definitely an exception. All the elephants here were orphaned and would have not have survived in the wild, but here,",
          "Went there twice to see orphans in dec . Visit by appointment. Enjoyed the visit. Saw the orphans elephants. They take good care of them. Caretakers very informative n took very good care of orphans. Our family very happy to adopt these orphans as sheldrick is genuine in",

          "Loved the babies. They are adorable. Only $8 USD. Keep in mind they are open only for 1hr a day 11:00-12:00. It's not fully interactive. There is a rope separating you from the elephants but if they come to you, you can pet them. Downside was all the screaming children. The",
          "We had a wonderful time watching the orphan elephants and learning about them. The children loved touching them after overcoming their initial fear. Really wonderful to be there.",

          "Adopted an elephant a few months back and was delighted to be able to go and meet him while we were in Kenya. They open until 12pm but foster parents are allowed to book in for feeding time at 5pm. It wasnt too busy so was perfect there was a lot of elephants being cared for as",
          "One of the best experiences in Nairobi. Truly inspirational and important work that has been done with excellence for years! Guides are great and the whole experience is very informative. A must do when in the area for sure!",
          "David Sheldrick Trust is an organisation that take cares of baby elephants that have been abandoned or their families have been killed by poachers (human wildlife conflict). Here you will be able to interact with the baby elephants and you get a chance to adopt an elephant too.",
          "Have been there the 3rd time on a Sunday with a group of guests. The show is informative, getting a bit boring when you join it not for the 1st time (repetitive) but great for people who where never exposed to elephants. Always very busy (too busy).",
          "It's an amazing place to visit with friends and family, everyone gets equal treatment and the service is impeccable. it's also a fun place to go to. This is also because they support a great cause",
          "Excellent couple of hours spent here. Lots to learn about elephant orphans. You can even adopt one! Great story as well behind the trust",
          "This place is only open for an hour a day to the public to keep the stress on the baby elephant to a minimum. Two groups of baby orphaned elephants were brought to a large enclosure to be fed with bottles of baby milk. A very knowledgeable elephant keeper talked about how they",
          "I was surprised at how close we got to the gorgeous elephants - close enough to touch many of them. And there was more than enough room for everyone to get a great view. Even through all the rain and mud, it was a fantastic experience.",
          "The baby elephants were amazing! They bring out 3 at a time & bottle feed them near where you stand. Recommend you visit.",
          "Amazing place to visit if you're in Nairobi for the day.... incredible organization. They offer morning visits to the public at 11am daily, and then evening visits for those who are foster parents. You can also make a donation to have a private visit with the elephants and",
          "Just go and see this fantastic conservation project. Adopt your elephant now! Young or old, just go there!",
          "Highly recommended. You gotta visited when you visit Nairobi; Kind orphan elephants that shows their kinds and you will feel their warm spirits soon you seem them.",
          "The Sanctuary is currently home to 18 orphan elephants that have been rescued for a number of reasons. I am always skeptical about visiting these types of places thinking they are \u201ctourist traps\u201d but I had read a lot of positive reviews so went to check it out. There was already",
          "What a great job these guys do. The elephants are given so much love and care. It was a pleasure to support such a good cause",
          "Sheldrick is such an amazing organization. The staff care so much about the elephants and really dedicate their time to helping the orphans.",
          "Visited the sheldrick wildlife trust on our trip to Kenya. We attended the 11am and the 5pm visits. The 11am if you get there slightly before hand you will easily get a spot at the ropes and viewing for the most part in all areas is good. The elephants run, play, eat and roll in",
          "Had an opportunity to visit this place with my friend and got to know about elephants. They basically care for the baby elephants with no parents either after their parents were killed by poachers in hunt of tusks or what not. A very beautiful place with so much wildlife",
          "You def have to go visit the orphanage. It was such a wonderful, eye opening experience to see how they take care of the elephants!! All the effort and energy these people do to take care of them is inspiring!! If you can, adopt an elephant. The money will help them a lot to",
          "This place is so great!! They are doing amazing things and letting people enjoy the area while doing so. For 50 dollars you can adopt an elephant and take it home with you (well actually just a watercolor picture of it but still) This is a must. Just make sure you are there by",
          "What wonderful work this place and people do! The visit was very worth while, very educating and opening peoples eyes to the fight against ivory markets. So sad to know that all the little elephants were left orphaned because of mankind in some way. At the same time we were so",
          "We visited in the morning where we learnt a lot about the elephant orphans, and were also entertained by a warthog that sneaked in between the elephants. Since we a adopted a rhino, we were also able to make the afternoon visit which is a very different experience where you see",
          "Very interesting, the explanations are quite good and the baby elephants so 'cute'! Very nice experience. I recommend",
          "A must see if you are in Nairobi. Orphaned elephants are hand raised fr up to 4 years when they are relocated back into the bush. Wonderful experience.",
          "We booked this safari during last minute actually 4 hours prior our flight back home and we really enjoyed and all thanks to Mueni from Ntwali Time travel safaris",
          "Enjoyed the company of cute baby elephants while at the same time contributing to their care. Highly recommend a visit!",
          "This was a fantastic experience. The Elephant orphanage is just fun to watch. The elephants run out to meet their care takers, who stay with them until they are release to the wild AND accepted into an elephant herd. They have special milk they feed the elephants. And, you",
          "The trip is only for an hour. Two groups of young elephants come into the ring, are fed, play around for a bit and then go out again. They are lovely and some great photo opportunities Very worthwhile work being done here.",
          "This was just about ok. If you have already seen elephants earlier there is nothing here...Just a few baby elephants who come up to drink milk..Of course the important message is the good stuff they are doing for abandoned elephants..Personally I did not find anything great",
          "To see these magnificent animals, orphaned for r natural or subversive reasons, being cared for until they can return to the wild warmed my heart. I observed the obvious dedication of the staff to their charges as they raise them to an age where they can be transferred to",
          "If you have the time this is a stop worth your time. This facility for years has been caring for and releasing orphaned elephants. An opportunity to get up close and personal with baby elephants. The staff are incredibly dedicated to the task of caring for these noble creatures.",
          "Interesting place, seeing the baby elephants and rhino up close was really fun. Note it\u2019s only open 1 hour each day.",
          "Thought this might be a nice was to spend a few hours in Nairobi, but boy was i wrong. Better go to a zoo in your home town than be herded like elephants (pun intended) to this second rate tourist spot. Maybe they are doing a nice thing, but it seems like a hustle for tourist",
          "I am very pleased we went to the sanctuary. The work being done in saving the baby elephants at risk is wonderful. Elephants are released to Tsavo Park once old enough to survive. The visit was very informative and enjoyable.",
          "Seeing the orphan baby elephants rushing to be fed was a lovely experience. Full marks to the centre for their work to raise and then release them",
          "The tireless,timelesa work and sacrifice being administered to the orphan elephants is beyond words can express,its so heart touching to see young elephant given a second chance to live courtesy of Sheldricks",
          "You need to get there well before feeding to secure a good vantage point. I found some late arrivals were very aggressive at pushing to the front and displacing early arrivals, hence my rating of good rather than excellent. Once the babies start coming down it is wonderful to",
          "Get there at least an hour before the feeding and don't trust later arrivals to politely sit behind early arrivals. You definitely want to be at the front of the herd for pics and perhaps a chance to pet one of the orphans.",
          "I have been wanting to visit this place since I first learned of it some years ago. I adopted a baby and met him and it was magical.",
          "Very moving to watch these baby orphans who have been traumatized (mothers killed, lost, sick) being cared for by keepers so they can be returned to the wild and live a natural life. While the keepers feed the elephants, an informative and educational presentation is given so",
          "The orator was very knowledgeable, provided very useful insight and encouraged questions from the audienct. Tip: arrive early so that you can get right next to the rope fence and you will likely be able to touch small elephants as they walk by",
          "This place is wonderful. I encourage everyone to watch the movie, Born to Be Wild as this video really encompasses what you will be seeing at the Sheldrick Wildlife center. Wonderful opportunity to see baby elephants, a giraffe, and a rhino. There are warthogs wondering around",
          "They do such important work here, and there is so much to learn about Kenyan wildlife, the needs of baby elephants, and what it takes to save the environment from further destruction. Highly recommended, and do yourself a favour, sponsor one or more of the elephants so you get",
          "This is a total reap off. They are just making money in the name of conservation. Very disappointing.",
          "What a fun morning we had at the orphanage! The baby elephants are such a delight, playing in the mud, teasing each other, trumpeting...I could watch them for hours! We also thought that we were given a lot of important information by the keeper who was doing the presentation",
          "Let me preface this review with the fact that I have read all of Dame Daphne Sheldrick\u2019s books and am a foster of several elephants here. Needless to say it was a dream come true for me to visit this orphanage and it did not disappoint. They bring the baby elephants out in two",
          "Wonderful experiance where you can see your dollar going into conservation, which is rare in Africa. Its usually directed who knows where. Great to see so many animals being cared for pproperly",
          "The Trust does incredible work saving orphaned elephants. They provide rehabilitation and reintroduction for many young elephants and they go to great lengths to save orphaned elephants and injured animals. We watched them feed the baby elephants with bottles and while this",
          "The elephants were so cute! There were 14 baby elephants at the site. We were able to touch the elephants.",
          "Learn about the work to keep the elephant population growing in Africa. The elephants are adorable, and the keepers who care for them should be highly commended.",
          "A worthwhile cause to help the Elephants has turned in to a big tourist attraction but not without problems. It was a pretty hot day, no shade and no where to sit. Standing 4 deep around the enclosure was useless as far a seeing anything. Disappointingly an uncomfortable waste",
          "Having been a supporter of Sheldrick Wildlife Trust for a decade, I cannot speak highly enough of the organization. In addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and returning to the wild orphaned elephants, rhinos and giraffes, they also work with Kenya Wildlife Service to remove",
          "The only way to see elephants in Nairobi. They get some milk and you get to hear how the orphanage and the process of adopting one elephant work. That's about it. Very crowded as it is only open for 1h. It costs 600ks, only cash, but they also accept euro and usd.",
          "Have visited multiple times over the past decade. It's very nice to see how the orphaned elephants are cared for by the dedicated staff. Very nice to adopt an elephant and get the monthly (?) email, which is basically a standard, default, piece of text with the name of \"your\"",
          "If you sponsor an elephant (great cause to support) and book in advance, you can visit in the early evening as the elephants are coming home to go to bed. Its a joy to see them so happy - running back from the national park to their stables where dedicated keepers are waiting",
          "This place guarantees the future of tourism in Kenya. The facility offers a wonderful opportunity for one to ever see an elephant up close and touch it.",
          "The best place you can ever have to touch the skin texture of an elephant,otherwise out there don't dare.",
          "Adopt a baby elephant. A few dollars and you can visit the elephants as an adopter at other times. Got an Uber to the Orphanage...a little way out but mainly due to state of roads.",
          "I read Dame Sheldrik's Biography before I went to Kenya and suggest that ALL of the adults reading this do, too. It fills in, actually overflows, the goodness of her spirit that saved so many infant animals and teaches us to continue following her example. There can be nothing",
          "We almost didn't visit this foundation because I had felt like it was going to be too 'touristy'. Yes, there are plenty of tourists watching the elephants eat, play, and bathe. But it was just so interesting to see the young elephants interact with each other and to learn",
          "Went to see the how well the Elephants were looked after and was not disappointed. !4 young elephants kept at the trust which will be returned to the wild when they are ready. The trust is only opened for an hour so there is not a lot of interaction with humans.",
          "Great experience with the Baby elephants. The queu line to the entrance very disorganized. If you have children do not doubt and go.",
          "As always a wonderful visit and experience! Highly recommend this Trust as they do an amazing job rescuing and healings these orphans and returning them to the wild where they belong.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the up close experience and knowing that we helped save orphaned elephants. Get there before 11 so you can be towards the front of the line when entering and then get a better position to view",
          "We had always wanted to go to the Trust but it is only open 1 hour a day 11-12. This trip we changed our plans so we could get there. To see the interaction of the elephants and their care givers is wonderful. You can touch them if they get close enough to you. I would",
          "Having seen giraffe at a distance in Masse Mara it was such a delight to see ( and feed) these beautiful creatures... a great way to spend an hour in Nairobi.",
          "My wife and I went to the sheldrick trust while in Nairobi and I decided to adopt an elephant (Larro) for her birthday. If you adopt an elephant ahead of time, you actually get to go at 5 p.m. instead of noon and have a much more private experience with the young elephants",
          "Heart touching education and culture. This elephant orphanage should be visited by every visitor to Nairobi for some good moments and education.",
          "nice place, good to know that they helping baby elefants to go back to nature. the explanations are a little bit long and boring after some time.",
          "This is my favorite place in Nairobi - no matter how busy I am I will always go the extra mile to see these amazing animals and their caretakers who go beyond call of duty to look after the orphans.",
          "It\u2019s worth to go there, just t see the elephant babies and get the information about the elephants and the orphanage. Come min. 1/2 hour earlier, normally is quite crowded. If it\u2019s raining, be prepared to stand in deep mud.",
          "This is a must do in Nairobi where you get up close and personal with the baby elephants and see how they interact. Start lining up early like 10:15 or 10:30 if you want to get a good spot. They only open at 11am daily for 1-2 hours. you get to possibly touch an elephant if you",
          "We loved seeing the baby elephants! We visiting during the special visiting time in the evening and the baby elephant stampede was the highlight of our visit! Seeing the elephants feeding in their bedrooms was great as well! We would recommend a visit here!",

          "This place is amazing and its real value for money. Try to visit the place with family and children and they will call it home away from home wonderful",
          "It's so humbling to learn about the amazing work this charity do. The baby elephants are so cute and funny. Would definitely recommend a visit, we went on a Saturday which is apparently the busiest day but that didn't affect our experience.",
          "An excellent job of protection of the elephant by rescuing the baby elephant and later on releasing them to the wild a great place to learn and know more about elephants.",
          "Take a detour and have a day to remember. It is personal and humane. You never know what you might adopt.",
          "These baby elephants bring a smile and a tear to your eye at the same time - about losing a mom but getting great care now and a future chance to return to the wild. Can\u2019t help feeling happier after seeing them. Opportunity to adopt one for $50 US to see how their life",
          "This is an amazing experience. The Sheldrick Trust raises orphaned elephants until they can go back to the wild. I foster 3 babies so was able to visit them in the evening when they come back from the bush with their keepers. I highly recommend visiting the Sheldrick elephant",
          "The reviews are all true! I adopted an elephant (Musiara) a few years ago with the goal of making it here for my 50th birthday. We had a whole day planned around the Karen area and this was Number 1 for me. We went for the 11AM visit - it was so great to see all the young",
          "This was our 3rd visit to the elephant centre, and it is just as interesting as it was the first time! Our first adopted elephant has grown and is now in Tsavo, so this time we adopted a new one, whom we hope to follow during our next visits to Kenya",
          "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust seems to have the most successful orphan elephant rescue and rehabilitation program in the world; they take care of orphaned elephants (many become orphaned due to human interactions; so sadly we are seeing the aftermath of our own doing!). The baby",
          "This venue was included in our itinerary prior to a Kenyan Safari. Get there a good half an hour before opening to get a good spot to watch the young elephants feeding. An excellent commentary by one of the elephant keepers with lots of information about elephants and their",
          "A must do when visiting Nairobi To meet these baby elephants and hear their stories was not only wonderful but educating The work that is carried out by the trust is inspirational especially how they are eventually reintroduced to the wild with new herds",
          "What these people do is simply amazing. These poor orphans who are supported until they are able to get back to a protected area is loving work. It is amazing to learn about these elephants. Touch them. See them. Talk to their keepers. And to support them is just a few dollars",
          "I know this place for the past 25 years so my memories from the past were better. The Sheldricks ladies did a fantastic job over these years taking care of the orphans. Sadly, it became a very commercial place, with hundreds of obnoxious tourists. However, still worth to",
          "We visited our 3 baby elephants and one rhino, Dololo, Kiasa, Musiara and Maxwell. It was lovely seeing them race into the compound to their respective keepers for the bedtime milk. Maxwell, the rhino is blind so was in his compound already. We had an hour with our little",

          "Great informative place and awesome for kids. Enjoyed the information but it's a very crowded place with not the best views unless you get lucky and beat the crowd to the fence. Also very expensive gift shop",
          "Everybody that comes or lives in Kenya should atleast make a point of visiting this amazing sanctuary. And adopt an elephant while at it at a very affordable fee annually. These proceeds go into buying Milk and medication for the baby elephants as well as sustaining the",
          "We visited the morning session which is open to anyone and the evening session which is for people who have adopted a baby elephant. The morning one was very busy and muddy as it was raining. The evening session was more personal. It was in a different area to the morning",
          "The baby elephants are super cute ! It\u2019s a great way to see the way they eat, drink and bath. However, it would have been better if we got to interact with the elephants.",
          "I went as part of a tour and this is an excellent way to donate. The price was 500 shilling or $7USD ( obviously cheaper in Shilling). They are only open 11-12 and the reality is it is a show made to get yo to donate. Everyone lines up before 11 and then as a group are let",

          "First visit following seeing documentaries on TV. Fell in love with the Trust's work, even adopted an baby elephant!",
          "Worth the \"adoption fee\" to get in after hours for an up close look at the elephants. If you go, hang back a bit when you go to see the babies come in from the park--- you will get a better photo as they approach you.",
          "We already adopted an elephant orphan before we flew to Nairobi. We liked the idea of the project and decided by adopting an elephant to Support it. As adopting parents we booked us in for the 5pm Session and were excited to See our little one. The elephants were so cute. And",
          "Don't miss a visit to the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust if you love elephants... it is very well run and you will never get any closer to juvenile elephants, unfortunately orphaned because of poaching and abandonment. You can also \"adopt\" one of them for a small fee and return later",

          "The elephant trust Is only open for an hour each day so the number of tourists crowded into a relatively small viewing area can be a bit overwhelming. We visited as part of our tour and I'm glad we made it here. The handlers bring out about 2 baby elephants at a time in a fenced",
          "The shelter allows the public in from 11.00 am to 12.00 am for non-Trust members. Very reasonable price for non-residents. Excellent viewing point and sometimes you can touch some younger bolder elephants - but usual caveats - they are gentle but still wild animals! Watch out",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Nairobi. I will warn you the 11-12 touristy showing can be quite overwhelming and gobs of people, but it is worth going at least once. What I highly recommend is adopting an elephant for $50 for the year and book the bed down experience. Way",
          "Want to see baby orphan elephants in Nairobi. Then this is the place. It\u2019s allowed for Visitors only for an Hr. 11 AM - 12 PM. So make sure you reached before 11 AM, because the space is limited & you won\u2019t get a better view of elephants if you are late.",
          "Visited with my sister and found the place such a dedicated organisation supporting orphaned and injured baby elephants. We've both adopted an elephant after seeing the great work of the centre.",

          "Cannot tell you what a wonderful place this is to visit and see the wonderful way the people there are taking care of these orphan baby elephants! They have an adoption program that a person can give them $50 and they will send you monthly info on the Elephant you want to adopt.",

          "If you want to enjoy how baby elephants are fed by baby formula, I am sure their cuteness will put a smile on your face.",
          "This project is fantastic and needed. The elephants are charming and in need of care! The only downside is the logistics of adopting one; they could have had a LOT more participants if they'd been set up to handle visitors a little better. This didn't change the experience;",
          "My second time here and the teens loved the babies. I noted quite an an addition to the stock. Did adopt one elephant, would love to see her grow up and return to the wild. A good reason for me to visit again and again.",

          "I adopted 4 babies, and consider this a very important and worth while endeavor and will continue to support them. The DSWT rely on donations to care for these adorable little guys. The facility is well run with incredibly dedicated and caring staff. The work they do is very",
          "Having each adopted babies from home, we were able to come back in the evening to see them on a more personal level as they were getting ready to sleep. The caretakers are amazing and truly care for their charges. The trust is a place anyone should consider donating to.",
          "Amazing experience seeing the Elephants. We were lucky to get close to the ropes and saw some cheeky baby elephants. The elephants come running down the hill to get fed (large bottles of milk). They play about in the mud and provide a lot of entertainment. There is a talk which",
          "I have, and so have my kids. I LOVE going there with my family. I can never get enough of the baby elephants. Although the interaction with humans is short, 1 hour, it's worth it. The narrative about the circumstances that the brought the babies to the foundation always makes",
          "Superb Place. David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is doing a Great Job by supporting Orphan Elephant Babies. We found the Elephants playful and seeing them drinking Milk in Big Bottles. This place is very next to Nairobi National Park. The best time to visit is to make sure you",
          "Well worth a visit. We saw 13 baby elephants in two groups and were told their life stories and how they came to be at the elephant orphanage. Rather too many seem to get stuck down wells - perhaps an new well design is needed in the areas the elephants most often get trapped.",
          "Make sure you look at the material on the website in detail before you go, so you understand what this will be like. Many of the negative reviewers obviously didn't do their research. This is not a petting zoo, you don't get the opportunity to truly interact with the animals.",
          "Fabulous insight into the incredible work they do to help orphaned elephants. Well worth a visit. Be aware you can only visit between 11.00 and 12.00",
          "It\u2019s cute and nice being if you are going Safari skip it as you will see plenty in the Mara. It\u2019s best doing before safari rather than after as it will feel like an anticlimax. Only open hour a day so get ur timings right",
          "Best experience of my life. We got to do the private viewing at 5pm and got to hang out with the baby elephants one on one. Its an incredible thing they do for these elephants and so happy it exists.",
          "We visited the baby elephants along with 100\u2019s of others for the one hour opening of between 11-12. Was surprised by the long line when we arrived 1/2 before but the line moved quickly when the gates opened. The \u201cshow\u201d was just lovely. Baby elephants ran down from the nearby",
          "What a wonderful elephant orphanage,also home to an 11 year old blind rhino!!Hearing the narrator talk about each elephant's history and seeing them romp and play was a memorable experience.What a joy!!!!!!",
          "What a wonderful experience! We learned so much about the organization and each baby elephant. You must visit if you are going to Nairobi.",
          "We had a wonderful time at the Orphanage. The elephants were too cute and we were very impressed with the staff. I felt the carers are doing a great job balancing allowing the public to watch and learn about the elephants while also not exploiting the animals. When someone in",
          "My Husband and I stopped here before our long flight home back to the States and I must say it was a wonderful way to end our trip. They teach you about each elephant and its wonderful to know there are people out there to take care of these babies.Such a wonderful cause !",
          "As a foster parent to some of the orphans in care DSWT was naturally my first stop when I arrived in Nairobi. The public visit was a little overcrowded with tourists but if you arrive early enough you won\u2019t get stuck at the back of the line and will secure a good spot to watch",
          "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been saving orphaned elephants for decades. These dedicated, selfless people are saving those special animals, one life at a time. This is certainly a place to visit if you want to encounter elephants and even more, a place to support in their",
          "It was so wonderful to be up close and personal with these sweet babies. It was great to hear about this project. They care for these babies until they can be on their own and then release them to their natural habitat. Fantastic project",

          "This is well worth a trip if you have a morning in Nairobi. Everyone loves seeing baby elephants! It's only open from 11am to 12, but you'll want to be in the queue by 10.30am to guarantee a good spot. My advice is to go to the Giraffe Centre at 9am (1 hour is enough there) and",
          "The babies are so cute. You stand along a path as the run by to get to their pins for the night. Their keepers go with them to feed them milk and fresh greens. Some of the babies let you pet them, but not all. One really young one was down and asleep in minutes. It really is",
          "I have been an adopter for many years so a visit to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust area was on the top of my list. From the parking lot, there is a short walk to an area where one of the keepers gives an informative talk on their work. Elephants, in the morning, are",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful place and a really good experience. Being able to see baby elephants and older elephants so close is a true privilege. It\u2019s also nice how the mc explains the whole story behind each elephant.",
          "We booked a private driver to take us to the Orphanage and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was a great introduction to conservation efforts in Kenya and a chance to get up close and if lucky personal with these young elephants. Take some water and wear a hat if the sun is",
          "You have to be here at 11am for the 1 hour show of the baby elephants feeding. It\u2019s only on once per day. They are very cute and you get to pat them if they come close. The foundation does wonderful work in saving these beautiful animals.",
          "An exceptional place to visit, to see just how great the David Sheldrick team are. They take abandoned baby Elephants, attend to their health, and eventually return them to the wild. To get this close and personal to young elephants is a very special experience.",
          "We (my parents and I) went to the elephant orphanage for the hour-long elephant feeding visit. It was undeniably fun to see the elephants playing and draining their milk bottles in less than 20 seconds. For $5 each (plus a cheap Bolt or Uber ride) it was worth it. Just don't",
          "This wildlife orphanage it wonderful. We watched the babies come out to play and be fed from giant bottles. There was no performance, thank goodness, but there was an educational talk about their work. At the end of the presentation, one could support their special work by",
          "Make sure you donate before you go and then arrive at 5 to see your elephant up close being fed! It\u2019s truly a once in a lifetime experience to be here watching the elephants being cared for. Many return to the wild in 3 years!",

          "These baby elephants are fortunate enough to have been found and looked after by this trust. They only open for one hour from 11-12 and it is worth getting there early so that you get to touch and see the baby elies.",
          "This place is amazing. They have spent years saving so many animals, not just elephants. They fly over areas looking for animals hurt by poachers, farmers etc. they give medical care on the spot. If they spot a young animal without a family, they bring them back to their",
          "A very overcrowded place. I could hardly see the hour-long feeding program. It is for a wonderful cause.",
          "This place is definitely well worth a visit. The small entrance fee of 500 Kenyan Shillings per person goes towards the care of the orphaned elephants as well as funds from shop sales of souvenirs. There is also a chance to sponsor an orphan to maintain the trust's project.",
          "They are doing great work but it\u2019s still captivity. Donate to the cause but go on safari. Elephants in the wild are so prevalent there is no need to go other than to support them in their cause to save orphans",
          "Specializing in baby elephant reintroduction and care back into the wild. Such a caring and proactive facility and doing a huge amount of good to save our African Elephants.",
          "Having read Daphne Sheldrick's book - Love, Life and Elephants, we knew a little about their Wildlife Trust and adopted rescued elephants prior to arriving. This allowed us to see the elephants during the hour set aside for the general public - but also to return later in the",
          "The people at the orphanages are doing a great work for the animals and very poor job for the visitors only the people at the first line see the animals everybody else cant they need to do either elevated platforms so all people can see or distrubte the elephants on seveal areas",

          "I visit Sheldrick Orphanage every time I am in Nairobi and I highly recommend a visit to this facility not only for the personal interaction it provides, but also for the opportunity one has to become a part of saving lives directly through conservation adoption. You can",
          "I had adopted 2 baby elephants before my trip to Nairobi. We went to the public viewing and then back again for the private viewing for those who adopted. It was awesome. The keepers are so loving and gentle with these baby orphans. It was heart warming to see & experience.",
          "We arrived at 10.15am and many people were gathering at the same time. Arriving early helps to gain a place at the rope so you're closer to the 14 baby elephants. Brilliant to see these animals so close and well looked after. Would highly recommend",
          "There are no words to describe it! Went twice, once for the foster parent visit and once for the morning public visit. They do incredible work!!",

          "This was an an amazing experience to watch 14 baby elephants up close for an hour. We got to watch them each have their bottle of milk and then play around together. If they came close enough we were able to stroke them and got some amazing pictures. I would advise arriving",
          "Heartwarming view of all the baby elephants who were rescued in the wild by this wildlife trust. Great presentation of the care of feeding of the babies, rehabilitation and ultimate release back into the wild.",
          "There is more to hear than to do or see. The bottom line is that the Trust is about salvaging deserted or injured baby elephants. You see them fed with big bottles of formula milk and hear more than you can do or see. If you have never been close to an elephant then it might",
          "A deal at just $5 (500 KSch), you will see between 15-30 baby elephants. They have been rescued from wells, poachers, and other tragedies. It is a great cause, informative, and fairly priced!",
          "We adopted two animals in advance and then were permitted a \u201cfoster parent\u201d visit in the late afternoon along with about 20 or 30 other folks. The grounds were immaculate and the men who care for the orphans are amazing, gentle souls. The baby elephants are obviously adorable",
          "you can only visit for 1 hour. People gather in line to get their place before the doors open. If you can hurry to the roped area and secure your place . People don't move once the elephants come out. The handlers do their best to give everyone along the ropes a chance to see",
          "The orphanage currently has 15 elephant orphans and they are the most adorable creatures. The centre is open at 11AM for public visits and if you are a foster parent of an orphan, you can book for your visit at 5PM (book early especially in July and August). You can see the",
          "If you love elephants and you want to have the chance to pet one and help to protect them this is the place to go. This place takes care of orphan elephants and the income allows them to provide all the necessary for their care. Amazing place to visit with kids.",
          "best done by adopting an elephant on their site and get the private 5 o'clock feeding invite. Very mindful and sanctuary places as all visitors really get this amazing nursery and treat it as such.",
          "Our family of 7 visited the Sheldrick elephant orphanage in July, 2019. The experience was informative and educational, but quite hot and crowded. If one could get close to the fence, it was possible to feed and stroke the baby elephants as they wandered past the crowd. The",
          "The place really is only open to visitors for an hour, but that is what's best for the animals. Apparently, you can buy into their special \"foster parent/adoption\" program and come during other times and see into their exclusive rehabilitation facility as well. Just about the",
          "Wish it had been more organized. Way too many people with limited viewing they should have two showings with limited numbers. It was chaos. I wish I could have really gotten close enough to see and touch the elephants better.",
          "we so learned so much here and enjoyed feeding the giraffes! what a great place to support. the work they are doing is amazing. our presenter was so knowledgeable and easy to listen to!",
          "This is a not-to-miss site if you are in Nairobi! They do such important work saving orphaned elephants ( and sometimes other animals), and returning them to the wild. Visitors may attend a daily presentation that showcases the baby elephants and the keepers explain the care",
          "Baby elephant orphanage started by David Sheldrick. Adorable baby elephants fed and taken care of here. Go before 11 am to see them being fed from large bottles.",
          "Fully enjoyed this park & presentation of the elephants and the work they do to bring them back to nature. Great to see them so up close, we were even able to touch them.",
          "The tip here is to stay to the end. The vast crowd thins out as the disinterested leave so you can get a decent view of these baby elephants. The work done by these keepers is magnificent to bring these wonderful animals to a place where they can go home to the reserves.",
          "Superb family fun to watch baby elephants play in the mud and dirt. The show runs from 11-12 each day, but you best arrive by 1030 to get ahead of the line...avoid going on weekends too as it will just be too crowded.",
          "The elephants are adorable, no doubt, but you must arrive very early to even see them properly. The orphanage only opens for one hour per day, which is rather commendable, so there is only one viewing. We could hardly see anything and our children quickly got bored (they were up",
          "Great place to stop while in Nairobi. It's a lot of fun, and the trainers are super knowledgeable. I recommend.",
          "We went to see the baby elephant feeding and there was quite a crowd. It was great to learn about the history of each elephant and the conservation efforts in place to ensure they\u2019re placed back in the wild. Super impressed.",
          "I adopted little Larro a few months before traveling to Kenya. I HAD to see her before leaving for home. We arranged a visit for fosters and it was fantastic. First, we see her and the other orphans running like wildfire for their dinner bottles, lol. Then we get to spent time",
          "Make sure that you include enough time in Nairobi to experience Sheldrick! An absolutely wonderful way to see these beautiful creatures up close and personal. Its well worthwhile adopting in advance and booking into the afternoon 5pm session prior to your trip.",
          "It is not everyday that you see elephants so close that you actually touch them. And not only can you stay close to them for about an hour but you know that the fee for the entrance goes to protect those orphans who lost their mother to poachers or other reasons. We learned more",
          "Definitely would recommend! Elephants are so cute and the staff explained their stories and the story of the center. You may get a chance to pet an elephant. They also seem very well treated. Entrance for tourist is 5 dollars or 500 shillings, which is perfectly fine and you are",
          "We recently visited this place on our Kenya Safari and we would recommend it as the work these guys are doing at David Sheldrick is commendable. Also a great place to take the kids as they will love interacting with the animals."

          "The Utamaduni Craft Centre was an unusual find. It\u2019s part playground, part shop, part aviary and part restaurant. The food is not too bad (once the order arrives correctly) and the menu quite varied. Worth visiting if you\u2019re passing, but not by any means a destination",
          "We nearly didn\u2019t go, our guide squeezed it in with our other stop offs. So glad we did! Masai blankets, beaded baskets, jewellery, wooden pots. A one stop shop!",

          "The Craft Centre is located close to the Karen Blixen house, the Giraffe Centre and other attractions in Nairobi. We stopped for lunch and shopping. We placed our food order, went into the shops, and were called when lunch was ready. The food was delicious. The diversity,",
          "Even though this is mainly an arts and crafts center, it also has a decent restaurant. What's more, the staff at the restaurant go out of their way to make you comfortable. We were provided good vegetarian options even when we landed there at lunchtime without a prior",

          "It was fun wandering through this craft centre, which, I'm guessing, was once a very large two-story house, but now is filled in every possible room, nook, cranny and hallway with hand-carved wooden sculptures, bowls, trays, serving utensils, paintings, books, clothing, coffee,",
          "There is this place just off Langata Rd, frequented by few and yet holding much. I was looking for African crafts that go beyond the local bazaars spreadout in the city and accidentally fell into Utamaduni. Thirsty and hungry, I wasn't expecting it. As I drove in I had purpose,",
          "I came to visit yesterday at around 3;36p m and we were denied entry by the askaris at the gate. Surely why do they underestimate Kenyans, they behaved like fools who wanted to be bribed & I feel they really need to be trained on customer care. They claimed that being that",

      "name": "City Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife.\nDespite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew\u2014it had 14,000 residents by 1910\u2014conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe park covers an area of 117.21 km2 (45.26 sq mi) and is small in comparison to most of Africa's national parks. The park's altitude ranges between 1,533 and 1,760 m (5,030 and 5,774 ft). It has a dry climate. The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem. The park has a diverse range of habitats and species.The park is located about 7 km (4.3 mi) from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe park's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include African buffalo, baboon, eastern black rhinoceros, gazelle, Grant's zebra, cheetah, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotamus, African leopard, lion, common eland, impala, Masai giraffe, ostrich, vultures and waterbuck.Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.\n\nThe David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means \"Rhinoceros Sanctuary\". It is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nMervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.\n\n\n== Tourism and education ==\nNairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week.The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrett, Michael; Christine Riley (1995).

        "wiki": "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates an orphan elephant rescue and wildlife rehabilitation program in Kenya. It was founded in 1977 by Dame Daphne Sheldrick to honor her late husband, David Sheldrick. Since 2001, it has been run by their daughter, Angela Sheldrick. \n\n\n== Mission ==\n\u201cThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust embraces all measures that complement the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife. These include anti-poaching, safe guarding the natural environment, enhancing community awareness, addressing animal welfare issues, providing veterinary assistance to animals in need, rescuing and hand rearing elephant and rhino orphans, along with other species that can ultimately enjoy a quality of life in wild terms when grown.\u201dThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust works closely with the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Kenya Forest Service and local communities to achieve their long term goal to secure safe havens for wildlife, through the effective management and protection of key ecosystems and wilderness areas in Kenya.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor over 25 years Kenya-born Daphne Sheldrick lived and worked alongside her husband, David Sheldrick, MBE, a naturalist and founding Warden of Tsavo East National Park. Throughout this time, they raised and successfully rehabilitated many wild animal species. Daphne Sheldrick\u2019s involvement with wildlife also spanned a lifetime, and she was a recognized international authority on the rearing of wild creatures. She was the first person to have perfected the milk formula and necessary husbandry for infant milk-dependent elephants, discovering that coconut oil was the nearest substitute for the fat in elephant milk. . \nAfter the death of her husband in 1977, Daphne and her family lived and worked in the Nairobi National Park, continuing David's legacy of conservation. In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial Appeal, a part of the African Wildlife Project, metamorphosed into the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust; becoming an independent non-profit organization.The organization re-branded their name and logo on February 1, 2019, changing their name from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust to the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in order to honor both David and Daphne Sheldrick.The number one long-term achievement of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is their success with raising orphaned baby elephants and integrating them back in the wild. The Trust is a leader in conservation efforts to help save the remaining African elephant populations in grave danger from the illegal ivory trade. \n\n\n== Foster program ==\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates a digital foster program which allows individuals across the world to support their field projects by fostering an orphaned elephant, rhino or giraffe in their care for themselves or as a gift. For a suggested donation of $50 per orphan per year, individuals receive via email: a personalised certificate, an interactive map, monthly update on the progress of their orphan and a watercolour by CEO Angela Sheldrick.All elephant, rhino and giraffe orphans rescued by the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust are available to foster, including those orphans living back in the wild, and proceeds benefit the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s conservation projects.\n\n\n== Visiting ==\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s Elephant Orphanage is located in Nairobi National Park, Kenya and is open to the public for one hour every day, excluding 25 December, from 11 am to noon. During this time the orphans arrive for their midday mud bath and feeding.  Entrance to the orphanage for the visiting hour requires minimum contribution of $7 US dollars / 500 Kenya shillings per person. A gift shop is on site and visitors can also set up a fostering during their visit.\n\n\n== Conservation projects ==\n\n\n=== Orphans project ===\nOn call every day of the year, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust travels throughout Kenya to rescue orphaned elephants and rhinos left alone with no hope of survival. Many of the orphans rescued are victims of poaching and human-wildlife conflict and are in a terrible state of emaciation and distress.After each orphan rescue, the long and complex process of rehabilitation begins at the DSWT\u2019s Nursery nestled within the Nairobi National Park. For milk-dependent elephant calves it is here, during this crucial phase, where they are cared for and healed both emotionally and physically by the DSWT\u2019s dedicated team of elephant Keepers who take on the role and responsibility of becoming each orphan\u2019s adopted family during their rehabilitation.Each elephant remains at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s Nursery in Nairobi National Park until they are ready to make the journey to one of three rehabilitation stockades at Voi or Ithumba in Tsavo East National Park , or at their Umani Springs Reintegration Unit. This second phase of rehabilitation can span a period of up to ten years as the orphaned elephants gradually transition back into the wild herds of Tsavo, taken at a pace determined by each individual elephant.\nTo date, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has successfully hand-raised over 200 infant elephants and reintegrated over 100 orphaned elephants back into the wild herds of Tsavo National Park. More than 25 wild born calves have been born to orphaned elephants raised in their care, living back in the wild.\n\n\n=== Anti-poaching teams ===\nTo combat ivory, bushmeat and rhino horn poaching, which are devastating wildlife populations, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates fully equipped Anti-Poaching Units in partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). By March 2017, the DSWT/KWS Units had made more than 2,800 arrests and removed in excess of 140,000 snares.\nTen Units protect the greater Tsavo Conservation Area covering a vast 60,000km2, whilst one fully mobile unit is operating throughout the country where it is needed the most. These fully trained frontline teams, accompanied by armed KWS Rangers, are equipped with vehicles, camping equipment, radios, GPS units and cameras, patrolling daily to combat elephant and rhino poaching as well as the threat of bushmeat snaring.Supporting these vital ground teams is a Rapid Response Anti-Poaching Unit operated by armed KWS rangers selected from the Service\u2019s top field recruits.\n\n\n=== Canine Unit ===\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates a specialist Canine Unit with three Belgian Malinois who have been trained to track and detect illegal wildlife products such as ivory, rhino horn and bush meat as well as guns and ammunition. The three canines are deployed to support the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s anti-poaching efforts and are accompanied by six fully trained handlers.\n\n\n=== Aerial surveillance ===\nSupporting the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust\u2019s ground efforts is an Aerial Unit, which includes six aircraft and a helicopter, all of which are active in the field throughout the Tsavo ecosystem as well as within the Lamu District. Daily, the Aerial Unit takes part in security patrols and provides support to search and veterinary intervention for injured elephants and wildlife, as well as search and rescue operations for orphaned elephant calves and wildlife emergencies.Aerial reconnaissance is a vital tool in the effective prevention of illegal activities and the DSWT\u2019s combination of active ground teams and an \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 have resulted in many successes in preventing poaching attacks, apprehending poaching offenders and recovering tusks, whilst saving the lives of many injured elephants and other wildlife species due to poaching incidents.\n\n\n=== Mobile Veterinary Units ===\nThe Sheldrick Wildlife Trust operates four fully equipped Mobile Veterinary Units and a Sky Vet initiative headed by Kenya Wildlife Service Vets to alleviate the suffering of injured wild animals. All four units are equipped with custom-made vehicles, darting hatches, equipment shelves, a fridge, an operating table and necessary medicines and equipment required for rapid and effective veterinary response to any cases.\nThe Tsavo Mobile Veterinary Unit based at the KWS Voi Headquarters, covers an extensive area including the greater Tsavo Conservation Area as well as the Chyulu Hills National Park and the Shimba Hills National Reserve.The Mara Mobile Veterinary Unit covers the Masai Mara National Reserve, the adjacent Mara Triangle, neighbouring community areas, as well as the Lake Naivasha and Nakuru areas within the Rift Valley; when needed the unit also operates as far West as Ruma National Park and Lake Victoria.The Meru Mobile Veterinary Unit operates out of Meru National Park and provides permanent veterinary support to the larger Meru ecosystem consisting of Meru National Park, Bisanadi National Park and Kora National Reserve, including all wildlife dispersal areas around the Eastern Conservation Area, whilst also extending its services into additional parks and reserves in the Northern Conservation Area.The Amboseli Mobile Veterinary Unit operates out of Amboseli National Park and services the Southern Conservation Area encompassing Kajiado, Namanga, Magadi, Lake Natron as well as the Southern Tsavo West area including Lake Jipe, an ecosystem famous for large number of elephants.The Sky Vet initiative funds and coordinates the deployment of KWS vets to emergency wildlife cases throughout Kenya by air and is a vital addition to the DSWT\u2019s veterinary program. Between Sky Vets and the four units over 1,500 wild elephants have been assisted and the lives of countless other species have been saved.\n\n\n=== Fencing ===\nWith agriculture and human settlement encroaching into wildlife habitats, disrupting migratory routes and protected boundaries, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been erecting and maintaining hundreds of kilometres of fencelines to limit this growing conflict over natural resources.\n\n\n=== Water provision for wildlife ===\nWith limited rainfall in the arid Tsavo Conservation Area, which in recent years has shown a drastic decline, arid areas such as Tsavo and Lamu are first to suffer from prolonged drought. To address this threat to the wildlife within these habitats, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has built 14 boreholes and windmills to enhance the dry season productivity, as well as instigating temporary water-relief programs to relieve suffering.\n\n\n=== Saving habitats ===\nBy securing Public-Private Partnerships with the Kenya Forest Service and Community Group Ranches, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is safeguarding unique and endangered wild habitats.\n\n\n==== Tsavo Conservation Area ====\nThe Trust owns 4,000 acres of land adjoining the Tsavo East National Park. This land, known as the Peregrine Conservation Area, is prime wildlife habitat and also serves as the DSWT field headquarters, providing support for all of the Trust\u2019s Tsavo-based projects.\n\n\n==== Kibwezi Forest ====\nIn partnership with the Kenya Forest Service, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has embarked on conserving and sustaining the environment in the Kibwezi Forest.\nThe Kibwezi Forest, one of Kenya\u2019s last remaining groundwater woodlands, is a unique ecosystem bordering the Chyulu Hills National Park and an exceptional biodiversity hotspot providing a habitat for a number of wildlife species, including the African elephant as well as an impressive collection of rare and endemic mammals, birds, reptiles, butterflies, invertebrates and fish.Conservation and protection programs in the area include natural resource management, anti-poaching patrols as well as the construction and maintenance of electrically fenced boundaries, ensuring the steady rehabilitation of the area whilst safeguarding the local communities and their livelihoods from wildlife damage. Other conservation activities taking place within the Kibwezi Forest include the monitoring of water extraction, fire control, invasive species control and key habitat and endangered species management, whilst providing benefits to the local communities through sustainable resource utilisation, education and tourism.\n\n\n=== Community outreach ===\nFor more than 15 years, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has operated a community outreach project, working to improve the livelihoods and educational standards of people living along the borders of Kenya\u2019s National Parks and protected areas through the introduction of community initiatives and local employment.Their initiatives include:\n-         Free field trips throughout the year into Tsavo East and West National Parks for schools living on the Parks borders.\n-         Tree Planting Programs. The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has developed three mature tree nurseries, producing thousands of saplings, which are distributed to local communities and schools, encouraging families and children to plant, nurture and protect their trees and forested areas to instil a better understanding of the value of their natural resources.\n-         Wildlife Film showings to local communities.-         Beehive fence lines. Since 2015, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been working with local communities inhabiting the north-western border of Tsavo East, to erect a 2.6 km long elephant-beehive fence with 131 beehives on seven forefront farms bordering the park.-         Funding of local radio programs in a variety of local languages, which promote wildlife education and feature DSWT field members speaking about their work and experiences.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPinnawala Elephant Orphanage, established in 1975 by the Sri Lanka Department of Wildlife Conservation\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBBC, Elephant Diaries: BBC - Science & Nature - Elephant Diaries\nBuchanan, Gordon (2016), Elephant Family And Me.

          "Amazing visit! yes it is crowded, yes it is hot in the sun, but we managed to get a front row spot under a tiny bit of shade and made the experience much better. The elephants get close and we even managed to pat one of the babies who came right up to the rope They came out in",
          "We learned so much about the plight of baby elephants because of poaching, droughts ...the babies were adorable, came so close to the visitors that we could touch them. Fantastic experience and highly recommended...",
          "This non-profit organization is so heartwarming, educational and fun. My grown children loved it and were completed captivated by the sweet baby elephants. A worthy cause!",
          "This was a great experience that was both educational and enjoyable. We learned a lot about the dangers facing elephants in the wild and about how this trust rescues elephants and later reintroduces them to their natural habitats. It is located on the outskirts of Nairobi and is",
          "We always take visitors to see the baby elephants here. Good value for money and such a worthy cause. Only an hour, which is easily doable.",
          "I sponsored a couple of the baby elephants before going to Kenya and I was very happy to see them in real life at this sanctuary. Nothing is more important than nature and it's life - elephant life is extra special",

          "Nothing could be more heartwarming than elefant babies having their bottles. They are sooo playful and sweet.",
          "Get there early to purchase your tickets, the queues can get quite long. It's a very popular tourist spot. Entrance fee is pretty reasonable as well. The staff do a great feeding show where the baby elephants are fed and actually walk around so you can touch them and maybe even",
          "So, if you plan to go to this place while you are on holiday in Kenya it is worth the time. It is only open for an hour a day and you get to see the elephants being fed. You will find a perfect view wherever you are situated when you enter the park and get the opportunity for",
          "On our recent trip with ESA Safaris we visited the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and we adopted an elephant. This is an incredible organization doing wonderful things for the orphaned animals. Please support by adopting these animals and aide in their care from afar.",
          "Fun experience seeing baby elephants rescued from the wild. They are re-released in 3-7 years. Very informative .",
          "Being up close and personal with the elephant calves was a lot of fun. Loved seeing the way they rush for their milk. It was like a cavalry charge.",
          "These are some of the best heroes in Kenya. I would highly recommend stopping by and supporting this beautiful refuge. They are bring back the elephants whose population was dwindling. Bravo to all of you!",
          "We had adopted an elephant so we got to go to the later visitors hour in the evening. It was great! We got to see them come rushing in from their day of exploring, then we could walk around and see them all in their enclosures. They are very well cared for and it was lovely to",
          "If you are in Nairobi and are free between 11am and 12pm you have to visit the Sheldrick to see the baby orphaned elephants. They are so cute and actually you get quite close (if you get there early enough you can stand VERY VERY close!) But what's most important is the good",
          "While it does seem odd that they walk the elephants out into a circle for the people to watch, it is nice to see them so close up. And seems they do good work helping the animals. The day we were there loads of school kids were on a field trip. Everyone enjoyed the",
          "This is almost free - $7 per person. Such an amazing experience and my boys were up close with these baby elephants. Please, if you go, respect the handlers who ask you to be quiet during the experience. The group I was with just couldn't manage that, despite being asked more",
          "David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust really is a place for #DoGoodHaveFun! Three 'levels' of interaction: 12 noon) Open to the public (we did not do) 3 PM) Open to those who have adopted and significant up-charge (not sure how much) but very exclusive and need significant advance time",
          "We had a lovely evening experience visiting the orphans after adopting one online. The babies are so playful and cute coming back home after a day in the park. It\u2019s a great learning experience to see the work the DSWT is doing and the passion it takes to get these babies back to",
          "Working in the animal welfare field, I was really interested to visit the trust and learn more about how they are protecting and saving elephants. The public is only allowed in for an hour and it is quite crowded, but so worth seeing the babies being bottle fed. The",
          "We adopted a baby elephant named Roho and went to visit the orphanage for their evening visit where we watched the orphans come in from the forest for the night and drink their evening milk. This place is amazing in what they do for the baby elephants. The also had a rhino",
          "Really loved spending 1h just visiting the elephants since I have been following their work for a while. It's the right thing to have those restrictions. If you have questions the keepers will answer them.",
          "Its a nice place to minimize a long day before your flight home.i will definitely recommend it to anyone willing to visit.",
          "This is a nice conservancy in nairobi for a free weekend to relax at. Feeding the baby elephants was a good experience . Good job to the animals.",
          "This place is one of those unique places that do an immensely wonderful job of wildlife conservation. The team here takes loving care of orphaned baby elephants until they are ready to be released back into the wild. Watching a piece of this action is once in a lifetime",

          "I was not only thrilled to meet the orphans that my family and I have adopted over the years but overwhelmed by the kindness and heartwarming presence of the Foundation caretakers and staff. The joy and feeling of a secure home for all of these orphans brings tears to ones eyes.",
          "Brilliant insight into what the Wildlife Centre does for orphaned and rescued elephants. Certainly brightens your day when you see the elephants rush out from the fields for their feed. A must visit",
          "Usually a visitor favorite! I have been many times, taking visitors. Go at least 15 minutes (or more) early as the line is long, and you will want a spot on the fence to be close to the elephants. Wear a hat, as you will be standing in the sun for an hour. Probably will stay a",
          "As lover of elephants, the visit at David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was really a beautiful and emotional experience. My partner and I adopted Roho, the little elephant who is just arrived at the center and we had the opportunity to meet him and stay together for 1 hour. Great",
          "We have pictures of our children walking with young elephants and rhinos when we were last here over 25 years ago. Things have changed in terms of visiting but it\u2019s still a lovely place to visit and support the good work they are doing. Consider an extra donation over and above",
          "The Sheldrick Elephant Sanctuary is a must see when in Nairobi. The public is only allowed to be with the elephants for one hour (11am-12pm local) while they get fed. What\u2019s really exciting is that you can see the elephants racing toward the feeding area...they know what\u2019s",

          "This is an amazing establishment. If possible, try and arrange a private visit in the afternoon. You can interact with the elephants after they\u2019ve been fed, and talk to the incredible people who work here and dedicate their life to these orphans.",
          "The Wildlife trust does a great work in both rehabilitation and information on the greatest animal of Africa. You are able to get close and hear the storries and watch them play in the mud.",
          "I almost burst into tears when I saw this little fellas playing all around! was incredible! It was raining that day so the floor was reaaaaally muddy and hard to walk, be prepared with a pair of boot or something ! It\u00b4s not the politest place, people there are kinda .... rude?",
          "After entering at 11am, visitors are ushered to a small viewing area centered on a muddy watering hole. After a short while later, the animal handlers come in alongside several baby elephants. For the first part of the viewing, the handlers bottle-feed the baby elephants -What a",
          "I visited the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and I was heartbroken to learn about how poachers harms these beautiful animals and how elephants never forget anything, so they will always remember the trauma they've been through. At the same time, it was heartwarming to learn how",
          "I sponsor an elephant at the nursery and have known about this charity for a number of years. These poor orphans are visibly affected by the loss of their mother and some of the awful injuries, but are now safe and extremely well cared for. It is such an emotional experience",
          "You can only see the baby elephants for an hour, but it was so totally worth the full hour. These little (big) guys are so adorable, you get a story of each of them and they are hilarious to watch and sometime even get to pet. They are kinda like giant dogs playing around. It",

          "It was amazing to see all the young elephants who have been rescued from the various national parks in Kenya. It is only open from 11-12 and you should plan to get their 30 minutes early to get in line because they can fill up quickly. But the elephants are incredible, they come",
          "Feeding time at the Sheldrick Wildlife Centre is lovely. A herd of little elephants trot down enthusiastically to be fed their bottles of milk by their keepers. The centre rescues young animals, mainly elephants but some others too, who have been orphaned by some means and",
          "it was lovely to see the baby elephants but too many people, so they should have it open for smaller groups for 30 min at time and shift the group tours in 4 different sessions. Very expensive in the shop. Loved the storyteller!",
          "We went to the Wildlife Trust in January 2020 & it was amazing. So wonderful to see the elephants especially the babies who got up to mischief & ran around enjoying every minute. It was so lovely watching them take their milk & trying to hold the bottle themselves. It had been",

          "I've been an avid follower and supporter of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, now known as the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, for several years. I've been a foster mom to different orphans and have wanted to visit for some time. Alas, I didn't make it before matriarch Daphne",
          "The one hour feeding with the baby elephants happens at 11 a.m, each day. That feeding is open to the public. It was a lovely experience and fun to watch the elephants finish their bottles and after graze on leaves. Each elephant had its own personality and name, and the",
          "If you adopt the elephants, then you can meet them up close in the late afternoon for an hour with other adopters. There are instructions on the website to contact them and make the arrangements. We got to touch them (the ones who let us anyway) and spent time going around",
          "Wow, where do I start. My friends and I have followed/supported the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust for quite a few years now and planned our trip to include numerous trips to the orphanage and their Voi Reintegration Unit. Our first visit was to the 11am public viewing. This was",
          "This was a wonderful place, met 17 orphaned elephants, a blind rhino and naughty giraffe. The people here who dedicate there time to these vulnerable orphans deserve every credit. It\u2019s a moving experience hearing their stories as all where brought in for their milk. We adopted",
          "We have visited on a number of occasions and never been disappointed. The 1100 feeding is a fun and informative experience, though can get very busy, but allows you to learn a lot about the elephant orphans and see them enjoy their lunchtime feed. Would rate that experience 4",
          "We started our East African Safari with a visit to the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. We were able to see the young elephants during feeding time and learned how they were kept and cared for until they were able to return to the wild. We were very happy to learn about this worthwhile",

          "David Sheldricks is a great place to learn more about Elephants. One gets to see them at a much closer range as opposed to driving through the park. The stories told about them by their keepers makes one want to connect with the environment in a very unique way. These elephants",
          "Was able to visit the trust on a tour in June of last year. What a wonderful place. Not only do you get to see the baby elephants feed, but you get time to watch them and get super close. These people are Angels! Taking care of these orphans is a cute and tough job and they",

          "I loved hearing about all the elephants - the speaker gave the story of each elephant we saw! You get to see them up close and it is a pleasure to watch them eat and play. After the show, the shop could be more organised as there was simply a table with a lot of people around,",
          "We visited here after being in safari and wanted to meet roho the orphaned baby elephant my daughter very kindly sponsored for me. We went with a guide as we were visiting the giraffe centre and National park on the same day. The guide showed us how to afford the bun fight to",
          "I visited David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, that is a non-profit trust, in January 2020. It was a fantastic and unforgettable experience At 11 am, the 17 orphan baby elephants come with their keeper around a muddy waterhole. Baby elephants are aged from 1-month to 3 years old.",

          "Been several times and it's always so good. The babies are so cute. It never gets old. The sun can get a little hot sometimes but there is some shade, though not much. If you can, go during the week, perhaps not during school holidays if at all avoidable as it can get busy. But",

          "This was added on to our tour last minute and I'm so glad that change was made! We learned a lot about the elephants while observing them playing and being fed. I was actually able to pet a baby elephant and his skin didn't feel like I thought it would. I'm not quite sure what I",
          "David Sheldrick Wildlife is interesting because you are getting a lot of information about elephant and how they treat them, you can ask as many questions as you want. The only thing is that there are too many people around the elephant and only one hour to see them",
          "We enjoyed the hour spent and thought the information given was interesting. Great experience for all ages, but most little kids will have trouble staying interested the entire hour. Was so glad to get there in person after following on Instagram",
          "We had the privilege of visiting the orphanage as adopters. It was fantastic to actually see and learn up close and personally the amazing work done here. I think my favorite part was walking around and observing the elephants as they settled into their routines. They each had",
          "Donate $50 to adopt a baby elephant and you get to visit your baby elephant (and all other baby elephants) at 5pm daily. It's for a good cause and absolutely worth it! I got to pet my baby elephant, a one year old (Roho) who was rescued after his mom was killed by poachers.",
          "I went to the DSWT as part of a 3-stop day trip from Nairobi. The site opens to the public only from 11 to 12, hence you need to plan accordingly. Once on the site, you are provided with explanations about each elephant, the orphanage and the mission which, to my opinion, is",
          "Love the elephant orphanage! It\u2019s a must see in Nairobi , they have a talk and explain everything they do for orphaned elephants and explain the name of each elephant and how they came to be there, they help them grow up socialise with wild elephants to help release them back",
          "It was so nice to visit the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust - they open at 11 for one hour while they feed the elephants. The elephants are only babies so they are extremely adorable and playful. If you stand close to the rope barriers you can sometimes touch them. The staff give",
          "I went to Sheldrick after adopting one of their baby elephants -- it was an amazing experience to see the elephants up close, learn about the work they are doing, and talk to the truly saintlike men who care for these special creatures. Each elephant has its own keeper; they",
          "The David Sheldrick elephant orphanage is a must see and a great way to start your visit to Kenya. The love and care that goes into taking care of the baby elephants is amazing. I had chills when the baby elephants came out. The visit is only an hour but it\u2019s enough to watch and",
          "In the 1940s, the husband and wife team of David and Daphne Sheldrick helped set up the Tsavo National Park. They were among the pioneers of wildlife conservation in Kenya, and the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was set up on the outskirts of Nairobi, abutting the countryside, to",

          "This place was pretty cool! Only $5 and worth it IMO. They have 2 groups of elephants that come out and you\u2019ll have the chance to pet the elephants if they come near you. My tip is to get there early and stand near one of the mud/water puddles. May get a little dirty, but it\u2019s",
          "Much has been said already, so here's what our experience was like at the adopter visit: For ~US$50 you can adopt an orphan for a year, and this qualifies you to have an adopter visit separate from the standard 11a feeding experience. It does need to be booked in advance, you",
          "Great to see orphan elephants being rescued, cared for, and released back into the wild. Feeding time is at around 11am, after which the show is over, but it\u2019s fun to watch the young elephants feed from the bottle.",
          "Visiting these gentle giants is one of my favourite things to do in Nairobi. The Trust is well organised with strict visiting hours (currently 1 hour every day from 11am for public and 1 hour every day - subject to advance booking from 5pm for visitors who have adopted the",

          "The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust does amazing work caring for orphaned baby elephants all the way until they are old enough to be returned to the wild. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the elephant sanctuary. It is clear that this is a true sanctuary and not a money making gimmick. We enjoyed seeing the elephants and hearing their stories.",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit to see and learn about baby elephants. And the money for your visit helps rescue and reintroduce elephants to the wild. A special place!",
          "Wonderful spot! We adopted an orphaned elephant and went to the 5 pm session. The parade of orphaned elephants was fantastic! Don\u2019t be late. Reservations required.",
          "Not only cause it\u2019s a great experience but also a great cause. Should be compulsory on all Kenya visits!!",
          "We visited whilst in Nairobi ( ironically immediately before starting a long safari) It\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or so. The staff are doing great work And the baby elephants are so so cute.",
          "I was completely overwhelmed with this amazing place. Despite the rain we had a lovely hour falling totally in love with all these gorgeous animals. This charity does the most phenominal work and it was very interesting hearing all the back stories of all the babies. Highlight",
          "A interesting experience for learning about elephants and the problems in the wild life; it\u2019s fun too",
          "What a special place! I had adopted an elephant and was able to go to the 5pm feeding and bedtime. It was nice because there was only about 25-30 of us. We were able to see the elephants run into the stockades (so adorable), as well as watch them eat, and speak to their",

          "We really loved the experience and the beautiful babies. Great job to the caregivers and the David Sheldrick foundation.",
          "It was a brief hour-long visit we drove to via Uber. The main focus of the center is not tourism, but animal rehabilitation. We received a solid description of the roles performed by the trust over PA while the elephants walked near the visitors. It was excellent to see",
          "Really nice to see the small elephants being taken care of in such a magnificent way. Well worth a visit when in Nairobi.",
          "It\u2019s actually okay. For real conservation education, much better to go to Ole Pajeta near Nanyuki. Took my preschool boys. They liked it the first time but weren\u2019t interested in going back after seeing real families in the Tsavo and the conservation projects at ole pajeta.",
          "Good place to go to understand how they are looking after the elephant orphans, and ensuring they get back into the wild. Yes a bit of a queue, but they do well to get you all in, and its managed so that it doesn't impact the elephants. Worth a trip if you are visiting the area.",
          "Quite informative and interesting attraction , but the management of the trust has failed to offer commensurate facilities to the visiting tourists either by default or lack of interest. The entrance to the orphanage is quite a haphazard affair due lack of planning. Instead of",
          "I have been a long time supporter of this organization, and will continue to be as long as I\u2019m standing and breathing! The work they have done, not only in rescuing elephant orphans, but many other animals, is just astonishing! Their commitment to helping stave off poachers",
          "What they are doing here is a wonderful thing, but not the best tourist experience with it being so many people in such a small space. If you get there at least an hour early, it would greatly enhance the experience, but otherwise I'd spend your time elsewhere.",
          "Elephant orphanage was very fun. Very crowded but our guide took us right to the front and knew where to stand to see the best and get to pet the elephants. Also fed giraffes and took us to an interesting out of the way restaurant. Great day.",
          "We adopted 2 baby elephants prior to our visit to Nairobi (we are big supporters of wildlife rescue groups--and were intrigued by the idea of meeting our \"babies\" in person!). After we adopted our babies--Maktao and Kiasa--I contacted Sheldrick to set up a visit with other",

          "Love, is the first feeling when you see the gentle giants in front of you. So large yet so playful. Just like human children, they are mischievous and playful too and they want your attention. The orphanage takes good care of these elephant calves and unlike others I have been",
          "An interesting and informative visit. Lots of opportunity to take photos. Make sure you arrive early to get a good viewing spot as it can get very busy",
          "Make this a part of your Nairobi to do list. When those babies come charging down the hill to get their bottles, it\u2019s hilarious! And the staff does a tremendous job telling you about the individual babies and how they ended up there. You get to be close enough to touch them; oh",
          "Viewing the elephant orphanage is a different experience from the Safaris and national parks. You get to hear the story of the orphaned elephants and it's quite moving. They are so cute as they play in the red mud. It really made me and my family feel more compassion for",

          "Visited here and saw the baby elephants that have been saved from a variety of unfortunate situations some natural, some man made. The 1 hour that it opens every day means inevitably it is very busy but the sight of the elephants was very special for my kids who have adopted one",

          "As a general rule, when on safari, I don't enjoy Zoo type environments as much as being out in the safari vehicles seeing the animals roaming free. This was definitely an exception. All the elephants here were orphaned and would have not have survived in the wild, but here,",

          "Had an opportunity to visit this place with my friend and got to know about elephants. They basically care for the baby elephants with no parents either after their parents were killed by poachers in hunt of tusks or what not. A very beautiful place with so much wildlife",
          "You def have to go visit the orphanage. It was such a wonderful, eye opening experience to see how they take care of the elephants!! All the effort and energy these people do to take care of them is inspiring!! If you can, adopt an elephant. The money will help them a lot to",
          "This place is so great!! They are doing amazing things and letting people enjoy the area while doing so. For 50 dollars you can adopt an elephant and take it home with you (well actually just a watercolor picture of it but still) This is a must. Just make sure you are there by",
          "What wonderful work this place and people do! The visit was very worth while, very educating and opening peoples eyes to the fight against ivory markets. So sad to know that all the little elephants were left orphaned because of mankind in some way. At the same time we were so",
          "We visited in the morning where we learnt a lot about the elephant orphans, and were also entertained by a warthog that sneaked in between the elephants. Since we a adopted a rhino, we were also able to make the afternoon visit which is a very different experience where you see",
          "Very interesting, the explanations are quite good and the baby elephants so 'cute'! Very nice experience. I recommend",
          "A must see if you are in Nairobi. Orphaned elephants are hand raised fr up to 4 years when they are relocated back into the bush. Wonderful experience.",

          "Enjoyed the company of cute baby elephants while at the same time contributing to their care. Highly recommend a visit!",
          "This was a fantastic experience. The Elephant orphanage is just fun to watch. The elephants run out to meet their care takers, who stay with them until they are release to the wild AND accepted into an elephant herd. They have special milk they feed the elephants. And, you",
          "The trip is only for an hour. Two groups of young elephants come into the ring, are fed, play around for a bit and then go out again. They are lovely and some great photo opportunities Very worthwhile work being done here.",
          "This was just about ok. If you have already seen elephants earlier there is nothing here...Just a few baby elephants who come up to drink milk..Of course the important message is the good stuff they are doing for abandoned elephants..Personally I did not find anything great",
          "To see these magnificent animals, orphaned for r natural or subversive reasons, being cared for until they can return to the wild warmed my heart. I observed the obvious dedication of the staff to their charges as they raise them to an age where they can be transferred to",
          "If you have the time this is a stop worth your time. This facility for years has been caring for and releasing orphaned elephants. An opportunity to get up close and personal with baby elephants. The staff are incredibly dedicated to the task of caring for these noble creatures.",
          "Interesting place, seeing the baby elephants and rhino up close was really fun. Note it\u2019s only open 1 hour each day.",
          "Thought this might be a nice was to spend a few hours in Nairobi, but boy was i wrong. Better go to a zoo in your home town than be herded like elephants (pun intended) to this second rate tourist spot. Maybe they are doing a nice thing, but it seems like a hustle for tourist",
          "I am very pleased we went to the sanctuary. The work being done in saving the baby elephants at risk is wonderful. Elephants are released to Tsavo Park once old enough to survive. The visit was very informative and enjoyable.",
          "Seeing the orphan baby elephants rushing to be fed was a lovely experience. Full marks to the centre for their work to raise and then release them",
          "The tireless,timelesa work and sacrifice being administered to the orphan elephants is beyond words can express,its so heart touching to see young elephant given a second chance to live courtesy of Sheldricks",
          "You need to get there well before feeding to secure a good vantage point. I found some late arrivals were very aggressive at pushing to the front and displacing early arrivals, hence my rating of good rather than excellent. Once the babies start coming down it is wonderful to",
          "Get there at least an hour before the feeding and don't trust later arrivals to politely sit behind early arrivals. You definitely want to be at the front of the herd for pics and perhaps a chance to pet one of the orphans.",
          "I have been wanting to visit this place since I first learned of it some years ago. I adopted a baby and met him and it was magical.",
          "Very moving to watch these baby orphans who have been traumatized (mothers killed, lost, sick) being cared for by keepers so they can be returned to the wild and live a natural life. While the keepers feed the elephants, an informative and educational presentation is given so",
          "The orator was very knowledgeable, provided very useful insight and encouraged questions from the audienct. Tip: arrive early so that you can get right next to the rope fence and you will likely be able to touch small elephants as they walk by",
          "This place is wonderful. I encourage everyone to watch the movie, Born to Be Wild as this video really encompasses what you will be seeing at the Sheldrick Wildlife center. Wonderful opportunity to see baby elephants, a giraffe, and a rhino. There are warthogs wondering around",
          "They do such important work here, and there is so much to learn about Kenyan wildlife, the needs of baby elephants, and what it takes to save the environment from further destruction. Highly recommended, and do yourself a favour, sponsor one or more of the elephants so you get",
          "This is a total reap off. They are just making money in the name of conservation. Very disappointing.",
          "What a fun morning we had at the orphanage! The baby elephants are such a delight, playing in the mud, teasing each other, trumpeting...I could watch them for hours! We also thought that we were given a lot of important information by the keeper who was doing the presentation",
          "Let me preface this review with the fact that I have read all of Dame Daphne Sheldrick\u2019s books and am a foster of several elephants here. Needless to say it was a dream come true for me to visit this orphanage and it did not disappoint. They bring the baby elephants out in two",
          "Wonderful experiance where you can see your dollar going into conservation, which is rare in Africa. Its usually directed who knows where. Great to see so many animals being cared for pproperly",
          "The Trust does incredible work saving orphaned elephants. They provide rehabilitation and reintroduction for many young elephants and they go to great lengths to save orphaned elephants and injured animals. We watched them feed the baby elephants with bottles and while this",
          "The elephants were so cute! There were 14 baby elephants at the site. We were able to touch the elephants.",
          "Learn about the work to keep the elephant population growing in Africa. The elephants are adorable, and the keepers who care for them should be highly commended.",
          "A worthwhile cause to help the Elephants has turned in to a big tourist attraction but not without problems. It was a pretty hot day, no shade and no where to sit. Standing 4 deep around the enclosure was useless as far a seeing anything. Disappointingly an uncomfortable waste",
          "Having been a supporter of Sheldrick Wildlife Trust for a decade, I cannot speak highly enough of the organization. In addition to rescuing, rehabilitating and returning to the wild orphaned elephants, rhinos and giraffes, they also work with Kenya Wildlife Service to remove",
          "Adopt a baby elephant. A few dollars and you can visit the elephants as an adopter at other times. Got an Uber to the Orphanage...a little way out but mainly due to state of roads.",
          "I read Dame Sheldrik's Biography before I went to Kenya and suggest that ALL of the adults reading this do, too. It fills in, actually overflows, the goodness of her spirit that saved so many infant animals and teaches us to continue following her example. There can be nothing",
          "We almost didn't visit this foundation because I had felt like it was going to be too 'touristy'. Yes, there are plenty of tourists watching the elephants eat, play, and bathe. But it was just so interesting to see the young elephants interact with each other and to learn",
          "Went to see the how well the Elephants were looked after and was not disappointed. !4 young elephants kept at the trust which will be returned to the wild when they are ready. The trust is only opened for an hour so there is not a lot of interaction with humans.",
          "Great experience with the Baby elephants. The queu line to the entrance very disorganized. If you have children do not doubt and go.",

          "We had always wanted to go to the Trust but it is only open 1 hour a day 11-12. This trip we changed our plans so we could get there. To see the interaction of the elephants and their care givers is wonderful. You can touch them if they get close enough to you. I would",

          "My wife and I went to the sheldrick trust while in Nairobi and I decided to adopt an elephant (Larro) for her birthday. If you adopt an elephant ahead of time, you actually get to go at 5 p.m. instead of noon and have a much more private experience with the young elephants",

          "It\u2019s worth to go there, just t see the elephant babies and get the information about the elephants and the orphanage. Come min. 1/2 hour earlier, normally is quite crowded. If it\u2019s raining, be prepared to stand in deep mud.",
          "This is a must do in Nairobi where you get up close and personal with the baby elephants and see how they interact. Start lining up early like 10:15 or 10:30 if you want to get a good spot. They only open at 11am daily for 1-2 hours. you get to possibly touch an elephant if you",

          "Take a detour and have a day to remember. It is personal and humane. You never know what you might adopt.",
          "These baby elephants bring a smile and a tear to your eye at the same time - about losing a mom but getting great care now and a future chance to return to the wild. Can\u2019t help feeling happier after seeing them. Opportunity to adopt one for $50 US to see how their life",
          "This is an amazing experience. The Sheldrick Trust raises orphaned elephants until they can go back to the wild. I foster 3 babies so was able to visit them in the evening when they come back from the bush with their keepers. I highly recommend visiting the Sheldrick elephant",
          "The reviews are all true! I adopted an elephant (Musiara) a few years ago with the goal of making it here for my 50th birthday. We had a whole day planned around the Karen area and this was Number 1 for me. We went for the 11AM visit - it was so great to see all the young",
          "This was our 3rd visit to the elephant centre, and it is just as interesting as it was the first time! Our first adopted elephant has grown and is now in Tsavo, so this time we adopted a new one, whom we hope to follow during our next visits to Kenya",

          "What these people do is simply amazing. These poor orphans who are supported until they are able to get back to a protected area is loving work. It is amazing to learn about these elephants. Touch them. See them. Talk to their keepers. And to support them is just a few dollars",
          "I know this place for the past 25 years so my memories from the past were better. The Sheldricks ladies did a fantastic job over these years taking care of the orphans. Sadly, it became a very commercial place, with hundreds of obnoxious tourists. However, still worth to",
          "We visited our 3 baby elephants and one rhino, Dololo, Kiasa, Musiara and Maxwell. It was lovely seeing them race into the compound to their respective keepers for the bedtime milk. Maxwell, the rhino is blind so was in his compound already. We had an hour with our little",

          "We visited the morning session which is open to anyone and the evening session which is for people who have adopted a baby elephant. The morning one was very busy and muddy as it was raining. The evening session was more personal. It was in a different area to the morning",
          "The baby elephants are super cute ! It\u2019s a great way to see the way they eat, drink and bath. However, it would have been better if we got to interact with the elephants.",
          "I went as part of a tour and this is an excellent way to donate. The price was 500 shilling or $7USD ( obviously cheaper in Shilling). They are only open 11-12 and the reality is it is a show made to get yo to donate. Everyone lines up before 11 and then as a group are let",

          "Worth the \"adoption fee\" to get in after hours for an up close look at the elephants. If you go, hang back a bit when you go to see the babies come in from the park--- you will get a better photo as they approach you.",
          "We already adopted an elephant orphan before we flew to Nairobi. We liked the idea of the project and decided by adopting an elephant to Support it. As adopting parents we booked us in for the 5pm Session and were excited to See our little one. The elephants were so cute. And",
          "Don't miss a visit to the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust if you love elephants... it is very well run and you will never get any closer to juvenile elephants, unfortunately orphaned because of poaching and abandonment. You can also \"adopt\" one of them for a small fee and return later",

          "Our guide got us an amazing spot to view this activity. Although people were told to keep quiet they continued to make lots of noise so was a bit difficult sometimes to hear the commentry. That aside, it was great seeing the work that is done and being that close to the",

          "I very much enjoyed my visit to Sheldrick, scratched and rubbed young, orphan elephants trunks and ears. Very good, instructional lecture by curators. Only matter is that the place is (deservedly) quite popular, so it was rather crowded when I visited. Great for children. Photos",

          "This is something you will not see on safari...lots of baby elephants orphaned as the result of poachers for the most part. Come early when they open, as it gets very crowded and hard to get close.",

          "This is a very nice place to visit and learn about the conservation efforts being undertaken to save the lives of endangered elephants. I recommend.",
          "This has to be the most adorable place in Nairobi. Where else do you get to see baby elephants run around, play with each other, and feed off a bottle WHILE learning about elephants and supporting this non profit organization? They are only open 11am-12pm, so visiting does",
          "We enjoyed it! It\u2019s only open between 11am-12 pm and it\u2019s super popular with lots of visitors/ tourists so make sure you get in the queue early so that you get a good spot to see the baby elephants getting fed! Went here 10 yrs ago and it wasn\u2019t nearly as busy and you also got",
          "We visited here as part of a day trip around Nairobi. We imagined this would be busy, but not as busy as it actually was. Whilst being busy isn\u2019t a bad thing, it did mean that being able to see the baby elephants was a bit of a problem as we weren\u2019t the first people there. So if",

They only open from 11-12 and the que is big so I would suggest booking via a company as this meant less queuing time for us (We went with Natural World Kenya Safari) I was apprehensive about visiting an \u2018orphanage\u2019 when you hear so",

          "Elephant lovers will like the Nairobi Nursery. A better experience is staying at one of the integration units, of course, for a much higher price. For an hour with elephants, I'd sponsor one for $50 in order to be one of only 75 allowed in the facility at the 5pm visitation.",
          "OH my, to go to this wonderful orphanage of young elephants is a chance to have some optimism for the future of elephants. To see these young elephants come running when it is bottle time, is pure bliss! These young elephants would not have made it in the wild without help.Now",

          "Was so amazing to see these beautiful animals being cared for. Yes it's only an hour to view but it was worth it, seeing the baby elephants running in to get their bottles of milk and then playing with each other. The talk given was very informative and the gentleman answered",
          "Disappointed by the presence of large crowds and not much else apart from a handful of stall selling merchandise. Would have liked to see or hear about conservation and associated activities",
          "I was so excited to see the baby elephants that we visited twice: Once during the public viewing hours from 11 am to 12 pm and again for the private adopter's visit from 5 to 6 pm, which we arranged in advance. For the public viewing, make sure you arrived at least 30-45 minutes",

          "Out of all of the sanctuaries and rescues we visited on this trip, this is one I have zero doubts about. research this place before you go if you are concerned; it is well known and you find out a lot about it. It is a shelter where they rescue orphaned elephants from all over",
          "We turned up for the 11am show which was highly informative with information on how the group of elephants became orphans. The first lot of 7 baby elephants were adorable, running over to get their milk. If you are lucky, you get to touch them as they wander round towards the",

          "It's amazing to see the nice side of humans at David Sheldricks... Not only did my family from abroad enjoy watching the elephants, but every time I visit, it makes me happy seeing the animals happy and secure. Watching them run for food, play around, and getting to bed! Not",

          "The elephant trust Is only open for an hour each day so the number of tourists crowded into a relatively small viewing area can be a bit overwhelming. We visited as part of our tour and I'm glad we made it here. The handlers bring out about 2 baby elephants at a time in a fenced",
          "The shelter allows the public in from 11.00 am to 12.00 am for non-Trust members. Very reasonable price for non-residents. Excellent viewing point and sometimes you can touch some younger bolder elephants - but usual caveats - they are gentle but still wild animals! Watch out",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Nairobi. I will warn you the 11-12 touristy showing can be quite overwhelming and gobs of people, but it is worth going at least once. What I highly recommend is adopting an elephant for $50 for the year and book the bed down experience. Way",

          "Visited with my sister and found the place such a dedicated organisation supporting orphaned and injured baby elephants. We've both adopted an elephant after seeing the great work of the centre.",
          "Definitely worth going, even if you haven't sponsored an elephant. The babies are so sweet and you are allowed to pat them if they walk next to you. Plenty of opportunity for photos.",
          "Cannot tell you what a wonderful place this is to visit and see the wonderful way the people there are taking care of these orphan baby elephants! They have an adoption program that a person can give them $50 and they will send you monthly info on the Elephant you want to adopt.",

          "This project is fantastic and needed. The elephants are charming and in need of care! The only downside is the logistics of adopting one; they could have had a LOT more participants if they'd been set up to handle visitors a little better. This didn't change the experience;",
          "My second time here and the teens loved the babies. I noted quite an an addition to the stock. Did adopt one elephant, would love to see her grow up and return to the wild. A good reason for me to visit again and again.",

          "The center is great but it seems it's grown in popularity but hasn't adjusted to the crowds. Long lines even on weekdays and inevitable selfish people cutting the lines. Once you get in make sure to carve space on the rope or you won't see much. I don't know, grateful for the",
          "I adopted 4 babies, and consider this a very important and worth while endeavor and will continue to support them. The DSWT rely on donations to care for these adorable little guys. The facility is well run with incredibly dedicated and caring staff. The work they do is very",

          "Amazing experience seeing the Elephants. We were lucky to get close to the ropes and saw some cheeky baby elephants. The elephants come running down the hill to get fed (large bottles of milk). They play about in the mud and provide a lot of entertainment. There is a talk which",
          "I have, and so have my kids. I LOVE going there with my family. I can never get enough of the baby elephants. Although the interaction with humans is short, 1 hour, it's worth it. The narrative about the circumstances that the brought the babies to the foundation always makes",

          "Well worth a visit. We saw 13 baby elephants in two groups and were told their life stories and how they came to be at the elephant orphanage. Rather too many seem to get stuck down wells - perhaps an new well design is needed in the areas the elephants most often get trapped.",
          "Make sure you look at the material on the website in detail before you go, so you understand what this will be like. Many of the negative reviewers obviously didn't do their research. This is not a petting zoo, you don't get the opportunity to truly interact with the animals.",
          "Fabulous insight into the incredible work they do to help orphaned elephants. Well worth a visit. Be aware you can only visit between 11.00 and 12.00",
          "It\u2019s cute and nice being if you are going Safari skip it as you will see plenty in the Mara. It\u2019s best doing before safari rather than after as it will feel like an anticlimax. Only open hour a day so get ur timings right",
          "Best experience of my life. We got to do the private viewing at 5pm and got to hang out with the baby elephants one on one. Its an incredible thing they do for these elephants and so happy it exists.",
          "We visited the baby elephants along with 100\u2019s of others for the one hour opening of between 11-12. Was surprised by the long line when we arrived 1/2 before but the line moved quickly when the gates opened. The \u201cshow\u201d was just lovely. Baby elephants ran down from the nearby",

          "We had a wonderful time at the Orphanage. The elephants were too cute and we were very impressed with the staff. I felt the carers are doing a great job balancing allowing the public to watch and learn about the elephants while also not exploiting the animals. When someone in",
          "My Husband and I stopped here before our long flight home back to the States and I must say it was a wonderful way to end our trip. They teach you about each elephant and its wonderful to know there are people out there to take care of these babies.Such a wonderful cause !",
          "As a foster parent to some of the orphans in care DSWT was naturally my first stop when I arrived in Nairobi. The public visit was a little overcrowded with tourists but if you arrive early enough you won\u2019t get stuck at the back of the line and will secure a good spot to watch",
          "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been saving orphaned elephants for decades. These dedicated, selfless people are saving those special animals, one life at a time. This is certainly a place to visit if you want to encounter elephants and even more, a place to support in their",

          "This is well worth a trip if you have a morning in Nairobi. Everyone loves seeing baby elephants! It's only open from 11am to 12, but you'll want to be in the queue by 10.30am to guarantee a good spot. My advice is to go to the Giraffe Centre at 9am (1 hour is enough there) and",
          "The babies are so cute. You stand along a path as the run by to get to their pins for the night. Their keepers go with them to feed them milk and fresh greens. Some of the babies let you pet them, but not all. One really young one was down and asleep in minutes. It really is",
          "I have been an adopter for many years so a visit to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust area was on the top of my list. From the parking lot, there is a short walk to an area where one of the keepers gives an informative talk on their work. Elephants, in the morning, are",

          "We booked a private driver to take us to the Orphanage and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was a great introduction to conservation efforts in Kenya and a chance to get up close and if lucky personal with these young elephants. Take some water and wear a hat if the sun is",
          "You have to be here at 11am for the 1 hour show of the baby elephants feeding. It\u2019s only on once per day. They are very cute and you get to pat them if they come close. The foundation does wonderful work in saving these beautiful animals.",
          "An exceptional place to visit, to see just how great the David Sheldrick team are. They take abandoned baby Elephants, attend to their health, and eventually return them to the wild. To get this close and personal to young elephants is a very special experience.",
          "We (my parents and I) went to the elephant orphanage for the hour-long elephant feeding visit. It was undeniably fun to see the elephants playing and draining their milk bottles in less than 20 seconds. For $5 each (plus a cheap Bolt or Uber ride) it was worth it. Just don't",
          "This wildlife orphanage it wonderful. We watched the babies come out to play and be fed from giant bottles. There was no performance, thank goodness, but there was an educational talk about their work. At the end of the presentation, one could support their special work by",

          "A very overcrowded place. I could hardly see the hour-long feeding program. It is for a wonderful cause.",
          "This place is definitely well worth a visit. The small entrance fee of 500 Kenyan Shillings per person goes towards the care of the orphaned elephants as well as funds from shop sales of souvenirs. There is also a chance to sponsor an orphan to maintain the trust's project.",
          "They are doing great work but it\u2019s still captivity. Donate to the cause but go on safari. Elephants in the wild are so prevalent there is no need to go other than to support them in their cause to save orphans",

          "I had adopted 2 baby elephants before my trip to Nairobi. We went to the public viewing and then back again for the private viewing for those who adopted. It was awesome. The keepers are so loving and gentle with these baby orphans. It was heart warming to see & experience.",
          "We arrived at 10.15am and many people were gathering at the same time. Arriving early helps to gain a place at the rope so you're closer to the 14 baby elephants. Brilliant to see these animals so close and well looked after. Would highly recommend",

          "There is more to hear than to do or see. The bottom line is that the Trust is about salvaging deserted or injured baby elephants. You see them fed with big bottles of formula milk and hear more than you can do or see. If you have never been close to an elephant then it might",

          "The tip here is to stay to the end. The vast crowd thins out as the disinterested leave so you can get a decent view of these baby elephants. The work done by these keepers is magnificent to bring these wonderful animals to a place where they can go home to the reserves.",
          "Superb family fun to watch baby elephants play in the mud and dirt. The show runs from 11-12 each day, but you best arrive by 1030 to get ahead of the line...avoid going on weekends too as it will just be too crowded.",
          "The elephants are adorable, no doubt, but you must arrive very early to even see them properly. The orphanage only opens for one hour per day, which is rather commendable, so there is only one viewing. We could hardly see anything and our children quickly got bored (they were up",
          "Great place to stop while in Nairobi. It's a lot of fun, and the trainers are super knowledgeable. I recommend.",
          "We went to see the baby elephant feeding and there was quite a crowd. It was great to learn about the history of each elephant and the conservation efforts in place to ensure they\u2019re placed back in the wild. Super impressed.",
          "I adopted little Larro a few months before traveling to Kenya. I HAD to see her before leaving for home. We arranged a visit for fosters and it was fantastic. First, we see her and the other orphans running like wildfire for their dinner bottles, lol. Then we get to spent time",
          "Make sure that you include enough time in Nairobi to experience Sheldrick! An absolutely wonderful way to see these beautiful creatures up close and personal. Its well worthwhile adopting in advance and booking into the afternoon 5pm session prior to your trip.",
          "It is not everyday that you see elephants so close that you actually touch them. And not only can you stay close to them for about an hour but you know that the fee for the entrance goes to protect those orphans who lost their mother to poachers or other reasons. We learned more",
          "Definitely would recommend! Elephants are so cute and the staff explained their stories and the story of the center. You may get a chance to pet an elephant. They also seem very well treated. Entrance for tourist is 5 dollars or 500 shillings, which is perfectly fine and you are",
          "We recently visited this place on our Kenya Safari and we would recommend it as the work these guys are doing at David Sheldrick is commendable. Also a great place to take the kids as they will love interacting with the animals.",
          "The work done here is wonderful to help rescue orphaned elephants. The calves were amazing to watch and brought a big smile to my face. I will definitely be adopting one when I return home. My only negative is the fact that because it is only open for 1 hour for visitors it is",
          "just gorgeous, wanted to take one home with me but I think Customs might have had an issue. Wish i had realised my driver had no intention of going back when I asked to go the shop and he said 'later' - instead he took me to what was clearly a tacky tourist shop that his",
          "It is $7 to get in and the people that let in is so extensive so if you want a good spot at the front get there early. You can if your clever and do it in advance adopt a baby elephant for like $50 a year and book an appointment to go and feed your elephant at like 4pm/5pm, much",
          "The best experience, watching all the orphaned elephants coming from the bushes, to get their bottles of milk.",
          "It\u2019s only opened for 1 hour and therefore it attracts a huge crowd for that hour. If crowded tourist traps bother you don\u2019t go but I am impressed and feel the work they do is essential, as this is how they fund the great work ... I therefore have no problem hanging out looking"

        "wiki": "Maasai Mara, also known as Masai Mara, and locally simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok, Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin. Their description of the area when looked at from afar: \"Mara\" means \"spotted\" in the local Maasai language, due to the many short bushy trees which dot the landscape.\nMaasai Mara is one of the most famous and important wildlife conservation and wilderness areas in Africa, world-renowned for its exceptional populations of lion, African leopard, cheetah and African bush elephant. It also hosts the Great Migration, which secured it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, and as one of the ten Wonders of the World. \nThe Greater Mara ecosystem encompasses areas known as the Maasai Mara National Reserve, the Mara Triangle, and several Maasai Conservancies, including Koiyaki, Lemek, Ol Chorro Oirowua, Mara North, Olkinyei, Siana, Maji Moto, Naikara, Ol Derkesi, Kerinkani, Oloirien, and Kimintet.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen it was originally established in 1961 as a wildlife sanctuary the Mara covered only 520 km2 (200 sq mi) of the current area, including the Mara Triangle. The area was extended to the east in 1961 to cover 1,821 km2 (703 sq mi) and converted to a game reserve. The Narok County Council (NCC) took over management of the reserve at this time. Part of the reserve was given National Reserve status in 1974, and the remaining area of 159 km2 (61 sq mi) was returned to local communities. An additional 162 km2 (63 sq mi) were removed from the reserve in 1976, and the park was reduced to 1,510 km2 (580 sq mi) in 1984.In 1994, the TransMara County Council (TMCC) was formed in the western part of the reserve, and control was divided between the new council and the existing Narok County Council. In May 2001, the not-for-profit Mara Conservancy took over management of the Mara Triangle.The Maasai people make up a community that spans across northern, central and southern Kenya and northern parts of Tanzania. As pastoralists, the community holds the belief that they own all of the cattle in the world. The Maasai rely off of their lands to sustain their cattle, as well as themselves and their families. Prior to the establishment of the reserve as a protected area for the conservation of wildlife and wilderness, the Maasai were forced to move out of their native lands.\nTradition continues to play a major role in the lives of modern day Maasai people, who are known for their tall stature, patterned shukas and beadwork. It is estimated that there are approximately half a million individuals that speak the Maa language and this number includes not only the Maasai but also Samburu and Camus people in Kenya.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe total area under conservation in the Greater Maasai Mara ecosystem amounts to almost 1,510 km2 (580 sq mi). It is the northernmost section of the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, which covers some 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi) in Tanzania and Kenya. It is bounded by the Serengeti Park to the south, the Siria / Oloololo escarpment to the west, and Maasai pastoral ranches to the north, east and west. Rainfall in the ecosystem increases markedly along a southeast\u2013northwest gradient, varies in space and time, and is markedly bimodal. The Sand, Talek River and Mara River are the major rivers draining the reserve. Shrubs and trees fringe most drainage lines and cover hillslopes and hilltops.\nThe terrain of the reserve is primarily open grassland with seasonal riverlets. In the south-east region are clumps of the distinctive acacia tree. The western border is the Esoit (Siria) Escarpment of the East African Rift, which is a system of rifts some 5,600 km (3,500 mi) long, from Ethiopia's Red Sea through Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and into Mozambique. Wildlife tends to be most concentrated here, as the swampy ground means that access to water is always good, while tourist disruption is minimal. The easternmost border is 224 km (139.2 mi) from Nairobi, and hence it is the eastern regions which are most visited by tourists.\nThe rains are biannual, with two distinct rainy seasons. Local farmers have referred to these as the 'long rains' which last approximately six to eight weeks in April and May and the 'short rains' in November and December which last approximately four weeks. \nElevation: 1,500\u20132,180 m (4,920\u20137,150 ft);\nRainfall: 83 mm (3.3 in)/month;\nTemperature range: 12\u201330 \u00b0C (54\u201386 \u00b0F)\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\nWildebeest, topi, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle migrate into and occupy the Mara reserve, from the Serengeti plains to the south and Loita Plains in the pastoral ranches to the north-east, from July to October or later. Herds of all three species are also resident in the reserve.\nAll members of the \"Big Five\" (lion, leopard, elephant, Cape buffalo, black and white rhinos) are found here all year round. The population of black rhinos was fairly numerous until 1960, but it was severely depleted by poaching in the 1970s and early 1980s, dropping to a low of 15 individuals. Numbers have been slowly increasing, but the population was still only up to an estimated 23 in 1999. The Maasai Mara is the only protected area in Kenya with an indigenous black rhino population, unaffected by translocations, and due to its size, is able to support one of the largest populations in Africa.Hippopotami and crocodiles are found in large groups in the Mara and Talek rivers. Hyenas, cheetahs, jackals, servals and bat-eared foxes can also be found in the reserve. The plains between the Mara River and the Esoit Siria Escarpment are probably the best area for game viewing, in particular regarding lion and cheetah.\nWildebeest are the dominant inhabitants of the Maasai Mara, and their numbers are estimated in the millions. Around July of each year, these animals migrate north from the Serengeti plains in search of fresh pasture, and return to the south around October. The Great Migration is one of the most impressive natural events worldwide, involving some 1,300,000 blue wildebeest, 500,000 Thomson's gazelles, 97,000 Topi, 18,000 common elands, and 200,000 Grant's zebras.Antelopes can be found, including Grant's gazelles, impalas, duikers and Coke's hartebeests. The plains are also home to the distinctive Masai giraffe. The large roan antelope and the nocturnal bat-eared fox, rarely present elsewhere in Kenya, can be seen within the reserve borders.\nMore than 470 species of birds have been identified in the park, many of which are migrants, with almost 60 species being raptors. Birds that call this area home for at least part of the year include: vultures, marabou storks, secretary birds, hornbills, crowned cranes, ostriches, long-crested eagles, African pygmy-falcons and the lilac-breasted roller, which is the national bird of Kenya.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Maasai Mara is administered by the Narok County government. The more visited eastern part of the park known as the Maasai Mara National Reserve is managed by the Narok County Council. The Mara Triangle in the western part is managed by the Trans-Mara county council, which has contracted management to the Mara Conservancy since the early 2000s.The outer areas are conservancies that are administered by Group Ranch Trusts of the Maasai community, although this approach has been criticised for benefitting just a few powerful individuals rather than the majority of landowners. Although there has been a rise in fencing on private land in recent years, the wildlife roam freely across both the reserve and conservancies.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe Maasai Mara is a major research centre for the spotted hyena. With two field offices in the Mara, the Michigan State University based Kay E. Holekamp Lab studies the behaviour and physiology of this predator, as well as doing comparison studies between large predators in the Mara Triangle and their counterparts in the eastern part of the Mara.A flow assessment and trans-boundary river basin management plan between Kenya and Tanzania was completed for the river to sustain the ecosystem and the basic needs of 1 million people who depend on its water.The Mara Predator Project also operates in the Maasai Mara, cataloging and monitoring lion populations throughout the region. Concentrating on the northern conservancies where communities coexist with wildlife, the project aims to identify population trends and responses to changes in land management, human settlements, livestock movements and tourism. \nSince October 2012, the Mara-Meru Cheetah Project has worked in the Mara monitoring cheetah population, estimating population status and dynamics, and evaluating the predator impact and human activity on cheetah behavior and survival. The head of the Project, Elena Chelysheva, was working in 2001-2002 as Assistant Researcher at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Maasai-Mara Cheetah Conservation Project. At that time, she developed original method of cheetah identification based on visual analysis of the unique spot patterns on front limbs (from toes to shoulder) and hind limbs (from toes to the hip), and spots and rings on the tail. Collected over the years, photographic data allows the project team to trace kinship between generations and build Mara cheetah pedigree. The data collected helps to reveal parental relationship between individuals, survival rate of cubs, cheetah lifespan and personal reproductive history.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe Maasai Mara is one of the most famous safari destinations in Africa. Entry fees are currently US$ 70 for adult non-East African Residents per 24 hours (if staying at a property inside the Reserve) or US$ 80 if outside the reserve, and $40 for children. There are a number of lodges and tented camps catering for tourists inside or bordering the Reserve and within the various separate Conservancies which border the main reserve. However, the main reserve is unfenced even along the border with Serengeti (Tanzania) which means there is free movement of wildlife throughout the ecosystem.  \nAlthough one third of the whole Maasai Mara in the western part if the larger reserve, The Mara Triangle has only two permanent lodges within its boundaries, namely the Mara Serena Lodge and Little Governors Camp (compared to the numerous camps and lodges on the Narok side) and has well maintained, all weather gravel roads. The rangers patrol regularly which means that there is less poaching and excellent game viewing. There is also strict control over vehicle numbers around animal sightings, allowing for a better experience when out on a game drive. Most lodges within the region charge higher rates during the Migration season, although the Maasai Mara is home to prolific wildlife year-round. \nThere are several airfields which serve the camps and lodges in the Maasai Mara, including Mara Serena Airstrip, Musiara Airstrip and Keekorok, Kichwa Tembo, Ngerende Airport, Ol Kiombo and Angama Mara Airstrips, and several airlines such as SafariLink and AirKenya fly scheduled services from Nairobi and elsewhere multiple times a day. Helicopter flights over the reserve are limited to a minimum height of 1,500 ft.\nGame drives are the most popular activity in the Maasai Mara, but other activities include hot air ballooning, nature walks, photographic safaris and cultural experiences.\n\n\n== Big Cat Diary ==\n\nThe BBC Television show titled \"Big Cat Diary\" was filmed in the Maasai Mara. The show followed the lives of the big cats living in the reserve. The show highlighted scenes from the Reserve's Musiara marsh area and the Leopard Gorge, the Fig Tree Ridge areas and the Mara River, separating the Serengeti and the Maasai Mara.\n\n\n== Photography competition ==\nIn 2018, the Angama Foundation, a non-profit affiliated with Angama Mara, one of the Mara's luxury safari camps, launched the Greatest Maasai Mara Photographer of the Year competition, showcasing the Mara as a year-round destination and raise funds for conservation initiatives active in the Mara. The inaugural winner was British photographer Anup Shah. The 2019 winner was Lee-Anne Robertson from South Africa.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nA study funded by WWF and conducted by ILRI between 1989 and 2003 monitored hoofed species in the Mara on a monthly basis, and found that losses were as high as 75 percent for giraffes, 80 percent for common warthogs, 76 percent for hartebeest, and 67 percent for impala. The study blames the loss of animals on increased human settlement in and around the reserve. The higher human population density leads to an increased number of livestock grazing in the park and an increase in poaching. The article claims, \"The study provides the most detailed evidence to date on the declines in the ungulate (hoofed animals) populations in the Mara and how this phenomenon is linked to the rapid expansion of human populations near the boundaries of the reserve.\"The rise of local populations in areas neighbouring the reserve has led to the formation of conservation organisations such as the Mara Elephant Project who aim to ensure the peaceful and prosperous co-existence of humans alongside wildlife.  Human wildlife conflict is seen as a leading threat to the reserve as the population continues to grow.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nOlare Orok Conservancy\nList of national parks of Kenya\n\n\n== References ==\n\nWalpole, M.; Karanja, G.G.; Sitati, N.W.; Leader-Williams (2003).

          "The highlight of our trip to Mara was seeing the migration at the Mara river. A once in a lifetime experience to see the Wildebeest migrating. An amazing scene of nature it was. We did our safari with Explorer Kenya and they made sure we got a good spot to see it.",
          "We went to the Mara River to see the migration and as we waited saw a lion feeding. You have to be patient to see the migration with some tour vans at times disrupting the animals. It was a great place.",
          "Spent 3 days doing game drives and also a hot air balloon ride in Masai Mara. Definitely one of the top 10 parks in the world. It was unfortunate that when I was there, the wildebeest have already crossed the river. Understand that the crossing started earlier in 2019. Perhaps",
          "We went to where the migration crossing occurs and managed to see the tail end of it. Unbelievable how many there were!! Also had a tour by the rangers by the water to view the hippos and crocodiles Toilets are a bit on the average side, but usable and did the trick",
          "The largest crocodiles you will ever see anywhere. Zebra and wildebeest seem to be crossing daily so there\u2019s always excitement around it. It\u2019s a beautiful place to relax while having lunch and watching life carry-on with perhaps the occasional hippo wandering down stream looking",

          "The washrooms at the park entrance we used were pretty much out of commission. Not flushing and disgusting. The roads were in pretty bad shape. If the Kenyan gov. is eager enough to take tourist $'s they may want to think about making this park a bit more accessible. We were",
          "This is a must visit for anyone visiting the Masai Mara. We had a good your guide who took us to the very edge of the river after hours of driving and the sight was on point. This is where the wildebeest cross so it has crocodiles and hippos. A must visit.",
          "We drove to the Mara River on one of our safari excursions. We weren\u2019t at the infamous crossing, but we still enjoyed a rewarding scene. There were more hippos than we could count, and two brothers were behaving as one might expect. We also saw crocodiles. We were on a hill and",

          "Went for our second time at the crossing. This time we felt in the middle of maybe a million wildebeest, zebras, antelopes etc. climate change seems to have confused them as they normally cross The Mara from Tanzania to Kenya for greener pastures. Now both seem dry or wet",
          "We spent several hours each on two days trying to find gnus crossing the river. We did see 3 groups come to Waters edge, but not go in. We also saw crocs and hippos.",
          "We had been to Masai Mara national reserve almost 15 years ago but not seen so many animals as this time. This time we went during the great migration of wildebeest and it was an incredible experience. We saw all big fives in the first game drive itself. One day we saw almost",
          "We saw the Big 5 in 5 runs and what we really liked was it was was crowded. We never had more than 4 to 6 vehicles around us and lots of times there were none!",
          "We saw the Masai pride of lions and lioness sleeping in the afternoon in the river bed just before sunset . Rain fell lightly and there was a gentle trickle of water for the animals to come down to the river bank",
          "We went to see the crossing. Not recommended. There are too many there and cars are racing for spots to photo. This affects the animals behavior. Better to leave it out of your itinary.",
          "We spent a few days here watching the huge amounts of wildebeest and zebras cross the river. It was spectacular. Like a National Geographic special. It was an amazing experience that we will always remember. Also saw lots of hippos in the river and crocs. Much other wildlife",
          "Very disturbing to see that the park rangers of the National Park of Masai Mara are doing nothing to control the reckless drivers and huge number of tour trucks.",
          "What an experience we watched a crossing that involved over 3000 animals Zebras and Wildebeest. We saw the crocodiles trying to capture these animals as they crossed and in some cases they were successful what a true view of the wild.",
          "Suggest going during the great migration. Wildebeast everywhere. Lions, leapords, heyna,elephant,zebra .Must see, note the roads are bumpy and the trek is long.",
          "Action at the Mara in July: If you are expecting to witness what you have seen on NatGeo and Discovery channels, keep your expectations real. It's an amazing experience what so ever. They let you watch the river from the bridge however, ask your guide to take you a bit away by",
          "this experience can never be guaranteed. Wildebeest are often accompanied by zebras which have excellent vision, and the sight of a single crocodile can delay the crossing by days. In truth, we spent most of the time waiting large herts of wildebeest to cross. When finally they",
          "Croc's and Hippo's in the wild. What's not to like? The section we visited had a herd of Hippo's totally submerged to begin with. Unnoticeable. Then gradually began to make their way to shallower depths. Like walking into a wildlife program. Amazing. The Croc's were motionless.",
          "It was wonderful to watch the hippos, there were a couple just a few hours old. Also amazing was the elephant herds. No words can really explain watching these majestic animals. It was for me a humbling experience. At night whilst in bed,you could hear the animals down at the",
          "Please schedule some time during your safari to visit and patiently enjoy the surreal Mara River. Truly amazing!!! Loads of Hippos, Crocs, and if you are ready to wait enough you may witness the lifetime experience of witnessing Zebra/ Widebeast river crossing!!! Just WOW!!!",
          "Very Nice place, good service, good food, need a bit of tlc and it is place on the Brinks of the Mara river but from 3 out of 4 tents we had you couldent see the river due to bushes and weed a bit dissapointing",
          "My dream was to witness a river crossing during the migration... while the timing wasn't perfect, we did get to see several hippos and alligators - definitely a worthwhile stop while in the Masai Mara.",
          "It is incredibly amazing!! Not the largest or the widest river, but when you can see it from above... Plus being able to see part of the migration coming straight to the river it is like being part of a movie. Even I didn't see wildabeast and zebras actually crossing the",
          "Full of wildlife and amazing views all along its banks and a Privilege to visit ,especially if you witness a crossing during the Migration",
          "We visited the Mara river just 3 weeks after the Mass Migration. Saw Hippos and Crocodiles and had Picnic Lunch at the river Bridge looking into Tanzania. The guides give a really good insight into the River and wildlife.",
          "The real nature is here...there you can feel the inner peace, see the real life of the Wild.If you are planning to visit Kenya , make sure that you don't miss this magnificent place",
          "We had Bamm tours and safaris who booked our safari through Francis... and we never got disappointed. Special thanks to Evanson for such a lovely time. A good river to have a picnic at the end and a place to see hippos and crocodile.",
          "Well the river crossing is the most interesting part by gnus as you have seen on many international channels.The crocs wait for the gnus to jump and they make a kill. It's a beautiful river with meandering full of birdlife hippos and attracts large number of herbivores.An",
          "We drove to the Mara River from our game reserve. It took us around 4 hours to get there as our driver took us to see animals, lots of animals to see, pretty brilliant. no place like this",
          "It is heaven on earth, the scenery and the wildlife are in such beautiful co-existence. You can find the big five everyday and much more. There are wonderful lodges and tented camp sites all over. No wonder it is one of the seven wonders of the world when migration is going on",
          "We drove for a very long time to get to the Mara river and was not expecting to get there and be surrounded by hundreds of people. Once we got there a ranger walked us a short distance along the river, where we saw hippo and small crocs. We only really went to see the",
          "The Mara is such a magical place that we feel like a piece of our hearts was left behind. We were changed for the better, seeing the wonders of our extraordinary planet and meeting the residents, who are so in tune with nature. There are no words to describe it and it far",
          "I would recommend going to the Mara River when driving through Masai Mara to see hippos and crocodiles, it feels like being in a documentary of National Geographic. Amazing!",
          "It\u2019s a great walk along the river in the shade. Lots of hippos and crocs in the river telling you that you are almost in their way. There\u2019s government guides here, they will explain you well about the habitat around the river.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed each and every single minute!!!!! I was fortunate to see the beautiful migration of the zebras and wildebeests!!! It was something that I have wanted to see since I was a child.",
          "I traveled to the Mara River with guides Julius and Julius. I was a solo traveler. I felt very safe on my safari and saw an incredible amount of wildlife.",
          "We went with my husband and my teenager son. It was great experience.I think instead of wasting time on travelling to get Maasai Mara 7 hours one side, better to take a flight. This way you can save money on staying in Nairobi and energy to explore your area. Safari experience",
          "We saw multiple groups of Hippos and a few crocodiles. The migration season was a bit delayed and hence couldn't see wildebeests crossing the stream. The local guides are helpful and explain all aspects of the river in detail. Tipping is suggested. There are restrooms available",
          "We left the camp early and travelled to the Mara River to an area where the Wilderbeast and Zebra cross. We saw quite a few nile crocs as well. Our picnic lunch was great and the drive to and from the camp exciting as we saw many varities of animals. I would recommend this",
          "We were lucky and hit the Wildebeest migration. Watching them cross the river is a sight to see. We even saw one wildebeest get nailed by a crocodile as it got separated from the group. YIKES - nature at its rawest. Watching the wildebeest come down the hill and then decide",
          "Took a walk with the ranger (Maina) at mara River and yes it was a nice experience he was very friendly the experience was amazing to get closer to the hippos and crocs",
          "We saw so many wild game from hippos to crocodiles, wildebeest, leopards, lioness, cheetahs, lion, topi, varieties of gazelle, zebra, giraffe, elephants Impalas, hyenas, jackals, water buffalo, And even a black necked slitting cobra snake!! So many different species of birds.",
          "There really is no place like it. The Mara river is some spectacle. To see the migration of wild beast at the Mara was truly magical. It makes you appreciate nature.",
          "The 70 kilometres journey from the gate is teeming with a rich and wide variety of wildlife and birds. During migration it is hectic, alternatively it will be a quiet spot for the hippos and crocs. But it is the breathtaking journey of discovery there and and back will be your",
          "Great experience to see the Mara river. We tried to get a glimpse of the wildebeest migration, and we could see the large heard, but noone were ready to cross the river the day we were there. But we got to see all the others: hippos, Crocs, a buffalo gang who tried to kill a",
          "A wonderful part of the Masai Mara park. This winding river is a great place to view animals crossing from one side of the Mara to the other. You'll likely see crocodiles and many hippo's in there, along with other animals grazing above the river. It's interesting to watch",
          "Although we went when the area was experiencing a drought, there was still plenty of wildlife to observe. The crocodiles were few and far between but the wildebeest and zebra were in abundance. There were plenty of hippos and water buffalo to see, too. We were able to eat",
          "Breathtaking witnessing nature at its most raw - seas of wildebeast crossing the Mara. Magnificant, a privilege to view",
          "A visit to Mara River was organized by Enkewa camp crew. The view was breathtaking with so many Hippopotamus and crocodile in the river. We had our breakfast near that and it was an awesome experience.",
          "On a trip to the Masai Mara definitely stop at the river to see crocodiles and hippos and other wildlife along the way.",
          "A mustn\u2019t miss visit to the crossing used by wildebeest in the annual migration through Tanzania to Kenya. Dozens of hippos and some decent size crocodiles! Very good guide and well worth the walk along the river",
          "There is a migration of animals from masai mara to serengeti and vice versa twice a year wherein wild animals in millions cross the mara river for greener pastures. This is a sight to watch. Unbelievable is the word. You must have watched it on Animal Planet or National",
          "Good place to see Hippos and crocodiles. Wild bees migrations can observed during seasons. one of the must visit location of the Mara park",
          "We hit the Maasai 4th of the parks on my trip to Kenya after;Samburu, Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Lake Nakuru, they were all excellent but the Maasai blew them all away. On our full day here, we did a long game drive down to the river which is the border with Tanzania to see",
          "We had a lovely pre-packed lunch by the Mara river. The river divides the forest of Masai Mara in Kenya and the Serengeti in Tanzania. It was really blissful to watch the river right in the middle of the forest and observe the hippos playing in the water. There are very friendly",
          "Just arrived to the reserve, checked in, and started our afternoon game drive. Huge number of animals like antelopes, giraffes, hippos, hyenas, leopards, Elephants and wildebeest. What an awesome experience, all in one. I didn\u2019t saw any hunting because it occurs usually either",
          "The river is quite long and winding with many vantage points to view the Hippos cooling themselves and Crocks roaming the river and the banks. At the right times Wildebeest and Zebra cross in huge numbers",
          "It was nice to go to Mara River but its dry and there was very little water though it was a good experience!!",
          "We were open mouthed at the beauty of this amazing piece of nature. Wildlife, scenery, the sheer beauty is breathtaking",
          "Once in the park, this is a \"must detour\". The river contains a lot of hippos and crocodiles. On the other side of the river, one can see giraffes and other animals, the whole setting is very scenic.",
          "We stopped by Mara River where a uniformed soldier belonging to the anti poaching unit took us on a walking tour. He was knowledgeable about the hippos and crocodiles living in the river. He had a fully loaded magazine in the machine gun he carried. He told us about hippo",
          "Watching the Marsh pride as the adult Lions returned from a nights hunting, to be greeted by 2 cubs, then seeing the cubs feed! trully a morning not to be forgotten.",
          "Beautiful gift of nature to be enjoyed in the wilderness of Mara and African savannah. Often gets to see rhinos, birds and elephants drinking water here",
          "when we where in the mara we visited the mara to look for the lions and the leopard and was not disappointed we saw both of them",
          "The Mara River is definitely one of the highlights of the Mara. It provides you an ideal chance to view crocodiles make delicious meals out of the animals drinking or crossing the river.",
          "We once again crossed the Mara River. Hippos were never too far away. We enjoyed more of the large cats.",
          "The river was semi dry still we spotted few animals which was nice. I have seen the great migration and it was great to see the place live",
          "The wildlife is off the charts , you can't even put it in to words. When i explain it to people and show the photos they think its not real",
          "It was really nice to visit this migratory route though there no animals migrating but noticed lots of crocodiles and hippos being idle they were in large numbers.",
          "when i visited it was the tail end of the crossing . .We did sight a few of the wilder best crossing the Maara river . But the ride was hot hot hot .I know it is Africa ... be prepared for a bumpy wild ride and the heat .and take packed food . Pray your vehicle does not break",
          "Our driver, David, over the 3 days we were there managed to find us the Big Five plus so many more animals. Seeing a leopard sitting up a tree then a pride of 4 lioness, one with her two cubs was awesome. This should be on everyone bucket list to do. One negative, the 6 hr",
          "Fantastic place to visit. Full of hippo and crocs. This is where the migration happens but you would have to visit Aug to Oct to see thisb",
          "We were taken by our guide to the Mara River for breakfast riverside and to watch the hippos hanging out. It was shocking to see so many in one place- I think we stopped couting at 40! We got some great pictures, enjoyed a beautiful breakfast spot and were entertained with",
          "Amazing calm view of hippos and crocodiles. The hippos come out do the water at night to feed from grass in an amazing procession that\u2019s worth exploring carefully with guides from the hotel. Enjoy!!!",
          "Everything can happen at Mara river. We have seen here the biggest hippos ever, some crocs, many beautiful birds and lazy lions not far from the river.",

          "Day 2 of our 8 day safari. Fred, our amazing driver took the jeep all the way to the Mara river, from the Mara conservancy. As we watched the hippos and crocs living side by side,Fred explained that they live together in mutual respect. If a croc ever touched a hippo calf, the",
          "I saw crocodiles & hippos in the Mara River. It was November, so there was some water in parts of the river where the hippos swallowed, but in other parts it looked quite dry. There's not my h else to aay so have a look at the photos.",
          "The river is the spot of one of the major animal migrations to and from the Serengeti with all its dangers!",
          "We saw hippopotamus and crocodiles in abundance as we were outside the migration period, but nonetheless it was amazing experience, and highly recommended!",
          "While the river contains hippopotami and crocodiles the surrounding area is bountiful with wildlife even without the migration. Lions, leopards, elephants, giraffe, cape buffalo, black rhinoceros, hyenas, cheetahs, jackals, wildebeest, zebras, impalas, gazelles, topi, elands,",
          "We slept not 10 steps from the river hearing the hippos and birds. Unfortunately it was apparently the first year in recorded time the migration did not occur because of the heavy rains and lush grass in Tanzania. Spent several days watching and hoping for a migration - saw a",
          "Although the migration has happened, we still saw akl animals except rhinos, very few are left the park. Our guide was fabulous.",
          "Unfortunately we didn\u2019t see the wildebeest migration which is meant to be spectacular but we did see lots of hippos in their natural environment as well as lots of crocs.",
          "Visit early in the month when there are fewer tourists. We enjoyed seeing copious birds, elephants, zebra, hippos, crocodiles, giraffe, wildebeest, hyenas, and so many more animals I can't list them all here.",
          "The residents (crocs) were in abundance even though the migration was long passed.The Mara is a very impressive river..a must see.",
          "River famous for its crocodiles and the annual wildebeest migration. It tends to be busy during migration season but such a spectacle",
          "We heard a zebra \"bark\" to get his herd to cross the Mara River from Tanzania's Serengeti back to the Mara grasslands of Kenya. Once he herded them across his call sounded more like the bray of a donkey. We stopped a a hippo area and walked the river bank with an armed guide",
          "Loved this area, saw a giraffe in river, and soooo many crocs and wildebeest and hippos... bes part of my safari.",
          "Mara river is the place everyone has to visit if you love wildlife. Hippos, elephants, crocodiles and the banks of the river. One of the most beautiful places in Africa.",
          "Anticipation waiting for the wilder beast to cross the river was an awesome experience. And so many animals.",
          "having seen a lot of wildlife on the Mara Plains , we decided we just had to drive toward the river .We were also told that some of the Zebra and wildebeast were still crossing the river this year . yes , we did see many many hippos in the river and one huge crocodile not far",
          "One of the fascinating Rivers in the world! The Wildebeest crossing fascinates me. They are worth going to a full day game drive to watch.",
          "Fantastic experience just wow . I have dreamt of this trip all my life and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve now done it",
          "Mara river is the place everyone has to visit, if you love Africa. Hippos, crocodiles and the banks of the river where you can see paths of the animals.",
          "In a 2 hours game drive, we saw so many animals in its own environment and it was just incredible. We did a total of 3 game drives. We thought we have seen everything we aimed for. Long and behold, another amazing surprise was around the corner. The only downside was there were",
          "The long winding Mara river cutting across the endless savannah of Masai Mara, is the life line for the diverse animals which it sustains, also the few camps located on its banks are ideal setting to view game and hippos and crocs and some birds too.",
          "Must see the Mara River it's a great site of ample wildebeest crossing while crocs try to kill. Great place to see nature at it's best and take all the photos. Highly recommended during migration.",
          "After having visited Kenya and the national parks for some 18 years I had never actually encountered the beauty and vastness of the actual migration. It was such big tick on the bucket list and days that I shall never forget ! Seeing the 1000\u2019s of zebras and wildebeest",
          "This was a destination on one game drive. We drive to the gates that led to the Mara triangle, and had a picnic lunch by the park office (yay washrooms!) amidst tricky vervet monkeys and baboons that will steal your lunch if you aren\u2019t vigilant. Right by thebridge there are",
          "Maasai Mara National Reserve is an area of preserved savannah wilderness in southwestern Kenya, along the Tanzanian border. Its animals include lions, cheetahs, elephants, zebras and hippos. Wildebeest traverse its plains during their annual migration.",
          "We camped on the banks of the Mara River and there was never a dull moment with nonstop activity. There were numerous large crocodiles who sat lazily about but the hippos were the star of the show with their antics and bo9ming roars. They serenaded us thru the night and even",
          "Best chances of seeing your favourite Big 5 (except rhino is very rare!) and loads of other animals! We were also amazed with the amount of elephants, lions, zebras and giraffes we saw!",
          "A group of nine of us spent six blissfully idyllic days within Masai Mara National Reserve from 15th to 21st September 2018. We rode in two safari jeeps from Malaika Camp. The Masai driver-guides were very efficient, had off-road permits allowing them to take us to places",
          "We really much enjoyed our Safaei to the Mara river surroundings and the Maasai Mara. There are amazing landscapes and so much wildlife ! The only thing that disappointed us is the very little number of Rhinos (we didn't see any) and Elephants (we saw 4), which is probably",
          "The Masai Mara is well-preserved and well-managed, and the game viewing is exceptional. Repeated visits in the same area are better than scattered viewing because one becomes accustomed to the patterns of wildlife activity and so sees more.",
          "Crocodiles lurk, hippos lounge, lions lie in wait and herds of zebras and wildebeest stand on the banks, waiting for the first brave-heart to take the plunge. You may or may not see any action for days, even though the herds may gather by the river during migration, but there is",
          "Must visit. Sight to see is the wildebeest crossing the river. The river is not very wide but goes across all the way. Has a lit of crocodiles and hippos, which is a sight to see. Hippo pool breakfast arranged by Serena Lodge on the river, is an amazing experience.",
          "We arrived at the Mara river to be greeted by a lazy lion resting under a tree. The wildebeest were congregating to try and cross the river. The banks were so steep and deep inside the canyon where the river sat were huge hippos and crocs.",
          "I have visited Serengeti/Masai Mara half a dozen times, but experienced my first river crossings at the Mara river this October. Incredible scenes! So many animals adjacent to the river... an amazing place to visit!",
          "This is what you hope for and imagine a trip to Kenya will be like. The wide open spaces, the beautiful landscape, the stunning light and, most importantly, the absolutely amazing wildlife! The animals are there, you just have to know where/when to look for them. Having",
          "I think the most exiting time to visit the Mara river is in July- August. That is the height of the great migration and the crocodiles are still hungry. When we were there in the beginning of October most of the animals had crossed and the crocs were fat and lazy. It is still",
          "We toured Kenya visiting the Masai River and saw lions amongst others. Bring your camera and binoculars and take home fabulous memories.",
          "A complete echo system in an area that can be driven in a couple days! That's great. Make sure you book a reliable driver and a guide, and take your time and you will be rewarded.",
          "When the Great Migration is on this is the place you will want to be in Kenya. The Wildebeest and Zebras cross the river to get to the feeding grounds of new grasses on the other side. This means they run the risk of being attacked and eaten by Crocodiles. The area surrounding",
          "It's so quiet and serene, at least when we visited. Flanked by Savanna grasslands on both sides, it just a pleasure to sit on it's shores and watch the surroundings. Were so lucky to see the river crossing too.",

          "We sat patient for a couple of hours as a herd of Zebra got closer and closer to the river. Eventually one brave soul decided to go for it and made it about a third of the way across before being spotted by a crocodile and making a sharp exit avoiding the crocs clamp. A great",
          "The activities in this river is unbelievable! From hippos to the biggest crocs I have ever seen. We watched for 2 days as the zebras tried to do a crossing, but the crocs would not let them, but we were lucky to see one wildebeest do a quick crossing in his own. We loved our",
          "We had a guide who showed us some interesting features of the river and gave us lots of information about the wildlife. We saw hippos and crocodiles but, unfortunately, not the wilderbeast crossing.",
          "The Mara river flows across the Masai Mara National Reserve. This river is often used by the Wildebeest and zebras to migrate in search of fresh grass. The water in the river is shallow and the riverbed is rocky so it facilitates migration. Migration is a lifetime sight and a",
          "A truly beautiful place, and a great view of the crocs waiting for that one unfortunate buffalo! Well worth the longer trip out that a normal safari trip",
          "The Mara river is a great place to see crocodiles, hippos, and zebra (depending on season the zebras migrate in North American autumn). The safari to get to the river was amazing! We saw so many incredible animals and birds and closer than I imagined! I highly recommend at",
          "2018 in the Mara could be disappointing for most expecting to see a mass migration as it would appear the animals have not moved north out of Tanzania due to plentiful rain and good grass levels but we jagged a small crossing of Zebras on our last afternoon drive to experience a",
          "We spent the day going to the Mara river. It was beautiful countryside but there was no migration this year. We did see zebra around but no crossings. It was hot. Drink lots of water to avoid dehydration.",
          "We did booked the 4 days and 3 nights tour to Masai Mara last month with our friends. One thing is that we did stayed for the 2 full day close to Mara river watching wildebeest and Zebras closing mara river from Serengeti. Alot of wildlife including the crocodiles and big",
          "Great to see crossing of zebra and wilderbeast, you may have to wait until they pluck up courage to run the gauntlet of the crocodiles",
          "Will this be the year that the wildebeest did not cross the Mara River? Having visited Masai Mara to view a migration it seemed that it would be a non event. However on the last day of of our visit we sat late afternoon with about 40 vehicles when about 700 Zebra gathered.",
          "The river was teaming with life each time we visited. Hippos, crocs, birds of all sorts, warthogs, monkeys, elephants, all using the river to their contentment. And, of course, the wildebeest migration is fabulous! It is an adventure of a lifetime, but there are so many other",
          "Herds of Wildebeest and dazzles of zebra brave the swim across the river. Most make it. Fabulous place to see very large crocodiles and hippos. Make this a stop on your game drive.",
          "You can sit for hours watching the changing scenery, from Cheetah stalking Impala to migration of Wilder beast and Zebra. Lots of lions and cheetahs.",
          "This rover and the migration are highlights. But you have to be patient. We were there for 4 hours with 3 aborted attempts made to see the wildebeest cross. But our patience was rewarded and we finally saw them jump onto the river. It quite an awe inspiring spectacle. Care : it",
          "Very picturesque and undulating river traveling through the Mara reserve to the Serengeti of Tanzania. We were able to see many healthy hippos basking in the sun and some crocodiles too. This is the pathway of the migration of the wildebeest. Unfortunately, the wildebeest",
          "I waited a mighty long time to visit the Mara region in Kenya but man ! It was worth it ! The Mara river is full of life ; noisy , indulgent hippos , even tempered zebra, spindly giraffe and of course the mighty wildebeest . You can wait excessively long to site a crossing ,",
          "He we enjoyed a lot had a small walking safer to see Hippos and Croodiles and Mara Bridge. Hippos in the river and some one just in the sunshines.. crocodiles waiting fo wild beasts....It was Amazing, piece of moment in the life for my family.",
          "Went to Masai Mara and Eagle View base camp. Saw migration - hundreds of wildebeests and zebras. Highly recommended!",
          "Super amazing experience, seeing these creatures run through the river to cross to Mara triangle. My husband and capped off our 2 week honeymoon with a 3 day stay in Kichwa Tembo, and our guide James took us to the point where the river crossing usually takes effect. We waited",
          "I was here before the beginning of the rainy season and approx. 3 weeks later at the beginning of the rains The contrast was amazing The grass is still short enough for the predators to be spotted and the contrast is different esp if you are into photography The animal crossing",
          "The Mara River is of course very famous especially during the migration. And although we had carefully considered the time and viewing options, in this case the animals were not crossing near the Serena Mara so we missed the action but plenty of animals anyway",
          "We had really wished we could see the river crossing part of the migration. But thanks to geopolitics & Tanzanian antics, the migration itself was delayed and rerouted. Nonetheless, it was nice to see crocodiles & hippos sunbathing, and baboons & antelopes furtively drinking",
          "I hadn't really appreciated how much of a lucky chance it is to see a migration river crossing, even in the heart of the migration season. We had a day in the Mara National Reserve where we visited one crossing point that had no herds and lots of crocodiles, next we spent about",
          "Visited in August 2018. Excellent place to sight the wildebeest migration and river crossing. Its an amazing sight. We were lucky to see the river crossing after 3 misses. Its an unforgettable experience.",

          "We were into the game drive vehicles at 7.30 to catch the early morning active phase of the animals. It was a magical day starting a little cool and cloudy, becoming sunny and hot in the afternoon and the usual rainstorm setting in about 4.30 p.m. We got close-up views of:",

          "The Mara River offers outstanding scenery, but the real attraction is the wildlife. The migration crossings are the famous attraction, of course, but even if the migration is missed, there is always amazing things to see. Countless hippos and crocodiles and great birdlife!",
          "We were lucky enough to witness two crossings of around 2000 Zebra . An amazing and truly moving experience to see these magnificent creatures braving a crocodile infested river, with crocodiles literally attacking them as they crossed. It was not until a lioness appeared by",
          "This is the place to be if you want to watch all the predators in action. At any time of the day, you are bound to see hippos snoozing away and crocs sunning themselves.",
          "Great viewing on the river of all the big 7 anytime of the year! I highly recommend a safari drive along the river.",
          "Being in Masai Mara during the great migration is something extraordinary. You see wildebeast everywhere! We didn\u2019t see them crossing the river but we could clearly see the signs left behind. The wildlife in the river is also spectacular! Crocodiles and hippos laying there",
          "We were treated to a most incredible experience at the Mara River. Migration was is full swing so all the predators were active and tolerant of our vehicles. The lions were so close that one of them lifted his leg and urinated on the vehicle tire! The huge crocodiles were",

          "Masai Mara was, without a doubt, the highlight of my safari trip in Kenya. After visiting the Amboseli National Park, I was thrilled to visit a new park, but I must say Masai Mara exceeded my expectations. The landscapes here are amazing, and it made wildlife viewing much more",
          "From hippos to crocodiles to lions you are bound to see lots of wildlife as you traverse the area around the Mara river. Make sure if you are fling out of the Masai Mara that you look out the window to garner some perspective of the river and the surroundings area of lodges and",

          "What a nice national park. You can drive along to see all your favorites animals. Get a good local guide to show you around make sure you are utilizing every minute. There are many side roads, dust and road gets bumpy at times especially when it rains. Planning for anything in",
          "The Mara was a vast expanse of wilderness and animals. The water teemed with Crocodile and Hippos. The only drawback to the National Reserve is the abundance of people, but there is value in sharing it with many as they will take the message home about the value of maintaining",
          "We went to Governor's camp to celebrate our Golden Wedding Anniversary. The Manager and his staff made this the most magical safari that we have been on and our anniversary was wonderful",
          "I have been on a game reserve many years ago, but seeing this in Kenya was an amazing and refreshing experience. It is better to have a guide and proper vehicle to take you in the national reserve. There are so many small roads, you will need a radio in case any unexpected",

          "Great location fantastic animals, a place to see wild animals in their true habitat. To see the wildabeast during migration is truly magnificent",
          "This is the only place to go on safari. Saw all the big five and many more besides. A superb place to visit - just like visiting Disney's Animal Kingdom in real life. Masai village is also worth a visit.",
          "So much to see and do, I could spend days watching the Lion cubs and other animals in the Maasai Mara!",
          "Spectacular, and amazing to visit with something happening all the time.To see all the wildlife is a privilege.",
          "Amazing. Early starts and quiet cold but as it warmed up you could look all day for the animals. I didn't think I would see so many elephants and all with babies. the best was the Hippos and crocodiles Wonderful",

          "Visitors go there to see the migration and it is good to get a first hand view and understanding of the size of the river, the steep banks, the limited accessible points, the intelligent crocodiles in waiting, the leadership of wildebeest in checking out the suitability to cross",
          "Wildebeest migration is a sight to behold. Saw lots of everything bar Rhino who were proving elusive whilst we were there. Didn't detract from the experience though",
          "This was my second visit to the reserve. This time we were able to get \"almost too close\" to many of the animals on the Mara. We even got to watch a group of cheetahs stalk a Zebra family who eventually escaped to live another day. If you are in this area, I highly recommend",
          "Wow! Two perfect days of wildlife viewing - the Big 5 plus many, many more! Our guide, Daniel, was excellent and very knowledgeable (Kensington Tours)",

          "This was the high point of the trip that we had been wanting to do for a long time now. To go to Masai Mara or Serengeti to see the migration across Mara River. Everyone advised us to see the migration from the Kenyan side as the area is smaller and the animal density much more",
          "Every inch of the Maasai Mara is unbelievably beautiful! The animals are spectacular and they did not disappoint!",
          "Unforgettable experience for us. Seeing the animals at such close quarters was so nice. The ostriches, wildebeasts, zebras,etc all were seen at such close quarters. Lifetime experience",
          "Watching the wild animals from a very short distance - what can be more thrilling! The Lion King heroes in the flesh!",
          "Watching hundreds of wildebeest plunge in to the Mara river in search of greener grass, in the afternoon of 04/09 was undoubtedly a surreal moment for me and the adrenaline rush still rides high. We were lucky to witness a second crossing the following afternoon albeit smaller",
          "Went here to see a crossing saw two different crossings with a loin kill as the wildebeest exited the river also saw a crocodile kill a baby wildebeest AMAZING",
          "This is a great place to see hippos both in and out of the water, countless crocs everywhere. We watched zebras crossing and they were successful. Very beautiful area.",

          "I love rivers in general. And the Mara River embodies the essence of it all - giving life and exuding beauty. We visited the Maasai Mara and stayed right at the Mara River during the great migration season. Due to weather changes, river crossings did not take place as often as",

          "We saw lions, elephants, giraffes, hyenas, gazelles, hippos, impalas, wildebeests\u2019 just to name a few of the many animals we saw. A highlight, was that were right up close to observe a pride of lions devouring a wildebeest that they killed. I was impressed with the wide variety",
          "I had booked a 5 days trip with baboon team with Masai Mara, Naivasha, Nakuru and had a chance to see all the big five and migration as well. Many thanks to Mr. Dennis, Mr. Albert and specially our driver and host- Mr. Gipson. It was a real fun trip and very well coordinated",
          "The suspense, the action, the drama, all unfolding in front of you in one day. I cannot really explain how that feeling is other than saying that you have to experience it for yourself. I did and I loved every minute of it. Seeing the Lions mate and others eat their hunt, seeing",
          "We got to witness the experience the wildebeest scramble to cross the Mara river . It's wonderful to watch thousands of wildebeest getting together to cross Mara & suddenly the action starts when the lead wildebeest decide to cross & the process is a treat to watch , as they run",
          "The Mara River Bridge is located about 20 km from Serena Safari Lodge or about 60 km from Keekorok. The bridge is about 50m and links two different terrains on the Mara a rocky and hilly terrain towards the keekorok side and flat plains towards the Serena side. The ideal time",
          "The river is at times little more than 10 metres wide yet it is full of wildlife. Hippies are seen in huge numbers and in the pools of this meandering river, it is common to see 50 or so congregated together. On the banks there are groups of crocodile who are clear,y well fed.",
          "The river was fab. Sept is the best time to see every thing. Not too hot. No flies. Seen the migration of the wilderbeast and zebras. Crocodiles every where. Seen lions. Mongoose. Hippos every where. Just loved it all",

          "unfortunately we didn't see the migration, but we had lovely sightings of fat crocodiles and hippos. the crossing site looked quite deadly and I could actually imagine the plight of the wildebeest",
          "We arrived at the end of the wildebeest migration. Groups of animals gathered above the famous river bank deciding whether to chance the crocodiles and hippos. They made a couple of abortive forays and then retreated to the top. I realized most of the 2 dozen vans were there to",
          "travelling here during the migration was a smart idea - we saw so many amazing animals, not just the thousands of wildebeests and zebra. Saw the Big Five several times",
          "Mara River. Beautiful scenery and lovely wildlife supported by river due to vegetation around it. We could see the wielder beast migration across the river. Worth taking this trip. Fantastic experience.",
          "We went to Masai Mara early September 2017 and spent 2 days in the reserve. The river Mara is a nice place full of Kenya fauna. We had the chance to see wildebeests crossing the river. An amazing moment, a bit spoiled by the amount of tourists that were along the river. You can",
          "So many cars and people - to many in some places. Some not behaving in an acceptable way- disturbing the animals. But the wildlife was amazing.",
          "The wildlife around the Mara River in August has to be seen to believe. The plains are filled with thousands of wildebeest and zebras and with a good driver/guide (Ben was amazing) to get you in the right spot the views of the migration crossing the river are truly amazing. We",
          "If you get a chance to visit during the migration you will be amazed at the number of animals, especially the Wildebeest and Zebras! We also saw Lions, Rhinos, Crocs, Elephants, Hippos and lots of Antelope and Deer... as well as Cheetahs!",
          "The animal viewing was so amazing to see so up close and personal. It was great to watch the wildebeests crossing the river. It is something unique to be able to experience these things with your own eyes.",
          "we witnessed the great migration and we could see the leader standing on a small elevated rock and ensuring the complete stock move. we saw a couple lion mating. further down 2 leopards fresh from the kill. Plenty of elephants/giraffee/zebras/wild beest/ Hippos/crocodiles etc.",
          "The Mara river is the home of migration and if you are visiting sometime between May to September beginning you are sure to see the great wild phenomenon that takes place every year. You can also find the Nile crocs and the hippos.",

          "A chance to see some of the world's most incredible animals in their natural, stunning habitat, before the region is potentially transformed by Chinese industrial development",
          "The Masai Mara was always high on my Bucket List \u2705 We were told that only 20% of trips to the Mara river witnessed a crossing with warnings of long 'stake outs'. Hence we were fortunate to see wilderbeest and zebra amass and then cross after only an hour. Meanwhile some crocs",
          "We saw thousands of wildebeests crossing the river! It's really amazing and unforgettable experience in life! It's a pity that we only saw big 3 out of big 5 but it's lucky that we saw the river crossing which is impressive and very true nature.",
          "We saw the wildebeest taking their own time in deciding whether to cross or not and finally when they did, the last one was caught by the next and pulled down the water by the waiting crocodile. River manifested with hippos and crocs. Nice action and surely a place to see nature",
          "To watch the Wildebeest cross the Mara River is an exhausting experience but truly thrilling to see it in real life. If its on your bucket list you really do need to do it - it will not disappoint!!",
          "We took a safari in August visiting the Masai Mara, Lake Nakuru and Amboseli National Reserves. The wildlife in the Mara is the best by a long way - it is also a very different experience from the other Parks. Firstly, the Masai Mara is a long way from a tarmac road - I think",
          "Awesome Kenya safari tour to Maasai Mara Game Reserve, witness the \u201cGreat Migration,\u201d when an estimated 1.5 million wildebeests and zebras trudge across the Masai Mara in seemingly endless herds looking for fresh grass to eat, while being stalked by lions and other predators.",

          "Visiting and sighting of animals at the Mara river was one of a experience. We waited for an hour for the migratory wild beasts to jump and cross the Mara river. It was beautiful sight to see the wild black beasts to jump in the river in numbers. It was worth a visit",
          "Beautiful views!!! Perfect for kids and adults. Hippos, crocodiles, zebras, native birds. They have it all there!",
          "Patience is a virtue if you want to see the Wilderbeast cross the river along with many Zebra. You will notice the 20 or 30 crocs are very patient indeed.",
          "We sat for over an hour watching the wildebeest approaching the river and getting positioned to cross. Once it started, it was well worth the wait. It was sheer bedlam, with all the animals trying to hurry across the river. We were most lucky to have watched the whole thing.",
          "We saw the big five here as well as the great wildebeest migration. Ok - funny story... they wildebeest were not running the river the day we were there, but when we got down to the river (after seeing amazing animal after amazing animal) we look down and spot.... one lonely",
          "Amazing crossings were seen on several occasions to the Mara River. Everyone hopes to see the animals crossing, but it doesn't always happen. I hit right 10 years ago and again this August, both times seeing very large crossing of tens of thousands of animals.",

          "Have always heard about the big migration of the wildebeest and made up my mind to do a safari trip to the Massai Mara. I was a little disappointed because instead of what I have seen in the National Geographic documentaries where hundreds of thousands of wildebeest and zebras",
          "This is an absolute Family must. Be sure to take morning & evening Game drives . All animals are visible in this season. The vastness is awe inspiring, herbivorous & carnivorous are healthy with shiny coat, in plenty. Your Safari is incomplete Safari if You dont VISIT Masai Mara",

          "We had a GREAT guide who got us SO close to the crossing! Way BEYOND any expectations that we had! SO special!",
          "Wonderful Safari. Far exceeded out expectations. The location was amazing. Never thought we'd get this close to the animals. Our guides Senchura and Joseph were knowledgeable, professional and engaging. This was a once in a lifetime trip.",
          "If you are patient, then you will see the crossing during migration. But you have to wait and watch for the animals to go for it",
          "The migration of over 2 million animals was beyond belief! Go in August. Can't say enough about what we saw there.",
          "When the great migration takes place, this is where the animals cross, we missed it by a week, but many of them came to waters edge. Too many crocodiles for them to go into the water",

          "We visited the Masai Mara reserve and Mara River in July for 5 days. We had hoped to see the Great Migration underway and we were not disappointed. For those that have been to reserves in South Africa or more bush reserves, the Masai Mara is completely different. With its open",
          "Mara river is a best place to see the 7th wonders of the world which is the migration of the wildebeests, which occurs annually. my friend if you plan for a safari dont miss Masai Mara for the wildebeests migration.",

          "According to our guide we were lucky. We were fortunate to see a large number of Zebra cross the river followed by 100s of Wildebeest. While we had seen crocs on the shore farther up river, all the wildlife made it across just fine. Lots of wildlife is around including the",
          "part of the your safari shoud include a trip to Mara River where the river crossing occurs during the great migration. If you go there on other times , ( ideally it should be mid August - early Sept). there will be no crossing and you will just see crocodiles and hippos..But",

          "We came to Masai Mara specifically to see the crossing. We were lucky enough to witness 3 separate crossings of various sizes. It's quite interesting to see the wildebeest walk toward the river mostly in single file. Once they arrive they take awhile to decide they want to",

          "July is supposed to be the month of the great migration of the wildebeest from the Serengeti in Tanzania to the Plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya. We were in Kenya for 9 days, two of which were spent in Masai Mara. We saw all the Big Five - lions, Cape Buffalo, Elephants,",
          "The banks are teaming with sunbathing crocodiles and you'll see hippos from 2-30 in shallow pools in the river.. We were also able to see elephant herds come down to the water to play and drink. Just stay a while in one spot and the a different group of animal will appear.",
          "\"The best day of travel ever!\" - that was my comment at the end of the day. Green hills of Africa were dark with thousands of wildebeests, and they were all in rush to line up to cross the Mara river. And the crossing itself, the thousands of animals, crocodiles, wildebeests",
          "Lots and lots of animals and birds! The great migration of wildebeest is a sight to behold! Miles and miles of open savannah with incredible sunrise & sunsets. Hippopotamuses are in the Mara River as well as crocodiles. The crocs take advantage of the Great Migration by nabbing",
          "We saw a major crossing in the Mara river the other day, and it was spectacular! There were many many wildebeests and zebras crossing the river and it's an amazing sight! However patience is required in order to be able to see the crossing. We waited the whole morning, but all",

          "Visiting the National Reserve and its surrounding conservancies probably is the best experience one can have when you love safari. Beautiful sceneries with game all over , and new discoveries behind every other hill and bush. Of course the big five, but there is so much more to",
          "This was the day we'd all been waiting for; would the herd of boring and stupid Gnus make it across the Croc guarded river?If they were cute Gazelles we'd all cheer for them but given the ugly stupidity of the Gnus, we mostly secretly cheered for the crocs. Here are the Gnus",
          "This is one of the coolest experiences to see with all the animals crossing the river. The Great Migration is something you must see in your lifetime. With that said, there are so many people doing the same thing it's hard to go wrong with a tour group. They all have radios to",
          "The wildlife hugs the banks of the Mara River, which is infested with huge crocodiles and hippos. Great place to view monkeys, baboons, elephants, zebra and many many others. A drive along the banks of the river or near known herd crossing areas is a completely different view",
          "We stopped at the river and took a small walk with one of the rangers. It will cost you 10 $ which is reasonable. You can take some nice photos of the hippos and crocodiles. Nice to stretch the legs a bit aswell. The rangers have a lot of knowledge and there good at answering",
          "All the wild life in Masai Mara depends on river Mara, which in itself is full of life. Sitting in the reception area of our lodge, we could see crocodiles, hippos happily floating in its waters. But the crowning of everything about Mara is the river crossing. Big herds of",
          "We drove all the way out to the Mara River to see the herds crossing! It was worth the time and effort.",
          "I think it's worth stopping by to see the families of hippos lazing on the river bank, gigantic crocodiles, vultures feasting on the wildebeest bodies that did not make the river crossing (gross but its life) and not forgetting some baboons. As with everything, a park ranger",
          "terrible mass tourism when whatching the river crossing. Lots of chinese and indian tourists there which trow away a lot of garbage from the safari jeeps (seen with own eyes....)...about 100 Safari Buses where there, when the wildebeast crossed the river mara....",
          "What you see there tells you all about animal survival. Always have patience in safaris as you might not see all you dream of in the first day. With my experience the minimum nights of stay would be three to sight animal activities. I must say that every day (in our 3 day stay)",
          "We came here yesterday on the off chance that the wildebeest migration might happen and after about half an hour of waiting. It did! Can't believe it.",
          "The river area was positively tranquil on the day that I visited even though it was right in the middle of the migration season. Saw an extended family of hippos on the river bank with a number of crocs nearby. Peaceful looking but deadly dangerous!",
          "The wildebeest crossing was amazing. A lifetime experience. The best side is the West side of the river because the photos in the afternoon are not against the sun. So better find a camp on the West side.",
          "The Mara river is as epic as the BBC documentaries make it out to be and some. We went in June - which is supposed to be the best time of the year to see the crossing. But we got unlucky with a drought this year, so the river was quite dry and not as much action.",
          "We visited the site of the great migration crossing the river. It is worth seeing, the sight of the crocs alone was worth the trip.",
          "Take a game drive through the reserve. If you go early take a jumper or something to keep you warm as little cold in morning. Rain doesn't last long in July, as when we went. Please be sure to whisper n order to see max animals and be patient when looking out for them. Going to",
          "Had booked our Safari from Game viewers adventure limited and had seen this river also it is very beautiful river neat and clean with hippo's would love to visit again .",
          "Every time there is something new thrown up by the wild life and nature in Masa Mara. Be it the antics of the little elephant, the lions mating, the failed river crossing and mama wildebeest assisting the young ones to come back up the incline or the cheetahs ready to charge!",
          "Must go once in the life. Freedom is most important thing in the world. The animals in the zoo, no need to worry weather, foods and who will eat you. The animals here, always keep looking for foods and be careful who wants to eat you. Also moving by weather and foods. Where you",
          "The stretch of the Mara river offers quite a diverse experience inn terms of game viewing. While we stayed at a hotel on the river and saw hippos galore, crocodiles and elephants, at another stretch, we saw the wildebeest crossing (June end). Watching the crossing was quite a",

          "It was a great full day spent here in game drive and watching wild animals in a short distance roaming here and there in protected area. A heaven for wild life photographers.",
          "Whether you're here for the annual wildebeest crossing or whether your favorite animal is the hippo or crocodile the Mara River is a must see.",
          "We got lucky every time we were close to the river. Saw a lot of crossings with nile crocs and hippos around, it was all chaotic but a lot of fun. Saw the carcass of a wildebeest being chewed by the crocs and a near fight between a hippo and a giant croc. Breathtaking",

          "Beautiful especially seeing the animals crossing. We missed the great migration river crossing but we hope to come back to this beautiful country again.",
          "Mara River is about 3/4 hrs drive from the gate. The migration which is considered as the 8th wonder only happens few hours during the whole season. One will need a lot of luck to witness it. You can see crocodiles and hippocampus there.",
          "We came for the migration and that's what we got, the amazing spectacle and thousands of wilderbeest. First days the river was low but rains way upriver caused quick flooding and so crossings much harder then. We saw 4 crossings and it was worth the trip to see this wonder",

          "The place where most actions take place during migration. The home of crocodiles and hippos. As the herd approach they hesitate waiting for the first jump.....as soon as one beast crosses then its a stampede as animal after animal tries to cross the river to join with the rest",

        "wiki": "Nairobi () is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. The city lies on the River Athi in the southern part of the country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level.According to the 2019 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 4,397,073 inhabitants lived within 696 km2 (269 sq mi).Home to thousands of Kenyan businesses and over 100 major international companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day.\n\n\n== Nairobi metropolitan region ==\n\nNairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generates about 60% of the entire nation's GDP. The counties are:\n\n Source: NairobiMetro/ Kenya Census\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe site of Nairobi was originally part of an uninhabited swamp. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning \"cool waters\", referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.\n\nIn 1898, Arthur Church was commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets \u2013 Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that \"Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses. The town's early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1908, a further outbreak of the plague led to Europeans concluding that the cause was unhygienic conditions in the Indian Bazaar. The government responded by restricting lower class Indians and African natives to specific quarters for residence and trade setting a precedent for racial segregation in the commercial sphere. By the outset of the First World War, Nairobi was well established as a European settler colony through immigration and land alienation. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade would see a growth in native African communities into Nairobi, where they would go on to constitute a majority for the first time. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:\n\nMaybe one day Nairobi will be laid out with tarred roads, with avenues of flowering trees, flanked by noble buildings; with open spaces and stately squares; a cathedral worthy of faith and country; museums and of art; theatres and public offices. And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done. But until that plan has borne fruit, Nairobi must remain what she was then, a slatternly creature, unfit to queen it over so lovely a country.\nThe continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n\n=== Post Independence ===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.Three years prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its First President.\nThe United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n\nOn 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.On 31 May 2017, The current president Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.\n\n\n=== Historical population data for Nairobi ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is situated at 1\u00b009\u2032S 36\u00b039\u2032E and 1\u00b027\u2032S 37\u00b006\u2032E and occupies 696 square kilometres (270 sq mi).\nNairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county. \n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi). The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F).There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.\n\n\n=== Districts and neighbourhoods ===\n\nNairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. These constituencies are: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed \"Little Mogadishu\".\n\n\n==== Kibera slum ====\n\nThe Kibera slum in Nairobi (with an estimated population of at least 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people) was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nNairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally 150 acres, but has since lost approximately 50 acres of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\n\nThe City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.\nThe Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into \"districts\" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county.\nNairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.\n\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n\nNairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.\nSeveral of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.\nNairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, and Jambo Pay which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca-Cola.Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.\n\n\n=== Central business district and skyline ===\n\nNairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.\nMost of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.\nIn 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.\n\n\n=== Upper Hill ===\n\nTwo areas outside of the Central Business District area that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.\nCompanies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed recently in 2015 and officially opened for business on July 4, 2016. It is a 33-storey tower and reaches a height of 163 meters. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.\nTo accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.\nConstruction boom and real estate development projects\n\nNairobi is undergoing a construction boom. Major real estate projects and skyscrapers are coming up in the city. Among them are:The pinnacle twin towers which will tower at 314 m, Britam Tower (200 m), Avic International Africa headquarters (176 m), Prism tower (140 m), Pan Africa insurance towers, Pallazzo offices, and many other projects. Shopping malls are also being constructed like the recently completed Garden city Mall, Centum's Two rivers Mall, The Hub in Karen, Karen waterfront, Thika Greens, and the recently reconstructed Westgate Mall. High-class residential apartments for living are coming up like Le Mac towers, a residential tower in Westlands Nairobi with 23 floors. Avic International is also putting up a total of four residential apartments on Waiyaki way: a 28-level tower, two 24-level towers, and a 25-level tower. Hotel towers are also being erected in the city. Avic International is putting up a 30-level hotel tower of 141 m in the Westlands.  The hotel tower will be operated by Marriot group. Jabavu limited is constructing a 35 floor hotel tower in Upper Hill which will be high over 140 metres in the city skyline. Arcon Group Africa has also announced plans to erect a skyscraper in Upper hill which will have 66 floors and tower over 290 metres, further cementing Upper hill as the preferred metropolis for multinational corporations launching their operations in the Kenyan capital.\nAlso see List of tallest buildings in Kenya\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPopulation of Nairobi between 1906 and 2019\n\nNairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is 4.1% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a 2011 growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nNairobi National Park\nUhuru Park\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKenya National Theatre, and the Kenya National Archives. Art galleries in Nairobi include the Rahimtulla Museum of Modern Art (Ramoma), the Mizizi Arts Centre, and the Nairobi National Museum.\nThere is also the Karen Blixen Museum and the Nairobi National Museum. There is Kuona Art Center for visual artists in Nairobi.\nBy the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other parts of the British Empire, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala \u2013 Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and also merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan.Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is \"The Green City in the Sun\", which is derived from the city's foliage and warm climate. The second is the \"Safari Capital of the World\", which is used due to Nairobi's prominence as a hub for safari tourism.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\n\nKwani? is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.\nIn 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.\nNairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong'o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film 12 Years a Slave during the 86th Academy Awards at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series Sense8 which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDB).\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film Eye in the Sky, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series Money Heist.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to nyama choma which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee's and Burger King which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, Galittos, Steers, PizzaMojo, Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, Nairobi Java House and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. Benga is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of jazz and Luo music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the African Great Lakes. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of soukous music. This genre was originally developed in Kinshasa and Brazzaville. After the political climate in the region deteriorated, many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as Orchestra Super Mazembe moved from Congo to Nairobi and found great success. Virgin records became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several soukous artists.\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the Kenyan hip hop scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region. Successful artists based in Nairobi include Jua Cali, Nonini, Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and Nameless. Popular Record labels include Ogopa DJs, Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, Calif Records and Bornblack Music Group.\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi. Bob Marley's first-ever visit to Africa started in Nairobi. Acts that have performed in Nairobi include Lost Boyz, Wyclef Jean, Shaggy, Akon, Eve, T.O.K, Sean Paul, Wayne Wonder, Alaine, Konshens, Ja Rule, and Morgan Heritage, and Cabo Snoop. Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.\nNairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in Kenya producing DJs as well as producers like Jack Rooster, Euggy, DJ Fita, Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM. Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including Diplo, Major Lazer, Kyau & Albert, Solarity, Ronski Speed, and Boom Jinx.\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations. These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5 As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.Gospel music is also very popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artistes having a great impact in the mostly Christian city. Artistes such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, have a great pull over the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat have great influence over the younger generation. Their concerts are also very popular and they have as much influence as the great secular artistes. The most popular are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.\nMusical group Sauti Sol performed for U.S. President Barack Obama when he was in the city for the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the Moi International Sports Centre in the suburb of Kasarani. The complex was completed in 1987, and was used to host the 1987 All Africa Games. The complex comprises a 60,000 seater stadium, the second largest in the African Great Lakes (after Tanzania's new national stadium), a 5,000 seater gymnasium, and a 2,000 seater aquatics centre.The Nyayo National Stadium is Nairobi's second largest stadium renowned for hosting global rugby event under the \"Safaricom Sevens.\" Completed in 1983, the stadium has a capacity of 30,000. This stadium is primarily used for football. The facility is located close to the Central Business District, which makes it a convenient location for political gatherings.\nNairobi City Stadium is the city's first stadium, and used for club football. Nairobi Gymkhana is the home of the Kenyan cricket team, and was a venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Notable annual events staged in Nairobi include Safari Rally (although it lost its World Rally Championship status in 2003), Safari Sevens rugby union tournament, and Nairobi Marathon.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the city by viewership and participation. This is highlighted by the number of football clubs in the city, including Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia, A.F.C. Leopards, Tusker and Mathare United.\nThere are six golf courses within a 20 km radius of Nairobi. The oldest 18-hole golf course in the city is the Royal Nairobi Golf Club. It was established in 1906 by the British, just seven years after the city was founded. Other notable golf clubs include the Windsor Country Club, Karen Country Club, and Muthaiga Golf Club. The Kenya Open golf tournament, which is part of the European Tour, takes place in Nairobi. The Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi is the centre of horse racing in Kenya.Rugby is also a popular sport in Nairobi with 8 of the 12 top flight clubs based here.\nBasketball is also a popular sport played in the city's srimary, Secondary and college leagues. Many of the city's urban youth are basketball fans and watch the American NBA.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi (Catholic Church), Anglican Church of Kenya (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of East Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Baptist Convention of Kenya (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques including Jamia Mosque.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe majority of schools follow either the Kenyan Curriculum or the British Curriculum. There is also International School of Kenya and Rosslyn Academy, both of which follow the North American Curriculum, Swedish school in N'gong, and the German school in Gigiri.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nNairobi is home to several Universities and Colleges.\n\nThe University of Nairobi is the largest and oldest university in Kenya. It was established in 1956, as part of the University of East Africa, but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.South Eastern Kenya University is a constituent college of the University of Nairobi.\nKenyatta University is situated 16 km (9.9 mi) from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\nStrathmore University started in 1961 as an Advanced Level (UK) Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\nUnited States International University \u2013 Nairobi was originally a branch of the United States International University, but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\nIn 2005, The Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\nThe Catholic University of Eastern Africa located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\nThe Technical University of Kenya (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only Technical University in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by Mwai Kibaki in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies.\nKCA University (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\nThe Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\nPan African Christian University is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\nEast Africa Institute of Certified Studies (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\nCompugoal College\nRiara University on Mbagathi road.\nUmma University is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.Numerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious LAPPSET project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to Kisumu.\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened Madaraka Express operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).Eastleigh Airport is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n\n==== Matatu ====\n\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\nMatatu, which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport. They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. More recently, some have even painted Barack Obama's face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\nHowever, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\n\nNairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\nThe new Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n\n==== Private car population projection for Nairobi ====\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\n94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses \u2013 technically called non-revenue water \u2013 are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThere is wide variety regarding standards of living in Nairobi. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, and the unavailability of loans for low income earners.Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning \"forest\" or \"jungle\"). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being The Constant Gardener.\nOther notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Historically, British occupiers have settled in Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.\nTo accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is Greenpark, at Athi River, Machakos County 25 km (16 mi) from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.\n\n\n== Crime and law enforcement ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Nairobi had struggled with rising crime, earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname \"Nairobbery,\" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998, the US Embassy was bombed, killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001, the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world, classifying the city as \"status C\". In the United Nations report, it was stated that in 2001, nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies, burglaries, and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation, with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However, many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption, which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution, most large houses have a watch guard, burglar grills, and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes, however, occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.In 2006, crime decreased in the city, due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this, in 2007, the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then, the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.\nFollowing a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man, with terrorist links, the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.There have been a spate of blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012, where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi, killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012, 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi, near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013, Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.On January 15, 2019, five gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel in Nairobi's Westlands neighborhood. The attack began with a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby, and was followed by gunfire. Terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 21 people. The attack was unexpected, because the area that it took place in is generally understood to be a very safe area. Citizens of many countries were inside the hotel due to Nairobi being East Africa's economic hub.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nNairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the Daily Nation and The Standard. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English.\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi. There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.\nSeveral multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi's city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of The New York Times is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.\n\n\n== The future of Nairobi ==\nNairobi has grown since 1899.

          "I really enjoyed the pictures /paintings within the museum. I felt that the museum overall had a good amount of information to read and history shared.",
          "We squeezed this in at the end of a long, hot day for a museum-lover in our group. It was honestly a decent museum, but we were exhausted. We took advantage of the tour guides at the entrance who gave us an overview of what was there and then we decided what to focus on",
          "To be honest we visited because we had time to kill and I probably wouldn't do it again. I was hoping to learn about the history of Kenya but that isn't included much. We did visit the snake park after and were happy to see that the animals and enclosures looked in good",
          "Nairobi National Museum was both interesting and a disappointment. Simple things like signage are noticeably missing. Any museum, right after the entry, will have a large guide map in the foyer area to guide you to the different rooms and what these contain. This museum doesn\u2019t.",
          "Great way to spend a few hours in the city. It\u2019s a very well set out museum, lots of displays and very informative.",
          "Beautiful Museum, staff and researchers are very knowledgeable and passionate about all the treasures Kenya has to offer Highly recommend the cafe!! Has cute kittens on the patio :D",
          "Visited on several occasions and it never disappoints. There's always something to see or do. A must visit.",
          "It went well, except that the police I met were shady. They tried to extort us for money by asking for our yellow fever cards, when we did not have them, they didn't let us go to the hotel to get them.",
          "Excellent displays of natural history, art, culture . . . gives context to any safari trip or other Kenya visit",
          "An hour on a Sunday morning to fill, then why not. Its not especially packed with exhibits, and seemed to miss in my view great chunks of the countries history - very little mention of the collonial period, no mention of Queen Elizabeth connection ascending to the throne",
          "Visited the Museum and for sure it was worth it, variety of things to do like a visit to the snake park, get to see Kenya's rich culture, history among others. Very informative",
          "We had some time to kill so decided to visit the museum. Was very nicely laid out and had some fascinating exhibits and overall very informative. Well worth a visit",
          "We got a wonderful tour by an intern. This was a great musuem and we spent 2 hours here and could have stayed longer. Highly recommended. The restaurant was nasty and would not give us the wifi password to get an uber. Had to take the taxi out front at 5 times the cost.",
          "It\u2019s a place a person visiting Kenya must go to. It\u2019s enriched with very good information about Kenya\u2019s history with the snake park awesome too",
          "You get a guide for the museum who was quite knowledgeable although a bit hard to understand. A good review of the area history and flora and fauna.",
          "We visited this museum during our one-day stay at Nairobi. It was relatively easy to reach the site using Uber. The museum is not a big one but does have a lot of collections. The exhibits provided an overview of Kenya, nature, animals and people. Very nice.",
          "Interesting place to visit to learn a little about Kenyan history and culture, The museum is not huge and can be covered in a couple of hours - well worth a trip though",
          "$15 for the museum and snake park which was a great deal. We did the snake park first.., our guide was knowledgeable and patient. For the museum we opted to explore it alone, and we still enjoyed it. I\u2019d recommend visiting while in Nairobi",
          "Very informative museum full of wonderful history. We walked about 20 minutes from Best Western in the city center. It was a nice short walk through a big local street. Not dangerous at all, I was looking forward to exploring the city.",
          "We have visited this museum during the day, so it is great runaway from hot weather ;] It is really informative, you get to see the traditions, living and even some of the animals in here. We have taken it together with snake park, so it was an enjoying time.",
          "The National Museum is one of several sights on Museum Hill: go through the main gate, and there is the museum itself, the Snake Park, and the Nairobi Botanic Gardens. You can buy a ticket for just the museum, or a combined ticket for the museum and the snake park. We settled",
          "Nice place to visit in Nairobi and learn more of it history and biodiversity. The entrance cost 1200 chellins = 12 US dollars. You need at least 2h to visit it because is a big museum. People is kind and the please is secure. To go there you can use Uber, is the best and safe",
          "Thanks to Erick our guide. Very interesting museum, we enjoyed a lot the animals and the information and material about cradle of humanity",
          "Interesting place to visit to understand Kenya history and the steps to independance. It's also very good to show human history from millions years. Short and great visit",
          "I came on Saturday morning, it was an amazing experience, walking round the museum solo in the morning, nothing but trap music and history.. The art exhibition is cool but the pieces are expensive in comparison...",
          "Some parts of the museum need refreshing but it is an interesting introduction to Kenya. I liked the exhibitions on the evolution of homo sapiens; the life cycles and the history of Nairobi. The small exhibition on money/currency was much better than expected",
          "With all of my friends gone back to the States, I enjoyed and lovely morning here. Got in before the rush and throughly enjoyed strolling about the facility. The only issue was the areas contaning medicinal plants didn't have identifying tags/lables. Other than that the place",
          "It\u2019s a good place to start to know about what happened in the colonialism , about the country and his wildlife. The museum is very simple but it\u2019s in good shape. The information is clear. Next to the museum is the Snake park, that i don\u2019t recommend because they have their",
          "Spent New year's day at this museum. Very nice to walk around the museum. Beautiful exhibits. We took a lovely guide.",
          "Highly educative with verious history era to read and see nice to take kids to understand kenyan rich culture",
          "Very amazing space with lots of things to learn about the history and tradition of kenya.Also,there is a couple of reptiles and therefore you dont miss that moment if you are an animal lover.Very affordable too.",
          "I visited the place on Christmas Day. Lots of stuff to see in the museum. Well arranged, spacious, well documented. Nice gardens, a restaurant and a gift shop within the museum. We didn\u2019t know there were guides. (Quite a number of them which we discovered later) I would have",
          "Yesterday marked my third visit to this place. At the gate is a full-size, metal, brown dinosaur, standing on its hind limbs, its long tail spread on the grass. In the building are lots of history: politics, religion, colonialism, culture, pre-colonial days, the Kenya-Uganda",
          "Me and my wife walked (around 2kms) from our hotel in CBD to the museum on 25th Dec. It was our first day in Kenya, and we were kind of sceptical on the safety etc. (Based on reading several articles)..however the walk turned out to be absolutely ok, and we reached the museum in",
          "The museum is run down and exhibits are not top quality. You will see the old remains of Lucy and others which was pretty interesting. The bird exhibit was nice and as was the tribal part and British rule exhibits. Not your normal museum as it also has a snake and reptile",
          "Very solid museum, not too big, nicely arranged. They also have very knowledgeable guides who enhance the experience.",

          "we met with one of the tour guide called Lame, dude is good, knows his onions and made us enjoy the tour.",
          "The saving grace for this museum are the few prehistoric finds that they have from parts of Northern Kenya. The rest of the exhibits in this museum are passable at best and not terribly engaging.",
          "I visited the museum on a Sunday, spending 2 hours going through the history section (upstairs). I could have easily spent more time, looking closely at the birds, the other natural history section and banking exhibit. The interpretation is pretty good in the Kenya history",
          "This Museum has so much potential and is one of the better ones in the region. It needs a lot of work to make it's information current. The Historia ya Kenya section is one of my favourite sections but some of the photos don't have captions or lack context. It was encouraging to",
          "This museum is dated, but offers a good introduction to Kenyan history and culture. The stuffed birds on display are mind boggling - Kenya has one of the greatest varieties of bird life anywhere.",
          "We had an enjoyable visit at the Nairobi National Museum and especially enjoyed our guide, Peter. He gave us alot of interesting information and answered all of our questions. The tour does try to cover almost every artifact in the museum which is a lot and if we were going to",
          "It was a glad surprise to discover this place that shows many interesting things about the Africa culture and more in depth about Kenya.",
          "The entrance fee included a tour guide. Our guide, Eric, was so knowledgeable and a great resource. It was a 3 hour tour that I really enjoy. After, stopped in the gift shop, a number of good gifts, and prices were reasonable too. I recommend you go",
          "This is an excellent place to visit if you want to learn about Kenya's history, culture, wild life etc. Everything is well explained so you does not really need a guide.",
          "Located on the appropriately named Museum Hill, the imposing building of the Nairobi National Museum with its large, airy galleries and vast campus should be visited \u2013 at least for half a day \u2013 before one embarks on a safari in anyone of the country\u2019s conservancies. Here, one",
          "It is a wonderful place and also you can see how bad think is colonial. You can see the first cags and evolution. If you have time must go there.",

          "Whether you have kids, you're with a partner or (like me) on your own, this is a good way to spend a day in Nairobi and get a bit of culture at the same time. The museum is comprehensive - covering natural history, political history and the anthropology of Kenya. The snake park",
          "We weren\u2019t staying too far from here so we took a walk there. We were joined along the way by a local, David. He wasn\u2019t too obtrusive, he said \u2018he was going the same way\u2019 but did ask if we could buy him some rice at the end of the walk. We did have a good chat though. The",

          "This museum gave us a good foundation for our visit to Kenya. Visitors can go through the exhibits on their own, but we highly recommend taking a guided tour. Our guide, Kelvin Mambo, a University tourism student, called our attention to important exhibits we might have passed",
          "I would give about 4 hours if you want to see the gardens and the snakes also. The artifacts are a little \"tired\" and dusty, but still interesting. There are fossils that Leaky found there. We enjoyed walking around the gardens, but didn't have time to do it all. The",
          "We had seen so many amazing sights by that time our cups were running over! A brisk walk from the Fairmont Norfolk. They will send security with you if you ask, and meet you later at an agreed upon time \ud83d\ude0a. The bird exhibit was cool and enjoyed the snake exhibit even though I am",
          "So far, in the Museum we got to learn about the cultures and tribes of Kenya, the tools, the ancient civilization and evolution of human race, birds, fishes, big five etc. We opted for a guide since we wanted to know more about the Kenyan cultures and British rulings before the",
          "We paid 1500 shillings each for the combined ticket via credit card. Since the display write-ups are in English, we skipped using a guide. The write-ups about the early \"human\" skulls was interesting as well as the room on human evaluation. Did not know that there were so",
          "The museum was a simple, no thrills experience overall. However, the one thing that made the museum a great place to visit was the one room with early human remains. Note that there are casts of these in the larger room, but on the side of the room that traces the evolution of",
          "Location is smack middle of a part of town with heavy traffic. Entry fee is not cheap as well. The only items worth seeing according to me were the displays of the excavations of pre historic remains done by the Leakeys and others.",
          "In our 17 day of kenya this was one of the highlights for me and certainly a delight for me even though I was stick for time. The museum is enormous and like all things in kenya underfunded etc but packed with exhibits. I was caught for time and thus asked out guide to",
          "The enchantment with this museum depends on why you go. If you're there for the early man exhibits, you'll be pleased. If you don't care for taxidermied birds, there are places to avoid. It's not huge, but what exhibits are there are pretty good. The grounds are nice as well,",
          "It was a nice stop with our tour group. It was off by itself but was a nice change to stop and see the museum.",
          "Kind of vintage type of museum, which we all miss from the childhood, but really amazing place. Not overcrowded and you need minimum 2-3 hours around. Kids will love it as well. We bought combined ticket for snake park and it was worth it. The bar around has pretty good food,",
          "I was given a private tour of the Museum, although it was really good, it was too fast, there was hardly any time to look at the exhibits. The guide at the Snake Park was a bit more slow and took more time to explain the details of each reptile and making sure I could see the",

          "I went for Nairobi Design Week event which was disappointing but visited the museum instead and was pleasantly surprised to find some very informative displays on mammals, the Kenyan life cycle and colonialism to independence journey. It\u2019s not a cutting edge museum and feels a",
          "Spent our last full day visiting here and the Snake Park. Even though it was the last day of the school term and there were many school trips, the children\u2019s noise and chatter was offset by their delight in talking English to us! We felt like royalty! The museum is well laid out",
          "We were very pleased with our time at this museum. Students studying at the university are available as free tour guides ( although a tip at the end is appropriate and welcomed). The museum is well designed and and easy to navigatet and I would encourage everyone to make",
          "I was looking forward to a visit to the museum, and judging by reviews, it seems worth visiting. I called on the day to see if March 19 was a good day to visit and I was assured that it was. Only to get there and find out that it had been closed for the past 3 days! It is",
          "Had a great time at the National Museum. Lots of local artifacts and prehistoric items. A very good place to take your children, with kid-oriented features to keep them interested.",
          "This museum has a a fantastic collection of artifacts, stories and things to goggle at. Whether it be wildlife and evolution you are interested in or traditional customs and rites of passage - this is the centre for it all. We had an excellent guide, Jeff, and he gave us a",
          "The Nairobi museum is a must see if you are on your first visit to the city! The entrance fee is reasonable and the displays are well laid out and informative. The early man section is absolutely amazing! The animals of Kenya exhibit was also truly wonderful to see! There is a",

          "I liked the natural history exhibition and the snake park. It was pretty informative as a kenyan i learned new things about culture of other tribes in Kenya. the snake park was not as scary as i had expected. The entrance fee for Kenyans which is good.",
          "This museum is well organised with each section dealing with a special aspect of Kenya's history, nature and culture. There are some large stuffed animals and a large selection of stuffed birds, more that you can count. It is also worth visiting the Snake Park next door. Allow",
          "I visited the National museum and the Snake park for two hours and thought it was well worth the visit. I went for the combo ticket that covers both. There are different list prices for residents and tourists. I was asked if I wanted a guide with me in the museum and I really",
          "The museum is great, with the history of Kenya and the evolution of mankind. You get to learn about the rich history of Kenya and her people. I especially loved the wild animal display in the museum. The wildlife in Kenya is simply spectacular. I loved the Nairobi National",
          "On our last day in Nairobi we visited the museum. I think if we had visited before our safari we would have had a better understanding of all the wildlife in the country. I didn\u2019t know there were so many varieties of birds.",
          "We spent a morning here, both with a museum guide and wondering around on our own. There is a fantastic bird collection and interesting insights into Kenyan culture.",
          "We learned a lot about Nairobi and Kenya history! It was a nice tour about animals and history and different tribes of Kenya. The guide was super nice and she was good to explain and answered all my questions!",
          "Amazing collection showing the evalution of mankind. Excellent Museum guide Rosemary. Would not recommend trying to see all this without a guide.",

          "We enjoyed the museum very much. Many unique and very interesting expositions. Good guides! snake centrum was really good too",
          "Well I have enjoyed my time during my visit, especially the snake section, rest of the exhibits are a bit \"dated\" and needs some refurbishing.",
          "The museum has an excellent section on natural history, including a huge collection of stuffed birds (tho strangely missing some of the most common or beautiful). I found the section on the colonial history of Kenya and the resistance movement that led to independence difficult",
          "Value is not great here, costing $15 for an overall pretty boring museum with an average snake park and anemic botanical garden adjacent. Spend your $15 to get you and 2 friends into the Elephant Orphanage instead",
          "Very good collection of sketches and art work from joy adamson, also an amazing set of pre modern man skulls, skeletons. Bird collection of Africa amazing.",

          "We took a guide (the are there to tell you about everything the museum has to offer) and happy we did it. There is much to see, but not always well explained. But our guide did an excellent job. The museum give you information on Kenya, but much much more. So if you're not into",

          "This is a very good museum right in the middle of Nairobi. The stuff on display was really interesting things. Perhaps the most interesting one is the one about the origin of Homo Sapiens, which was originated in this region. This museum has a very good display about that, which",
          "Its one of the most informative places at Nairobi about Kenya , Culture , Animals and the human race . 1200 kenyan Shillings is cost for Both National Museum and Snake Park which is co-located . My suggestions pl take a guide from the reception though free of cost but they are",
          "A nice place to spend a few hours. The museum is large and at the outset you can opt for a guide if you wish. If not, you a free to wander around freely. The museum wasn't busy when we went and was fairly peaceful. There are numerous rooms over at least two floors containing a",
          "There are 1300 types of birds in Kenya. There is a very good collection at the National Museum and the history of this young nation really becomes to live in the Museum.",

          "With some time to kill in Nairobi, we visited the museum. Fantastic facility. Learned so much, and the displays were very informative. The vast number and types of collections was impressive. The staff were helpful and friendly. I was very pleased to see that the gift shop",
          "Although I did not visit inside of the museum being late at the place, I attended a special programme arranged outside of the museum. We were welcomed by tribal men and women at the entrance and also we could see a nice performance from them. The shop inside the museum is also",
          "I love this museum! The people are friendly and very helpful. My intention was to focus on gourds. But, I received much more. Yes, gourds. Gourds are a part of the life of very Kenyan. And, the museum is working to preserve its seed. I met with a number of departments that are",
          "The museum was a good experience. Everyone was kind and helpful. There were not many people as it was Christmas Day. The exhibits were nice.",

          "My team enjoyed this location. It also has a very large bird sectio, in fact, its one of the largest bird section I have ever seen. It is worth your time to stop by and look inside.",
          "I have been visiting the museum for several occasions and most catching fact for every traveller is its historic finds and preservation, especially the scientific belief of first human on earth, the Turkana Boy, their settlement and development. One can enjoy the great reserve",
          "The guided tour through the hall of mammals, cradle of mankind, art galleries, history of Kenya, life cycles and the many bird species was educative. The most fun part is the snake park where there are life snakes, crocodiles, monitor lizards,tortoise and a beautiful aquarium.",
          "We paid$2 pp to have a guide take us around the museum which was interesting to see the tools and how they lived. the snake park was very sad the enclosure was very minimalist, not natural the snakes were just living.",
          "It was a great visit with kids. Loved the birds collection with sizes starting from a few inches ranging upto few feet. Also the historic collection of Kenya and freedom fight segment is worth visiting",
          "It is a nice opportunity to know more about Africa history specially culture, food, animals and political history. I pretty recommender a guide visit, is more interesting and they can solve all your doubts.",
          "Well-preserved history of Kenya, and interestingly the origin of early 'man'. I loved the life-size animal specimen on display. Friendly staff.",
          "My husband and I visited the musuem last week and we loved it! The bird section was unreal, lots of information on each bird with displays of nests, egss, etc. I saw other reviews that said the museum needed more organization but I felt the notes next to each item were clear and",
          "many rooms to visit, nice place to stay when weather is not good outside it mixes animal museum , kenyan history museum, art museum ... you can easily spend 3 hours inside best is to buy a combo ticket for national museum + snake park (snake park is a 30min visit)",
          "My visit to this location was worth every second spent. The artistic curation were carefully done. The location of this monument is well situated and the staff seemed reluctant to assist, however i thoroughly enjoyed the tour",
          "If you have visited or residing around Nairobi you need to visit the Nairobi National Museum; the snake park, evolutionary histories, ancient skulls and so much more to learn",

          "Lots to see, primary focused on natural history (animals, etc.) and Kenya\u2019s role in human evolution, but also includes informative section on colonial and political history. Safely Walkable from the CBD going via Moi Avenue and Harry Thuku Rd.",
          "It's interesting for Westerners. We came early and were about the only visitors. Added a snake park.",
          "We really enjoyed all the displays at the museum but would have been happy to go just for the bird exhibit. If you are interested to see the array of birds in east Africa, the bird display will give you a great understanding of the enormous variety. There is also a great coffee",
          "The museum is a walking distance from many city hotels. Its rich in history and worthy vising after doing wildlife safaris. Its also connected with snake park for reptiles lovers.",
          "Although a bit more expensive than expected, going to the Nairobi National Museum is a must for anyone visiting the city. One of the most interesting parts is the amazing collection of human fossils, which is rare elsewhere in the world. Learning about the history of Kenya was",
          "Good use of time. Friendly staff. Worth the visit. Opens at 8:30 and there is so much to see. Well worth it",
          "Great museum with many details and pictures. Enjoyed the stamp collection along with the weapons and clothing exhibits. The guides are very knowledgeable. During our visit we were not allowed to take pictures, that was the only drawback. We were later informed that pictures are",
          "I was here for several hours a month ago. Because I had a driver with a set pickup time, I had to estimate how much time I needed, which was 3 hours. I could have spent more time as I wasted a little too much time on the main level looking at the big animal and bird exhibits.",
          "We visited during our stay in Nairobi and enjoyed the museum! You can speed through in 2 hours or you could spend much longer as there\u2019s tons of content. We especially enjoyed the art exhibits. There are guides you can hire at the reception if you want. We purchased the combo",
          "Fascinating Kenyan History. It is all stored and taught to here. Visiting the Kenya National Museum HQ, lets you understand the Kenyan communities cultural heritage and the way there past generations used to live and the means of livelihood",
          "Not miss the \"Turkana boy\" and the incredible collection of birds. You can combine with the next snakes exhibition.",
          "The overall trip to the museum was ok. The highlight was the snake pit. The handler got out 1 for me to hold (shakes ) that was fun",
          "We'd recommend the National Museum if you have a couple of hours to kill after visiting all the top rated attractions in Nairobi. The exterior is very attractive but the interior needs to be updated. The guide that we were assigned basically told us what was written by each",
          "The museum itself is compartmentalised into different sections people can either browse through the collection on their own or pay for a guided tour. The guided tour might be a great option if you are to visit the place as a group. It houses a vast collection of Birds and",
          "I had not been to the NNM for years. Went back with my kids and found the place renovated. Although a lot of the stuff I'd seen as a child are still present, I felt that the modernisation robbed the place the nostalgic feel I had always associated with this museum. Some of the",
          "This is a great place to visit, it was very interesting to learn about the history of Kenya and to see the animal exhibits. Make sure to also visit the snake park.",
          "This is still a favorite place to visit. The exhibits are good and we had a lot of fun. Make sure to visit the snake park for those who like them. A good day spent there",
          "This is certainly a great place to visit just like any major museum in a major city. While I love the mix of natural and historical exhibits on display, I think it's time for a sprucing up, re-imaging, integration of modern-day technologies to bring the place up to date and to",
          "Since we had just come off a safari, we were not too keen to see more giraffes and elephants so we chose three attractions in Nairobi to fill up our waiting time for our late night flight home. We chose the National Museum, Kazuri Bead Factory and Karen Blixen Museum. One thing",
          "Now this is something else! Think animals, think political history, think art, think the history of mankind! It\u2019s all there! The exhibition on the archeological finds is most impressive. Why didn\u2019t I come here as a pupil? I finally got to meet homo erectus!",
          "It was good to learn Kenya's history, and see the different species of birds and wildlife ... great for families... easy tour around museum , not heavy with information . You can go at your own pace",
          "We loved our day at the museum! We expected to stay 2 hours and stayed the entire day. They have a wonderful large permanent bird exhibit of East African birds and the history of Kenya permanent exhibit is also excellent. We learned so much. Great gift shops and restaurant.",
          "There was so much to see. The cafe on site was great too. The reptile and aquarium displays were excellent. I wish I would have had more time to spend in all the exhibits. I would love to visit again next time I\u2019m in Nairobi.",
          "don't be put off by the nay sayers - this is a good collection. I especially enjoyed the bird section and the history of Kenya - in particular the history of independence. the snakes I could take or leave, mainly because we had most of them living under my parents house in",
          "There is a nice exhibit on the tribes of Kenya, and early history up through present. There is also an exhibit on early man, and the bond of a boy found to be about 1.9 million years old. Upstairs there are paintings by Joy Adamson of Born Free fame.",
          "We visited on our first day in Nairobi. You have the option for a guide, which we took. (just tip at the end) This was an incredible introduction to Eastern Africa. The cradle of mankind, the animals, 1300+ birds. It was so helpful for us to see the different types of animals",
          "Really loved visiting here. I gave myself 2 hours but you need more to browse. Loads of information to read. Snake park ok(ish) but very sad to see some snakes in small enclosures with nothing but leaves. The museum is well worth a visit as not much else to do in Nairobii where",
          "Don't forget to visit this museum and learn about the history of this beautiful country. You can understand much more about the Kenya's history, people, culture, tradition or art being there. My son was so excited to see the artifacts from the men evolution, and it is true that",
          "The section on human evolution was quite good but the rest save for the skeleton of a very large elephant was a bit of a let down. I was also disappointed that we were given a guide despite not wanting or requesting one.",
          "the museum is well located and easy to find. it has a rich story of man's and Kenya's early years and gives detailed explanations at each attraction. there is also a snake park that is teaming with different types of snakes and reptiles.",
          "This museum was very interesting and well laid out. Exhibits were well lit and descriptive placards were easy to read and provided excellent information and background for each item on display.",
          "Having a few hours free, I decided to visit the museum and good decision it was. Other than a very extensive display of the local fauna, I found of high interest the displays of the prehistoric human remains. Also enlighting the show of tribal parafernalia and the explanations",
          "We were reccomended to visit the Nairobi National Museum by a staff member at Kwhaze Bed and Breakfast (great place to stay!) and have to say that the museum took us by surprise it was way above any expectations we had. We spent half a day wandering the many rooms of amazing",
          "The Leaky section was very interesting. The snake/reptile part was not worth the extra cost. Easy to get to on your own with a taxi or Uber.",
          "The place is quite small and running down. Some good animal collection but other than that not really worth visiting.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the museum. Unfortunately, we ran out of time and couldn\u2019t see everything we wanted to. The bird collection was vast and I learned a lot about Kenya and the Kenyan people by walking through the museum. Would recommend especially if you are visiting and",
          "I had nothing to do on a Sunday and this was nearby and I'm glad I visited. A nice mix of Kenya natural history and recent history. Fairly small - you can pretty much see everything in under an hour. I particularly loved the sculptures on the grounds.",
          "My wife and I choose to spend a few afternoon hours visiting this museum but we could have spend even more. It is filled with a most amazing collection of items and historical information concerning Kenya and its historical and natural environment. Well worth the visit!",
          "Some of the exhibitions are a little old but they are all very interesting and cover many different areas of Kenyan life. A museum that is well worth a visit even if you are not usually interested in museums.",
          "Very informative exhibits. Extensive information on Africa, Kenya, its flora and fauna, and of course, early human development.",
          "Very nice introduction about Kenyan history. Kids enjoyed the Animals and Birds section. We did not do the snake park.",
          "Nairobi National Museum is a nice introduction to Kenya. There are two main sections; natural history and history and traditions in Kenya. Even the price is quite steep for the foreigners (13 $, 15 $ with the snake park). I recommend a visit. Also worth it is a visit to the",
          "If you want to get a good taste of Kenya history and culture, then this is one of the places to visit. We asked for a tour guide to bring us through and she was most knowledgeable all the areas of the museum. It seemed well kept and laid out nicely from one place to another.",
          "For anyone who wants to know more about Kenya and Kenyan history, I recommend a visit to the museum. We visited with our children and they found the sections talking about different animals, birds and fishes to be fun and educational. That is not to say that adults wouldn't",
          "Looks like this museum has seen better times. It\u2019s dusty and dirty inside and on my visit, some of the exposition areas have been closed. The cafe next to the museum is a good and quiet place. All together, it was not worth the money.",
          "The Museum is worth a trip - I spent an educational 3 hours there. Several of the halls are looking tired with poor lighting and faded exhibits. However, there are also some excellent sections such as the \"Dawn of Man\" and a good section documenting the last few hundred years of",
          "Kenya is a place of rich culture and a deep history that goes back to the origins of humanity itself, around lake Turkana and the Rift Valley. This museum is a good introduction to that rich history, all the way to the horrors of colonialism (concentration camps) and of the",
          "Very well done museum, not the dusty spot it used to be. Examples of the many, many birds endemic to Kenya. Good display of history of Kenya\u2019s independence, including banking system, etc. and old photos. Also, a thorough display of native crafts from several years ago. Also,",
          "A must visit if you are in Nairobi And you like History and nature. Not a massive venue but packed with good interesting exhibits , reasonably priced for Both venues. The museum is very interesting with lots of history and animal exhibits. The snake farm also has plenty of",
          "The museum is not state of the art, but it is full of historical and interesting material. I have been half a dozen times over 5 - 6 years, and always recommend it to friends who travel to Nairobi. Great, really great for kids.",
          "We were fortunate that when we paid our entrance a young man named Nehemiah asked if we wanted a tour guide. We requested this service and he provided an incredible overview history of all the displays. What would have been a static viewing of displays took on a new and",
          "Yes, include this venue on a visit to Nairobi. We were within walking distance of it and had no expectations, but thoroughly enjoyed the displays. The museum does need sprucing up and some of the displays are tired. But don't pass up the opportunity to learn of Kenyan culture",
          "This museum may not seem particularly large to ardent museum frequenters, but it is a thrilling visit, nonetheless. The museum offers a comprehensive, informative explanation and exhibition of the history of Kenya; opening with the ornithological exhibit - this one in particular",
          "Takes around two hours to see both Museum and snake park. We found it very interesting as it shows a lot from the history of Kenya, Nairobi and it\u2019s animals. You can spend a long time here so try not to plan it as a brief visit. At least 2-2.5hrs. It was pretty unreal to see",
          "When I asked the driver how long I should leave for the museum he said, \"some take 30 minutes. Some take 2 hours.\" I took 2 hours. It's not a large museum, but it's filled with a lot of interesting things about the history of Kenya, Africa and the origin of man. I'm not one for",

          "We enjoyed a two hour tour of the museum. We didn\u2019t exoect to have a guide but one was offered and she did add to the tour. It\u2019s an interesting perspective on Kenya\u2019s physical, social and political growth and history. We were glad we visited.",
          "My husband and I visited the Nairobi National Museum and really enjoyed it. There were several different exhibits, from prehistoric human skulls to animals to tribal artifacts and more. We spent about 1.5 hours there and learned lots about Kenya's history- both the people and",
          "It was amazing. It was big and had a lot of interesting things. I really loved it. You get to see the history of humans and the history of Kenya as well. It also had a section of all animals and facts around them. It was very interesting and i recommend you visit.",
          "Not quite New York's Museum of Natural History but very informative and full of quality displays. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The museum's vast collection of animals (taxidermy) was astounding. Just the bird section was humongous, and you could spend almost half an hour there itself. The sections about humans and culture (including real ancient tools that they used) were very interesting and",
          "The museum offered guided Tour planed according to interests and the short time we had, due to driver waiting. Gide are free of charge but accept tips\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe The museum has a great historical exibition and also all vild game animals. There is a snakke park too. Cafe with food clean",
          "One of the greatest outcomes of the exhibition were the birds collection. Another interesting part was the habits and decorations of the different tribes. As always for me, the history was interesting.",
          "I liked going to the Nairobi museum, as it gave good insight and info on African animals, as well as the evolution of humans. It reminded me of a smaller Natural History Museum. I, personally, found the snake park way more interesting. There was a huge variety of reptiles, and",
          "They are keeping their history safe. It is always good to explore the old days. Plenty of knowledge for the young students. It was an amazing experience visiting this place. Staff was very cooperative and helpful.",
          "The museum is a worthwhile attraction if you are looking for a background in Kenyan history, wildlife and culture. It is absolutely worth having the guide (its also free). The guides are knowledgable interns that can walk you through the museum and add a considerable amount of",
          "The Nairobi National Museum offers a useful overview of the natural history and fauna of Kenya, which is a good thing to do in advance of a safari, in addition to some descriptions of the cultural traditions and political history. It will take about two hours. I don't advise",
          "It's a dump; a dusty dump. The exhibits are shabby, shopworn. The exhibits are entirely without imagination or creativity. \"Pathetic\" is the word that best describes this museum. The stuffed animal exhibits, the Birds of Kenya particularly, are either disgusting or funny,",
          "I was keen to learn more about this fascinating country & it\u2019s history . Whilst the cradle of man exhibition promised much it didn\u2019t really deliver. There appears to be many replica animals and their remains that don\u2019t really offer any deeper insight into the countries history.",
          "Excellent displays showing the origins of man and the story of evolution. Exciting skulls and artefacts going back to the beginning of time",
          "The variety may lack but what you get is worth it. Close contact with the giraffes is an experience you will never get anywhere else, and that I gurantee. Kiss a giraffe literally anywhere you tell me",
          "Great museum, very conveniently located nearer to Nairobi's central business district, with ample parking and great access to the highway. The museum itself is fairly small and probably needs about 2 hours to complete along with the nearby snake park, located within the same",
          "Although the museum needs some refurbishment, it is a great place if you would like to learn about the country\u2018s history and the culture of all 42 tribes. We spent a lot of time in the History section and Tribes section where there is lots of information on Kenya\u2018s colonization,",
          "We only planned the visit to fill a couple of hours on the last day of our visit to Nairobi, and to be honest didn't have high expectations, but it certainly exceeded our expectations - both adults and kids. You can consider it two museums in one: one dedicated to animals and",
          "This was somewhere I have always wanted to visit. The cradle of mankind exhibit is amazing - the collection of early human skulls and the \u201cTurkana boy\u201d skeleton are incredible dating back millions of years. The skeleton of Ahmed of Marsabit and his 68kg tusks is phenomenal.",
          "The museum seems to be very old and not taken care of. Also the exhibits are totally not organized and it is difficult to know where to find what. There is a room depicting the colonial history until independence and another room depicting the circle of life from the viewpoint",
          "My wife and I (both late 20s) visited the museum during our one day in Nairobi before heading on safari. There is a restaurant which provided a drink at a reasonable price, and also a gift shop although we did not buy anything. We spent roughly 90 minutes inside the museum and",
          "My best part was the aquarium room. It gave a feeling as though I was right under the water watching the fishes. Quite relaxing.",
          "Its in middle of Nairobi and has lot of information about Kenyan history. Entry fees are different for Kenyans and non-Kenyans",
          "I arrived at the museum concurrently with three bus-loads of schoolchildren. I have to say that the artifacts are small in number and that it is more of a document museum than a cultural museum. The children were loud and it didnt leave much space for any real study of the",
          "A great place to visit, and inexpensive as well. There are a lot of exhibits to see, and most of them are quite modern. The most interesting exhibit is the one which chronicles human evolution and provides the fossils of our past ancestors.",
          "Recommend any traveller in Kenya to spend 1h-2h in this small but nice museum to get a better undertanding of Kenya history, society, flora and fauna. The museum is small but nice, content of the exhibitions well presented and easy to understand. Good experience.",
          "Interesting exhibits showing the various aspects of flora and fauna and economy of Kenya as it evolved.Enjoyable experience !",
          "The exhibitions are perhaps a bit brief and they vary a lot in their topics, but they are very informative and interesting. Especially the one about prehistoric times. Well worth a visit.",
          "Was there a few days ago with my Kenyan wife and stepson, I've seen this in other countries and I'm pretty sure that if Kenyans were to visit the UK and be forced to pay hiked prices for similar places theyd be mighty pissed off. The entrance fee for me as a foregner was a",
          "I'm not really a big fan of museums, but the gardens are very nice and the reptile house is also interesting.",
          "This museum is really well done and it would be easy to spend the better part of a day here. The history of Kenya is told in such an interesting way. And the exhibit on early man is fascinating. I am not a nut for museums at all but this is worth a visit for at least a morning.",
          "An interesting smallish museum that had some unusual artifacts however some updating is called for. There is a large display of very Victorian looking stuffed birds that are in very dusty cases with descriptions that were made a long time ago ( mentions of Tanganyika as a",
          "The exterior decorations were impressive, as were the stained glass windows. The highlights inside the museum were the animal skeletons, the bird collection, and the paintings. There could have been better signage to guide tourists through the various rooms of the museum.",
          "Our first day in Nairobi, we spent a few hours here and it was so worth it! A wonderful introduction to the culture, the history, and the people of Nairobi and all of Kenya. James was our guide, so knowledgeable about everything! He also has a unique perspective from a local",
          "I love going to the museum you ca never get enough of the history of kenya in this place. from culture to modern kenya to history of humanity..",
          "all the most relevant parts of Kenya's history. Museum is very well maintained, peaceful and good organized. Please do not forget to start from left side of the museum :)",
          "Very nice place to get to know Kenya's history under one roof. Educational for kids. They also have a snake park in their premises. A must visit if you are in Kenya.",
          "Some interesting exhibits here but sort of aimed at school education.Several halls devoted to animals,birds,ethnology etc.Optional snake park.",
          "If you want to understand history of Kenya and role of England in their history, you are on right place. The place is very nice, presenting all the most relevant parts of Kenya's history. Museum is very well maintained, peaceful and good organized. Please do not forget to start",
          "We certainly wanted to visit Kenya's national museum before we would leave the country, so we planned it for the last day. We were offered a personal guide and accepted happily. The young woman, a student at the nearby university walked us through all the exhibits and explained",
          "I enjoyed my visit with my friends,learnt alot, took lots of pictures. Beautiful environment. Keep it up!!!!",
          "I do enjoy visiting this museum, the vast range of exhibits and topics covered is impressive. Sadly, and this is not unique to NNM, it's old fashioned displays are tired, dusty, often poorly lit, and the display windows dirty, reflecting, I think, the usual lack of funds",
          "This is a nice museum, on entry I was told to wait and assigned a guide. The chap was pleasant and knowledgeable but I felt rushed around and did not see everything they had on display. There were several large parties of school children so museum was crowded. 3 main exhibit",
          "If you want a little bit of some african/Kenyan historical evidence,this is the place to visit.Come witness some of the Kenyan animal species monkies,lions,cheetahs,snakes and many more.As you walk around viewing there are readily available guides to give you a little bit of",
          "enjoyed with our clients paying a visit to the museum..Had a good experience but for those who get nightmares on seeing snakes,then do'nt do the snake part!",
          "Despite numerous visits, there's alwags something new to learn and admire. It's a rich repository of our history although lacking in some details, it's good for a general overview. The human evolution section is well set out with an awesome ambience while the snake park could",
          "If you're a History Buff, then the Nairobi National Museum is the place to visit. First because of it's close proximity to the Hennessis hotel, a brisk walk should get you there in under 30 minutes. Located in the same premises is the Snake park and the Artcaffe. After browsing",
          "We spent several hours in the museum and enjoyed very much the enormous birds collection and especially the part about mammals and the development of the human species. I have seen better snake parks though, so I recommend rather to spent more time in the museum itself.",
          "The best place to visit in Nairobi city with short time period. It\u2019s highly recommend for family tour also because it can be improved the historical knowledges.",
          "Very good museum giving insight into history, culture and past of Kenya. More eternally worth joining their museum society which gets you free entrance into sights throughout kenya for a reasonable price.",
          "I purchased the non-resident SH 1500 combo ticket which included the Snake House. After checking my bag with umbrella(no charge), I accepted the option of a guided tour (thank you Faith!). The museum tour was at my pace and lasted about 1.5 hours. The Cradle Of Civilization",
          "We entered the museum and did also pay for private tour in the museum. That was really amazing experience to learn about Kenya culture and and get everything explained and nice storytelling as well. The museum is rather big and we spend about 3 hours so see everything + the",
          "A lot of Kenyas history in that museum. You can easyly use a whole day there. Nice guides that know what they talk about.",
          "Lovely museum in the city. The beginnings of Africa, an exhibit of the Tribes of Africa by Joy Adamson, and also some of the artifacts from the Leaky's excavations.",
          "We enjoyed our time at the national museum, particularly the snake exhibition. As museums go, the price was very reasonable at ksh600 per resident for a combined snake and museum ticket. We also found the restaurant to be reasonably priced too. Unfortunately, our time was",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the museum and had a great guide who was able to answer all of the questions that I bombarded him with as some of the cultural exhibits are wonderful and it was good to get the whole story of Kenya's past. Also the restaurant is worth a visit -",
          "Well worth the time spent. Amazing displays covering history of Kenya, amazing bird display, amazing animals. Great contemporary art. And on top of it all a real experience walking from the city centre and dodging traffic to get there and back!",
          "Initially I didn't want a guide but I'm so happy I had one along. The guide really helps to bring the exhibits to life and saves times as you don't have to read every plaque in the museum. It was also helpful to hear a locals perspective on many of the cultural displays. Don't",
          "The combination ticket costs 1500 Kenyan shilling. This will give you admission to the national museum of Nairobi, art gallery, snake and reptile park and botanical gardens. Don't miss the crocodiles and alligators - close up. A great way to discover a bit more about Kenya, it",
          "We paid Ksh 300 for a taxi to the museum and KSh 1200 for entrance fee. We wandered around the museum for a good hour. The museum could do with a guide path because we almost missed seeing the bird collection. Great place to see all the different cultures and the history of Kenya",
          "The admission fee of around \u20ac10,- would not be so bad, if there was anything at all making it a worthwhile visit! The pre-historic section shows some would-be-interesting artefacts, but gives you almost no information along with them, so you end up looking at stuff without",
          "The museum has seen better days and I don't like seeing stuffed animals. They even have a whole room full of stuffed birds. The section on some of the tribes was the most interesting part. I gained a lot more information from visiting the National Archives and the National",
          "When purchasing your tickets, you have the option to include the snake park with your visit to the museum. We opted for the former. The visit was about 1.5 hours in length. The museum captures Kenya\u2019s history - the good and the bad. It was interesting to read how far Kenya has",
          "Well, nothing best like strolling into the museum on foot from the city center on a sunday afternoon, you will love the old smell vintage in the museum while your kids enjoy the snake park and aquarium, worth every coin !!",
          "We spendet wonderful hours here. A lot information in the museum about the past of Kenya and the animals living here. Learning about the culture and tradition. A guided tour with lot more information I would give as a tip. The snake park is also included with a combined",
          "The museum is a bit run down but definitely worth a visit. There is something that everyone will enjoy from a room full of stuffed birds to a room full of stuffed safari animals. There is also an exhibit on \"early man\" fossils from Lake Turkana (discovered by the Leakey family)",
          "Spent a couple of hours at this wonderful museum, excellent presentations of human history, wildlife, indigenous culture. Highly recommend it, and it is a relatively short walk from the city.",
          "Has something for adults and kids. The snake park a b day the aquarium are a hit with the little ones, while the museum areas may interest adult visitors.",
          "The British removed much of anything of value from Kenya before the gained their independence. It showed in the lack of exhibits. However, the museum does try to make the best of what I does have. The extent of the bird section is impressive and well worth a visit there. Some",
          "We had a private guide for the 2-story museum. Nice overview of the history, animals and a huge collection of the birds of East Africa. A bit old fashioned, but worth visiting. Takes about 90 minutes",
          "We visited this attraction when visiting Kenya recently. I must say that ,by and large we went in order to'kill' a morning as it was said to be a must do when in Nairobi. Overall, it was ok for that purpose but in relation to other so called 'national museums' it all seemed",
          "This museum is done the way we did museums in the 50s. Lots of stuff with little or no explanation. The mixture of history and art and natural history and the snake center can at best be called exotic... The snake center which is part of the same ticket is a sad sad experience",
          "Included this museum to the last day of our trip in Nairobi. Only spent about 1 hour here mainly to see the pre historic artefacts. Could be better in terms of offering more exhibits for tourists.",
          "We visited this attraction whilst in Kenya and bought a double ticket for 1500 Kenyan shillings. What annoyed us to start with was that the local population paid a very small fraction of the price and we felt this unfair as this sort of discrimination is not applied in most",
          "Well worth a visit - rooms full of stuffed birds, animals of Kenya, artifacts and an amazing room of Skelton\u2019s and skulls over a million years old.",
          "Visited 2 weeks ago. Fascinating displays particularly the origins of human. Amazing displaynof the bird life of Kenya. Also not to be missed is the Independence struggle for Kenya against the Colonial rulers. I was also privileged to be able to see the wedding photos of a",
          "Rural culture and past traditions are quickly visible here. The artefacts are decent but its a small museum. They can surely do better to give an experience of aspects of the culture like music and food. An easy quick visit is fine if you have the time",
          "There are exhibits at the museum that are 1.6 million years old. To tour the total museum and snake park is probably a days experience. Unfortunately we were on a tight schedule.",
          "Interesting content! Especially the anthropological section (homo evolution)! Visitors need more than one hour to look around despite what we have been told in ticket office. Snake park is also nice and worth a visit but cages should be cleaned at some point.The price for",
          "We enjoyed spending a couple hours here but it could use some sprucing up. There are some interesting historical exhibits discussing Kenyan independence and the rebellion of the Mau Mau. There is some contemporary art and some examples of the natural history of the country.",
          "January, 11/2018, I had to deposit my small backpack at the reception. When I went back to my hotel, late in the afternoon, I've checked all my documents, brochures, invoices, expenses, etc ....... and ........surprise !! 200 Euros have disappeared !! I've no doubts, the",
          "You can get round the whole museum in a couple of hours. We didn't have time to visit the Snake Park which is part of it, but I heard it's good.",
          "There is a lot to see from animals to tribal history in Kenya but the most interesting part was the archaeological section where you could learn about Lucy and the other ancestors of humans. A good guide will be able to make the experience more rewarding. This is a bit of an old",
          "Good exhibits that are pretty self explanatory but guides a personal touch that is quite useful. Mix of old and new (some galleries around). Food at the on-site restaurant was good and fairly priced (for a tourist attraction). Botanical garden is small but the grounds around",
          "A real recommendation if you have some hours to while away in Nairobi. There are the rift valley finds of early man kind, which is outstanding. There are some disturbing stuffed animals but also some gallery space for art. There is also a small cafe if you need refreshment.",
          "The museum has a variety of historical bones, skulls, animal, birds exhibits mixed with some local history and culture. All presented in an old style fashion and buildings.",
          "Highly recommended particularly the sections on human evolution animals and the history of Kenya. Would recommend combining with a ticket to the Snake Park in the same complex with particularly friendly guides and excellent range of snakes and reptiles.",
          "The museum is small (you can tour it in 2 hours if you walk slowly) but it's definitely worth a visit. Our favorite part was the section on human evolution which has bones and skeletons thousands of years old that have been found in Kenya. The part on the history of Kenya was",
          "For those who love wildlife, environmental, cultural, and political history about kenya, I think the Nairobi national Museum should be your next destination. The archeological artifacts of the evolution of man, the artwork and the section on the different species of birds",
          "I'm so glad friends recommended going to this museum early in our Kenya experience. It was very helpful in understanding the history and wildlife of Kenya, as well as the anthropological discoveries that have been made in Kenya and Africa as a whole. Some of the exhibits can be",
          "Very well arranged and has a load of things that you can see. It neighbors the snake park so you can also visit. One payment that you make at the museum also allows you to access the snake park.",
          "I loved the exhibit showing the similarities of different types of animals. I had no idea! It showed great examples of adaptations. The bird exhibit was beautiful and striking. We spent an hour and a half in the museum, but easily could have been there for 3-4 hours.",
          "Not much of museum type BUT that one is worth it thanks to diverse permanent exhibition on kenya politics and tribes and temp exhibit of kenyan artists. We really enjoyed our time there. Worth the money!!!",
          "If you are in Nairobi and you want to learn more history about Kenya and Africai in large then this is the place to be. At the museum you can also interact with snakes at the adjacent snake park.",
          "At entrance we start with snake cages. Beautiful snakes, crocodiles and tortoises. Wonderful preservation of ancient archeological discoveries. A must see place.",
          "Nice, quiet museum with great exhibits on the history of Kenya, human fossils and East African birds.",
          "The museum is average. Not much to see, just some Kenya history. You may skip this if you don't have much time in Nairobi.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the National Museum in Nairobi and was happy to see it filled with Kenyans on a weekend instead of just foreign tourists. The addition of a tour guide helped a lot. It was free but tips were expected at the end and I was happy to give one to my guide",
          "We really did enjoy the museum but for non residents I find it a bit too expensive (~10\u20ac), especially since it isn't really in a great condition. So I fear that the revenue is not used to fund the museum, which is disappointing to me. The washrooms are a DISGRACE. What I liked",
          "The museum is worth a visit, with interesting exhibits about the history of Kenya and its animals. We visited prior to going to the Masai Mara and the animal exhibits provided good context for the trip ahead.",
          "Anational museum promises so much but this offers very little in reality. I didn't come out knowing much more about this extraordinary country, the intrigue, the history, the tribal cultures. You are better off finding a knowledgable friend and peppering them with questions over",
          "We were lucky to have a very good guide we saw many many intresting stuff inside, mixed between history, animals, science..ets Highly recommended.",
          "I love this museum. Greatest collection of stuffed birds i have ever seen. If you\u2019re a bird enthusiast then this a great place to view specimens upclose. Other than the rude staff, I always enjoy visiting the museum as much as i can whenever i come to Nairobi.",
          "A great museum that's easy to get round with clearly labelled displays. It covers just about everything you need to know about the country - people, for, history and geography. The wildlife displays in particular are excellent. Behind the museum there is also a small snake park",
          "Visited the Museum and snake park on my final day in Kenya.....although there is plenty of Kenyan history throughout the layout is a little random. Still a good place to stop by if you're passing.",
          "This is not very well laid out and to be honest, a little random. The exhibitions are numbered but not in numerical order which takes a while to pair them up. The content is good and it's a clean place. There are some parts which could do with an upgrade. I'd recommend if it's",
          "We had a guide and within one and a half hour we knew everything about the most important cultural symbols, tribes and Kenyan wildlife. A perfect start for our travels through Kenya.",
          "I hadn't been in a long time. In addition to good collections of flora and fauna and culture and history, they have wonderful art displays and permanent sculptures and photography. Nice cafe and beautiful grounds too!",
          "I love everything about this museum! The personal docent was a particularly nice touch and made me feel very special. The one exhibit I will always rave about to anyone who will listen is the \"Birds Of Kenya\" room. I have never seen such an extensive collection of taxidermied",
          "If you are at all interested in evolution, paleontology, Kenyan history or customs, We would highly recommend a visit of at least two hours. Request a guide. (They are volunteers, who are trained in tourism industry, and who work for tips. )",
          "The orphanage is one pocket friendly and educative treat for the under 10. Super Exciting for the young ones to see quite a good number of animals. The lions feeding time is unforgettable for my 3yr son.",
          "We needed to pass a few hours and thought this would be fun. There is a lot about Kenyan history that I did not know. This place has amazing displays! There is an entire room dedicated to all the different birds of Kenya. This is a great place to go if you love history.",
          "Fantastic place which really opened my eyes to the suffering of these people under colonial rule. It\u2019s a must if you want to learn about Kenya and I would say no trip is complete without it",
          "We only spent a couple of hours here and maybe we would have gotten more out of it if we had a guided tour, however I was a little disappointed with the museum. I don't think it did Kenya any justice and there was probably a lot more they could have included. I also thought the",
          "We visited this museum on our first day in Nairobi and it was a great introduction to Kenya. We had a guided tour (with George) and I would recommend opting for a guide. I think you will get a lot more out of your visit. The displays are a bit tired looking so having a guide to",
          "This is a nice place to begin seeing what Africa is about. They have extensive information about all of the the early human skeleton finds by the Leakey group. They also have extensive collection of the animals and birds found in Africa. There are also other areas devoted to",
          "The National Museum of Kenya is situated on your way to Westlands. There is alot to learn from all kinds of birds in Kenya to the snake park for those willing to learn more about the different snakes. I am not a fan of snakes but i still visited to learn more. The Leakey",

          "I just went to Nairobi National Museum where I met with local group of birdwatchers which meets here every week at 8.45 in the morning. We saw so many species of birds. I'm looking forward to returning because I met so many guides who share my passion for birdwatching.",
          "Take time out to visit the Museum if you have a couple of hours to spare. It is interesting, informative and good fun, to be enjoyed by children and adults. The snake park is also well worth the visit, this can be combined with the entrance fee of the Museum, with staff to",
          "We had a very short visit to NAIROBI National Musuem...and at the end of it we felt like we should have spend a day at this place.The museum is so beautiful planned and maintained...and the collection of stuffed birds took my breath away and of course the exhibits of the old",
          "Very interesting, and had a great tour guide. I learned a lot about the history of Nairobi. The museum was well keep and very organized.",
          "An awesome place of history from the beginning of human kind. Fantastic animal displays, including a mammoth, prehistoric man, and the hugest collection of birds I have ever seen. There are also some amazing art works, and exhibitions by a displaying artist. The day we went it",

          "Naturally good collection of various skeleton / skulls of pre-historic humans etc. It also has an extensive and impressive collection of African birds. One complaint is that foreigners need to pay 6 times higher compare with Keyans! BTW the snake park is very poor with very",
          "The museum is full of fascinating displays. It's huge so allow plenty of time or do it in sections. I found the Masai displays most interesting. And then we visited the Snake House. Well! I hadn't planned on touching them! There was this gorgeous little golden snake wrapped",

          "The Nairobi National Museum is a wonderful place. The gardens are great to walk around and see birds and look at the unique vegetation. The museum has many important artifacts from east Africa and wonderful natural history exhibits.",
          "In addition to the fairly well presented exhibits, with decent English captioning, the grounds are walkable and include a reptile park (extra fee), where you may have a chance to hold leopard tortoises, a chameleon and baby python. Three craft shops offer decently priced items.",
          "Signage was excellent for an English speaker. There were a wide range of birds from Kenya, and some mammals. There was a display about the evolution of the species. The snake exhibit was outside, and we hadn't bought the correct ticket to see the snakes as well as the",

          "The exhibition is mostly presented in quite a boring, old-fashioned way. Our guide could not tell us anything more than what was written on the signs. Apart from a vast collection of Kenya's birds and other wild animals, the most interesting part is about Kenya's history -",

          "If you have time then you can do this. Not much to be seen unless you really are interested in anthropology. There are no proper directions inside the museum so one has to criss cross or miss out on some artefacts. But one can do it in an hour.",
          "Not sure why the ratings jump from Very Good to Average as this Museum is somewhere in between. I went because reviews here said there were original fossils of early hominids but this is not the case. All displayed hominid fossils - including those found in Kenya are only casts.",
          "The National Museum is clearly one of Kenya's most understated assets. In it there is a full record of significant historical events from pre to post colonial history. In addition, there are excellent photographs, artifacts and stuffed animals that make it exciting for children.",

          "The museum has a promising entrance, the charges for the non-resident visitors are quite high , the returns are relatively poor. A lot of the history is just skimmed over, very little mention of the MauMau ( more available on the internet!), the Asian presence and contribution",
          "I went to the museum today and had a really good experience. The exhibition is quite comprehensive and leads you to Kenya's history including the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial periods. Besides, there are many more things to explore on the country's diverse culture and",
          "If you love anthropology or ornithology, this is just the place to go to while in Nairobi. Also, when you arrive ask someone if you can get a tour of the Anthropology Department and if there is someone who can guide you. There is a whole section dedicated to human evolution.",
          "Every year we take our students to visit the museum to go along with our Kenyan culture and history unit. The museum has done a wonderful job showing the history of the migrations, the fight for independence, and the rites of passage. The students also love the animal exhibit",

        "wiki": "Catholic higher education includes universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher education privately run by the Catholic Church, typically by religious institutes. Those tied to the Holy See are specifically called pontifical universities.\nBy definition, Catholic canon law states that \"A Catholic school is understood to be one which is under control of the competent ecclesiastical authority or of a public ecclesiastical juridical person, or one which in a written document is acknowledged as Catholic by the ecclesiastical authority\" (Can. 803). Although some schools are deemed \"Catholic\" because of their identity and a great number of students enrolled are Catholics, it is also stipulated in canon law that \"no school, even if it is in fact Catholic, may bear the title 'Catholic school' except by the consent of the competent ecclesiastical authority\" (Can. 803 \u00a73).\nThe Dominican Order was \"the first order instituted by the Church with an academic mission\", founding studia conventualiacode: lat promoted to code: la  in every convent of the order, and studia generalia at the early European universities such as the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. In Europe, most universities with medieval history were founded as Catholic. Many of them were rescinded to government authourities in the Modern era. Some, however, remained Catholic, while new ones were established alongside the public ones. The Catholic Church is still the largest non-governmental provider of higher education in the world. Many of them are still internationally competitive. According to the census of the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education, the total number of Catholic universities and higher education institutions around the world is 1,358. On the other hand, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops counts it at 1,861. The Catholic religious order with the highest number of universities around the world today is the Society of Jesus with 114.Like other private schools, Catholic universities and colleges are generally nondenominational, in that they accept anyone regardless of religious affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, or civil status, provided the admission or enrollment requirements and legal documents are submitted, and rules and regulations are obeyed for a fruitful life on campus. However, non-Catholics, whether Christian or not, may or may not participate in otherwise required campus activities, particularly those of a religious nature.\n\n\n== Partial list of universities ==\n\n\n=== Albania ===\nCatholic University \"Our Lady of Good Counsel\", Tirana\n\n\n=== Angola ===\nCatholic University of Angola, Luanda\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nAustral University, Buenos Aires\nCatholic University of Santiago del Estero, Santiago del Estero\nPontifical Catholic University of Argentina, Buenos Aires\nSaint Thomas Aquinas University of the North, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica de C\u00f3rdoba, Cordoba\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica de Cuyo, San Juan\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica de La Plata, La Plata\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica de Salta, Salta\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica de Santa Fe, Santa Fe\nUniversidad del Salvador, Buenos Aires\nUniversidad FASTA, Mar del Plata\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nAustralian Catholic University, 7 campuses (nationwide including Sydney)\nCampion College, Toongabbie, near Sydney\nUniversity of Notre Dame Australia, campuses in Fremantle, Sydney, and Broome\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nBenedict XVI Philosophical-Theological University, Heiligenkreuz\nCatholic-Theological Private University Linz, Linz\nCatholic University College of Education Graz, Graz; f.2007\nInternational Theological Institute, Trumau (near Wien)\nPrivate University College of Education of the Diocese of Linz, Linz; f.1968\nUniversity College of Teacher Education Edith Stein, Innsbruck\nUniversity of Innsbruck Faculty of Catholic Theology, Innsbruck\nUniversity of Salzburg Faculty of Catholic Theology, Salzburg\nUniversity of Vienna Faculty of Catholic Theology, Wien\n\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\nNotre Dame University Bangladesh, Dhaka\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nICHEC Brussels Management School (Institut catholique des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales), Woluwe-Saint-Pierre\nInstitut des hautes etudes des communications sociales (IHECS), Brussels\nInstitut libre Marie Haps (ILMH), Ixelles\nInstitut Saint-Luc, Saint-Gilles\nSaint-Louis University, Brussels, (Universit\u00e9 Saint-Louis -

        "wiki": "Mombasa ( mom-BASS-\u0259, also US:  -\u2060BAH-s\u0259) is a coastal city of Kenya along the Indian Ocean. The city is known as the white and blue city in Kenya. It is the country's oldest (circa 900 AD) and second-largest city (after the capital Nairobi), with a population of about 1,208,333 people according to the 2019 census. Its metropolitan region is the second-largest in the country, and has a population of 3,528,940 people.Mombasa is a tourism-based city; it has an extra-large port and an international airport, and is an important regional tourism center. Located on the east coast of Kenya, it also is the home of one of the State House (Kenya), and is considered by some as a second capital in all but name. In 2018 the local government released an edict in which the city was painted white with blue accents and the old town was painted yellow. In Mombasa County and the former Coast Province, Mombasa's situation on the Indian Ocean made it a historical trading center, and it has been controlled by many countries because of its strategic location.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient and medieval ===\nThe founding of Mombasa is associated with two rulers: Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita. According to legend, Mwana Mkisi is the original ancestor of Mombasa's oldest lineages within Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations). Families associated with the Twelve Nations are still considered the original inhabitants of the city. Mwana Mkisi was a queen from the pre-Islamic era, who founded Kongowea, the original urban settlement on Mombasa Island. Importantly, both of these names have linguistic and spiritual connections with Central Africa. \"Mkisi\" is considered the personification of \"ukisi\" which means \"the holy\" in kiKongo. \"Kongowea\" can similarly be interpreted as the Swahili locative of \"kongo\" which denotes the essence of civilizational order in central Africa. These legends can be read as an acknowledgment of the Bantu-speaking origins of the Swahili people. Shehe Mvitaff superseded the dynasty of Mwana Mkisi and established the first permanent stone mosque on Mombasa Island. Mombasa's oldest extant stone mosque, Mnara, was built c. 1300. Shehe Mvita is remembered as a Muslim of great learning and so is connected more directly with the present ideals of Swahili culture that people identify with Mombasa. The ancient history associated with Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita and the founding of an urban settlement on Mombasa Island is still linked to present-day peoples living in Mombasa. The Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations) Swahili lineages recount this ancient history today and are the keepers of local Swahili traditions.Most of the early information on Mombasa comes from Portuguese chroniclers writing in the 16th century.\nThe famous Moroccan scholar and traveller Ibn Battuta visited the area during his travels to the Swahili Coast and made some mention of the city, although he only stayed one night. He noted that the people of Mombasa were Shafi\u2018i Muslims, religious people, trustworthy and righteous. Their mosques are made of wood, expertly built.The exact founding date of the city is unknown, but it has a long history. Kenyan school history books place the founding of Mombasa as 900 A.D. It must have been already a prosperous trading town in the 12th century, as the Arab geographer al-Idrisi mentions it in 1151. The oldest stone mosque in Mombasa, Mnara, was built c. 1300. The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific ogee arch. This suggests that Swahili architecture was an indigenous African product and disproves assertions that non-African Muslims brought stone architecture to the Swahili Coast.During the pre-modern period, Mombasa was an important centre for the trade in spices, gold, and ivory. Its trade links reached as far as India and China and oral historians today can still recall this period of local history. Indian history shows that there were trade links between Mombasa and Cholas of South India. Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far reaching Indian Ocean trading networks, its key exports then were ivory, millet, sesamum and coconuts.\nIn the late pre-colonial period (late 19th century), it was the metropolis of a plantation society, which became dependent on slave labour (sources contradict whether the city was ever an important place for exporting slaves) but ivory caravans remained a major source of economic prosperity. Mombasa became the major port city of pre-colonial Kenya in the Middle Ages and was used to trade with other African port cities, the Persian Empire, the Arabian Peninsula, India and China. 16th-century Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa claimed, \"[Mombasa] is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar.\"\n\n\n=== Portuguese domination ===\n\nVasco da Gama was the first known European to visit Mombasa, receiving a chilly reception in 1498. Two years later, the town was sacked by the Portuguese. In 1502, the sultanate became independent from Kilwa Kisiwani and was renamed as Mvita (in Swahili) or Manbasa (Arabic). Portugal attacked the city again in 1528. In 1585, a joint military expedition between the Somalis of Ajuran Empire and the Turks of Ottoman Empire, led by Emir 'Ali Bey, successfully captured Mombasa, and other coastal cities in Southeast Africa from the Portuguese. However, Malindi remained loyal to Portugal. The Zimba overcame the towns of Sena and Tete on the Zambezi, and in 1587 they took Kilwa, killing 3,000 people. At Mombasa, the Zimba slaughtered the Muslim inhabitants, but they were halted at Malindi by the Bantu-speaking Segeju and went home. This stimulated the Portuguese to take over Mombasa a third time in 1589, and four years later they built Fort Jesus to administer the region. Between Lake Malawi and the Zambezi mouth, Kalonga Mzura made an alliance with the Portuguese in 1608 and fielded 4,000 warriors to help defeat their rival Zimba, who were led by chief Lundi.\nAfter the building of Fort Jesus Mombasa was put by the Portuguese under the rule of members of the ruling family of Malindi. In 1631 Dom Jeronimo the ruler of Mombasa slaughtered the Portuguese garrison in the city and defeated the relief force sent by the Portuguese. In 1632 Dom Jeronimo left Mombasa and became a pirate. That year the Portuguese returned and established direct rule over Mombasa.\n\n\n=== Omani rule ===\n\nWith the capture of Fort Jesus in 1698, the town came under the influence of the Imamate of Oman, subordinate to the Omani rulers on the island of Unguja, prompting regular local rebellions. Oman appointed three consecutive Governors (Wali in Arabic, Liwali in Swahili):\n\n12 December 1698 \u2013 December 1698: Imam Sa'if ibn Sultan\nDecember 1698 \u2013 1728: Nasr ibn Abdallah al-Mazru'i\n1728\u201312 March 1728: Shaykh RumbaMombasa was briefly returned to Portuguese rule by captain-major \u00c1lvaro Caetano de Melo Castro (12 March 1728 \u2013 21 September 1729), then four new Omani Liwali until 1746, when the last of them made it independent again (disputed by Oman), as the first of its recorded Sultans:\n\n1746\u20131755: 'Ali ibn Uthman al-Mazru'i\n1755\u20131773: Masud ibn Nasr al-Mazru'i\n1773\u20131782: Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mazru'i\n1782\u20131811: Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Mazru'i (born 17\u2013died 1814)\n1812\u20131823: 'Abdallah ibn Ahmad al-Mazru'i (died 1823)\n1823\u20131826: Sulayman ibn 'Ali al-Mazru'i\nFrom 9 February 1824 to 25 July 1826, there was a British protectorate over Mombasa, represented by governors. Omani rule was restored in 1826; seven liwalis where appointed. On 24 June 1837, it was nominally annexed by Said bin Sultan of Muscat and Oman.\n\n\n=== British rule ===\nOn 25 May 1887 Mombasa was relinquished to the British East Africa Association, later the Imperial British East Africa Company. It came under British administration in 1895.\nIt soon became the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate and the sea terminal of the Uganda Railway, construction of which was started in 1896. Many workers were brought in from British India to build the railway, and the city's fortunes revived. The Sultan of Zanzibar formally presented the town to the British in 1898.\nMombasa became the capital of the Protectorate of Kenya, sometime between 1887 and around 1906. The capital was later moved because medical officers warned that the ground was swampy, and urged Sir James Hayes Sadler, then Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate, to plead with London to move the town elsewhere to mitigate potential disease. Nairobi has since been Kenya's capital to date.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBeing a coastal town, Mombasa is characterised by a flat topography. The town of Mombasa is centred on Mombasa Island, but extends to the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by two creeks, Port Reitz in the south and Tudor Creek in the north.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMombasa has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: As). The amount of rainfall essentially depends on the season. The rainiest months are April and May, while rainfall is minimal between January and February.\nLocated near the equator, Mombasa has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.8\u201333.7 \u00b0C (83.8\u201392.7 \u00b0F).\nAs a seaport, Mombasa is subject to detrimental consequences of a fluctuating climate. In October 2006, Mombasa experienced a large flood that affected 60,000 people.Coastal erosion has become a problem for Mombasa infrastructure. Due to rising sea levels, the coastline has been eroding at 2.5\u201320 cm (0.98\u20137.87 in) per year. This has increased the number of annual floods.\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\nMombasa is located on Mombasa Island and sprawls to the surrounding mainlands. The island is separated from the mainland by two creeks: Tudor Creek and Kilindini Harbour. It is connected to the mainland to the north by the Nyali Bridge, to the south by the Likoni Ferry, and to the west by the Makupa Causeway, alongside which runs the Kenya-Uganda Railway.

It has numerous beach front hotels in the area known as the \"North Coast\". Nyali has two distinct sections \u2013 the upmarket Old Nyali and the upcoming New Nyali. For many residents, Nyali has now become a self-contained residential area, with two Nakumatts, a multiplex cinema, shopping malls, banks, schools and post offices. This often eliminates the need for residents to cross the bridge and to go into the congested Mombasa city centre. Nyali is home for the Nyali Cinemax complex, Mamba Village, the Nyali Golf Club, and some of the most prestigious academic institutions of the Coast Province.\nKongowea is a densely populated area with 15 villages, two sub-locations and an estimated population of 106,180 residents.

This fringe community lacks any effective electricity, water or sewer systems, with a general lack of infrastructure. Poverty, lack of sanitation, and unemployment continue to be the greatest issues for the Mikindani Township, which have ensured low health and safety standards for its residents. Poor, lower class housing is widespread, ranging from simple stone, two-storey structures to mud and earth homes fitted with corrugated iron roofs. Much of the community works outside of the township, within Mombasa Island itself as there is a lack of employment and industry. There are number of small health clinics, shops, and a few public primary schools: Nazarene primary is one school, which is known in particular as being staffed by a revolving volunteer teacher base from Western, and predominately English speaking nations. This small town serves as a link between the city and Moi International Airport.

Mombasa Island itself is not a main attraction, although many people visit the Old Town and Fort Jesus. The Nyali, Bamburi, and Shanzu beaches are located north of the city. The Shelly, Tiwi, and Diani beaches are located south of Mombasa. Several luxury hotels exist on these beaches, while the less expensive hotels are located further away.\nMombasa's northern shoreline is renowned for its vibrant 24-hour entertainment offers, including both family entertainment (water parks, cinemas, bowling, etc.), sports (watersports, mountain biking and gokarting), culinary offers (restaurants offering a wide range of specialties from Kenya, China, Japan, India, Italy, Germany and other countries) and nightlife (bars, pubs, clubs, discoth\u00e8ques, etc.).\nOther local industries include an oil refinery with a capacity of 80,000 barrels (13 ML) a day, and a cement factory capable of producing over 1.1 million tons per year. The major intercontinental undersea telecom cables reach shore next to Mombasa, connecting the African Great Lakes to the rest of the world and supporting a fast-growing call centre business in the area. The estimated real GDP growth for Kenya in 2016 is 5.7-6.0%. This growth will be in response to the construction of a railway system from Nairobi to Mombasa which will aid in trade and transportation between Kenya's two major cities.Mombasa will become a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in which certain industries such as tea, garments, and footwear will be exempt from certain taxes to promote domestic growth. This is in response to the deficiencies in Export Processing Zones (EPZ).The Kenyan Dock Worker's Union is situated in Mombasa and has roughly 5,000 members.President Kenyatta has made it a priority to deepen economic ties with Asia at the onset of his presidency. Japan has played a role in financially sponsoring the expansion of the Mombasa port in phase one and two of the expansion project.At 44%, the rate of youth unemployment in Mombasa is more than double the national average of 21% (2016).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nMoi International Airport serves the city of Mombasa. It is located in Port Reitz area, also known locally as Chaani area on the mainland metropolitan area.

Mombasa is connected to Nairobi by dozens of scheduled flights. \n\n\n=== Train ===\nMombasa currently has a modern railway station on the Mombasa\u2013Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway that replaced the century-old station built by the British. Completed in 2017 and located at Miritini, the Mombasa Terminus station links Mombasa to Nairobi. The station, situated about 20 kilometers from the city center, is accessible through the newly built (2018) highway, being the first phase of the larger Dongo Kundu bypass.

The tuk-tuk\u2014a motor vehicle with three wheels\u2014is widely used as transport around the city and its suburbs. No more than three passengers may be carried. A boda-boda is originally a bicycle taxi but have long since been replaced by motorcycles.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nMombasa's port is the largest in East Africa, with 19 deep water berths with two additional berths nearing completion and two oil terminals. Rail connects the port to the interior. There is little or no scheduled passenger service. International cruise ships frequent the port.\n\n\n==== Ferry ====\n\nThere is no bridge between Mombasa Island and south coast, instead the distance is served by ferries operated by the Kenya Ferry Service from Kilindini and Mtongwe to Likoni in the south coast of Mombasa. The last major accident occurred in 1994 when a ferry serving Mtongwe route sank killing more than 270 people.As a result of increases in more luxurious hotels at the South Coast and a lack of a direct bridge linking the South Coast to Mombasa island, visiting tourists have the option of flying directly from Nairobi into the South Coast airstrip at Ukunda.\nThe Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway is currently (2018) under construction. With a total of three bridges, it will finally connect the mainland to the south coast easing the burden on the ferry services.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe major university in the island is the Technical University of Mombasa.\nThe city has a campus of Kenyatta University.\nOther major university campuses include University of Nairobi-Mombasa campus, Mount Kenya University-Mombasa campus, JKUAT-Mombasa, Mombasa Technical College, Bandari college, Utalii college, and ICS college Mombasa.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\n\nMombasa has places of worship serving needs of the city's diverse communities.

          "First impression of the crocodile area wasn't great, but our guide, David, was incredible. He explained a great deal about the crocs. And let us hold one. He was informative without boring the children. There was tortoises and ostriches there as well. There was an you pay for",

          "Authorities should put the right money for such place. It's such a nice place, but none seem to take care of making it more attractive for people to spend more time here. Management don't seem to care for the footfall. Nice to see crocs and turtles up so close, with nice way",
          "There are a bunch of crocodiles sun-bathing. To make it interesting, the guides give a story as to why they are divided into four different areas - since they fight, and the bigger crocs tend to eat up the smaller ones. Then there are a few ostriches. You could avoid this place",
          "This review is for the restaurant only, as we did not have enough time to visit the crocs or other animals. We had a layover in Nairobi for about 12 hours, and came here for lunch at the suggestion of our car driver, since it was close to the Karen Blixen museum that we had",

          "My husband took our 7 year old and 2 year old for a visit and they had a great time, came back with plenty of stories to tell and were so excited for touching a baby croc. It is a nice place for family and to visit when you are with kids",
          "I took my family there and the kids enjoyed watching this giant lizards just lazing in the sun. The young men that act as guides will use a long stick to touch the crocs and when the crocs hiss at them or snap their jaws, the kids are too excited. Even more interesting is when",

          "Definitely doesn't match up to the Mamba village in Mombasa and therefore i wouldn't consider it a top attraction and \"must\" see place. Its worth a visit all the same as a family outing. The greater Mamba village is quite expansive, lots of fun for families with children's",

          "What a great place for young kids. Our 5 and 8 year old boys were mesmerized by the crocodiles. We hired a guide who explained so much about how they live, mate and hunt. This really brought the visit to life. Strongly recommend a visit, if you have the time.",

          "Went here for lunch due to the proximity of the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage. We were told they had a lunch buffet. The day we were there, there was no buffet (mostly likely because there was only one other couple, and we ran into them at the elephant orphanage). It was off",

          "I went there with my other half and stayed two nights at the tent site and although it looked amazing on the photos the reality (sadly) came nowhere near it. The site is really nice layed out but the maintainance was close to non existing. We were the only guests staying there",

          "Except the (overpriced) restaurant, the place is looking a little tired and sad. It is cool to see crocodiles up close, and learn about them from the guide (no tipping needed), and the lake is pretty enough, but overall they need to invest some of that steep cover back into the",
          "Most of the reviews are correct, so it boils down to what you want out of it, and not raising your expectations to the impossible also. Crocodiles are cold-blooded lizards. Don't expect them to be circus animals. They lay around and are really good at not moving. So this",

          "It is not a crocodile farm. It is like a wildlife foster care center for crocodiles and turtles. Feeding time Sunday 4.00 PM, is a great experience. The limited other animals in the park include a few turtles, a bunch of ostriches and a lone giraffe. Entrance fee is very high",
          "I took my son and 2 of his friends to Mamba Village and they had a great time. I guess for locals it's much cheaper as compared to tourists, but it really is a nice experience for children. Try it!",

          "Lots of crocodiles to see, big and small ok for a visit",
          "Make sure if you go here to go around 4pm, thats because its feeding time at 5pm. Feeding time is the best thing about this place, be aware that this place does stink, and the food is always rotting meat",

          "An ok place, they have about 20,000 crocs on the farm, at least that's what the tour guide said. Feeding times are usually at 5:00 pm everyday, best to go on a Friday though, that's when they feed Big Daddy, a 120yr old croc. You can also sample some croc meat at the restaurant.",
          "This place is unique with all the crocodiles and their habitat that in itself it's worth checking out. Only other place you MAY see something similar may be in Orlando...but of course you wouldn't get the African aspect.",
          "Just a nasty \"attraction\". Who wants to see these magnificent creatures penned up and often surrounded by garbage. As another reviewer said \"stinky\". The only GOOD thing about this place is the huge croc model OUTSIDE!!",
          "Mamba village was an ok attraction. I would only suggest going when you can watch the croc's get fed and watch them jump out of the water. It's only a snack though, so the whole feeding time is less than 30 minutes with only a few pieces of meat. That happens daily at 5pm,",
          "if you enjoy watching hundreds of crocs lazing around then this is the place for you , decent day out in mombasa , you can even have a croc burger if you fancy it , be sure to go in the afternoon ,in time for the feeding for the crocs which was the highlight , around 4ish. give",
          "This place used to be good 10+ years ago. Went there in June and was disppointed to see how far downhill it has gone. The crocodile ponds were filthy. The lure a few years ago was the croc meat they served but this is now more widely available. \"Big Daddy\" remains the main"

She has been featured on CNN's African Voices and the BBC's Africa Business Report. Gikonyo is a Co-founder and the Chief Executive Officer at the Karen Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGikonyo was born on 27 May 1950 in the village of Kiamabara near Karatina town in Nyeri County. She came from a poor family and wore her first shoes at age 13.She attended the Alliance Girls High School. Her first job was at the Kenya Railways and Harbours before she joined the university. She earned 700 Kenyan Shillings a month which was a sizable amount for her considering that her school pocket money was 20 shillings.Her first major medical encounter was when her mother was diagnosed with cancer when Gikonyo was 14 years old. But her biggest inspiration to pursue a medical career came from her elder brother, Dr Wallace Kahugu, because her mother spoke highly of him. \nGikonyo went on to acquire a Bachelor\u2019s degrees in Medicine and Surgery from the University of Nairobi, a Master\u2019s in pediatric cardiology from the same university and a post doctoral fellowship in pediatric cardiology from the University of Minnesota in the USA. In recent times and due to her role as a CEO, she has undertaken an MBA from Daystar University.\n\n\n== Karen Hospital and the Heart Runs ==\nTogether with her husband, Betty Gikonyo raised US$14 million to build the Karen Hospital. Of this, US$8 million came from Kenya Commercial Bank, a loan that the hospital has since repaid. The hospital was constructed between 2003 and March 2006. It had 450 employees as at 2015. The hospital also has satellite branches in Chester House (in Nairobi's city centre), Karatina, Meru, Nyeri, Nakuru, Kitengela and Mombasa. She plans to open a Betty Gikonyo School of Nursing in Ngong.\nAs part of her charity work, Gikonyo co-founded the Heart to Heart foundation, an organisation that raises funds for poor children suffering from heart ailments.\n In 1993, she (together with her husband) pioneered the Heart Runs, annual charity events today known as the Karen Hospital Heart Run (or the Heart to Heart Foundation Run) and the Mater Heart Run. The Mater Heart Run attracted an estimated 60,000 participants in 2015.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe is married to Daniel Gikonyo, a cardiologist, Karen Hospital co-founder and the long-standing personal doctor of Kenya's third president Mwai Kibaki.They met at the University of Nairobi during her second year and were married in June 1974. She is a mother of 3 grownup children (a cardiologist, an epidemiologist and a poet) and is a grandmother to eight. Her third child, a son, was born with a speech and hearing impediment that required multiple surgeries to correct. The surgeries proved successful and he now leads a normal life.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nSilver Star (SS) Presidential Award in 1998\nMoran of the Burning Spear (MBS) Presidential Award in 2008\nCEO Global Limited East Africa Regional Awards -  Most influential Woman (Medical category)\n\n\n== Membership ==\nKenya Medical Association\nKenya Cardiac Society\nKenya Pediatric Association\nKenya Medical Women Association.\nChairperson of Nairobi Health Management Board\nChair of the University of Nairobi Alumni Association\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Karen Hospital\nHeart to Heart Foundation\nMater Heart Run",

        "wiki": "Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual activity in exchange for payment. Prostitution is sometimes described as sexual services, commercial sex or, colloquially, hooking. It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as \"the world's oldest profession\" in the English-speaking world. A person who works in this field is called a prostitute and is a type of sex worker.\nProstitution occurs in a variety of forms, and its legal status varies from country to country (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being an enforced or unenforced crime, to unregulated, to a regulated profession. It is one branch of the sex industry, along with pornography, stripping, and erotic dancing. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is street prostitution.\nThere are about 42 million prostitutes in the world, living all over the world (though most of Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa lacks data, studied countries in that large region rank as top sex tourism destinations). Estimates place the annual revenue generated by prostitution worldwide to be over $100 billion.\nThe majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients.\nThe position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions. Some view prostitution as a form of exploitation of or violence against women, and children, that helps to create a supply of victims for human trafficking. Some critics of prostitution as an institution are supporters of the \"Nordic model\", which decriminalizes the act of selling sex, but makes the purchase of sex illegal. This approach has also been adopted by Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway, and France. Others view sex work as a legitimate occupation, whereby a person trades or exchanges sexual acts for money. Amnesty International is one of the notable groups calling for the decriminalization of prostitution.\n\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n\n\n=== General ===\n\nProstitute is derived from the Latin prostituta. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of \"pro\" meaning \"up front\" or \"forward\" and \"stituere\", defined as \"to offer up for sale\". Another explanation is that prostituta is a composition of pro and statuere (to cause to stand, to station, place erect). A literal translation therefore is: \"to put up front for sale\" or \"to place forward\". The Online Etymology Dictionary states, \"The notion of 'sex for hire' is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one 'exposed to lust' or sex 'indiscriminately offered.'\"The word prostitute was then carried down through various languages to the present-day Western society. Most sex worker activists groups reject the word prostitute and since the late 1970s have used the term sex worker instead. However, sex worker can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sexual nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes.\n\nA variety of terms are used for those who engage in prostitution, some of which distinguish between different types of prostitution or imply a value judgment about them. Common alternatives for prostitute include escort and whore; however, not all professional escorts are prostitutes.\nThe English word whore derives from the Old English word h\u014dra, from the Proto-Germanic *h\u014dr\u014dn (prostitute), which derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *keh\u2082- meaning \"desire\", a root which has also given us Latin c\u0101rus (dear), whence the French cher (dear, expensive) and the Latin c\u0101rit\u0101s (love, charity). Use of the word whore is widely considered pejorative, especially in its modern slang form of ho. In Germany, however, most prostitutes' organizations deliberately use the word Hure (whore) since they feel that prostitute is a bureaucratic term.  Those seeking to remove the social stigma associated with prostitution often promote terminology such as sex worker, commercial sex worker (CSW) or sex trade worker.  Another commonly used word for a prostitute is hooker. Although a popular etymology connects \"hooker\" with Joseph Hooker, a Union general in the American Civil War, the word more likely comes from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the Corlear's Hook area of Manhattan in the 1820s, who came to be referred to as \"hookers\". A streetwalker solicits customers on the streets or in public places, while a call girl makes appointments by phone, or in recent years, through email or the internet.\nCorrectly or not, use of the word prostitute without specifying a sex may commonly be assumed to be female; compound terms such as male prostitution or male escort are therefore often used to identify males.  Those offering services to female customers are commonly known as gigolos; those offering services to male customers are hustlers or rent boys.\n\n\n=== Procuring ===\n\nOrganizers of prostitution may be known as pimps (if male) and madams or Mama-san (if female). More formally, one who is said to practice procuring is a procurer, or procuress.\n\n\n=== Clients ===\n\nClients of prostitutes, most often men by prevalence, are sometimes known as johns or tricks in North America and punters in Britain and Ireland. These slang terms are used among both prostitutes and law enforcement for persons who solicit prostitutes. The term john may have originated from the frequent customer practice of giving one's name as \"John\", a common name in English-speaking countries, in an effort to maintain anonymity. In some places, men who drive around red-light districts for the purpose of soliciting prostitutes are also known as kerb crawlers.\nFemale clients of prostitutes are sometimes referred to as janes or sugar mamas.\n\n\n=== Other meanings ===\nThe word \"prostitution\" can also be used metaphorically to mean debasing oneself or working towards an unworthy cause or \"selling out\". In this sense, \"prostituting oneself\" or \"whoring oneself\" the services or acts performed are typically not sexual.  For instance, in the book The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield says of his brother (\"D.B.\"): \"Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me.\" D.B. is not literally a prostitute; Holden feels that his job writing B-movie screenplays is morally debasing.\nThe prostitution metaphor, \"traditionally used to signify political inconstancy, unreliability, fickleness, a lack of firm values and integrity, and venality, has long been a staple of Russian political rhetoric.\" One of the famous insults of Leon Trotsky made by Vladimir Lenin was calling him a \"political prostitute\". Leon Trotsky used this epithet himself, calling German Social Democracy, at that time \"corrupted by Kautskianism\", a \"political prostitution disguised by theories\". In 1938, he used the same description for the Comintern, saying that the chief aim of the Bonapartist clique of Stalin during the preceding several years \"has consisted in proving to the imperialist 'democracies' its wise conservatism and love for order. For the sake of the longed alliance with imperialist democracies [Stalin] has brought the Comintern to the last stages of political prostitution.\"Besides targeting political figures, the term is used in relation to organizations and even small countries, which \"have no choice but to sell themselves\", because their voice in world affairs is insignificant. In 2007, a Russian caricature depicted the Baltic states as three \"ladies of the night\", \"vying for the attentions of Uncle Sam, since the Russian client has run out of money\".Usage of the \"political prostitute\" moniker is by no means unique to Russian political lexicon, such as when a Huffington Post contributor expressed the opinion that Donald Trump was \"prostituting himself to feed his ego and gain power\" when he ran for President of the United States.Sex work researcher and writer Gail Pheterson writes that these metaphorical usages exist because \"the term \"prostitute\" gradually took on a Christian moralist tradition, as being synonymous with debasement of oneself or of others for the purpose of ill-gotten gains\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Near East ===\n\nIn the Ancient Near East along the Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system there were many shrines and temples or \"houses of heaven\" dedicated to various deities documented by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus in The Histories where sacred prostitution was a common practice. It came to an end when the emperor Constantine in the fourth century AD destroyed the goddess temples and replaced them with Christianity.As early as the 18th century BC, ancient Mesopotamia recognized the need to protect women's property rights. In the Code of Hammurabi, provisions were found that addressed inheritance rights of women, including female prostitutes.\n\n\n=== Ancient Hebrew culture ===\nAccording to Zohar and the Alphabet of Ben Sira, there were four angels of sacred prostitution, who mated with archangel Samael. They were the queens of the demons Lilith, Naamah, Agrat Bat Mahlat and Eisheth Zenunim.[1]\n\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\nBoth women and boys engaged in prostitution in ancient Greece. Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera, the Japanese oiran, and also the Indian tawaif. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as Lais were as famous for their company as their beauty, and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.\n\n\n=== Ancient Rome ===\n\nProstitution in ancient Rome was legal, public, and widespread. A registered prostitute was called a meretrix while the unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves, captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose, sometimes by large-scale \"prostitute farmers\" who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\nAccording to Shia Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned fixed-term marriage\u2014muta'a in Iraq and sigheh in Iran\u2014which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of fixed-term marriage was abrogated and ultimately forbidden by either Muhammad, or one of his successors, Umar. Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden. Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution. and Nikah misyar Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities. She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to differentiate between marriage (nikah) and mut'ah, and states that while nikah is for procreation, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification. According to Zeyno Baran, this kind of temporary marriage provides Shi'ite men with a religiously sanctioned equivalent to prostitution.  According to Elena Andreeva's observation published in 2007, Russian travellers to Iran consider mut'ah to be \"legalized profligacy\" which is indistinguishable from prostitution. Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of iddah in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.\n\nIn the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Kyoto, Edo, and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were courtesans in Japan during the Edo period. The oiran were considered a type of y\u016bjo (\u904a\u5973) \"woman of pleasure\" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tay\u016b (\u592a\u592b) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and an educated wit was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761. Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a \"private agreement\" reached between a woman and a man in a brothel. Yoshiwara has a large number of soaplands that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as toruko-buro, meaning Turkish bath.\nA tawaif was a courtesan who catered to the nobility of the Indian subcontinent, particularly during the era of the Mughal Empire. These courtesans danced, sang, recited poetry and entertained their suitors at mehfils. Like the geisha tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film, and the Urdu literary tradition.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages the definition of a prostitute has been ambiguous, with various secular and canonical organizations defining prostitution in constantly evolving terms. Even though medieval secular authorities created legislation to deal with the phenomenon of prostitution, they rarely attempted to define what a prostitute was because it was deemed unnecessary \"to specify exactly who fell into that [specific] category\" of a prostitute. The first known definition of prostitution was found in Marseille's thirteenth-century statutes, which included a chapter entitled De meretricibus (\"regarding prostitutes\"). The Marseillais designated prostitutes as \"public girls\" who, day and night, received two or more men in their house, and as a woman who \"did business trading [their bodies], within the confine[s] of a brothel.\" A fourteenth-century English tract, Fasciculus Morum, states that the term prostitute (termed 'meretrix' in this document), \"must be applied only to those women who give themselves to anyone and will refuse none, and that for monetary gain\". In general prostitution was not typically a life-time career choice for women. Women usually alternated their career of prostitution with \"petty retailing, and victualing,\" or only occasionally turning to prostitution in times of great financial need. Women who became prostitutes often did not have the familial ties or means to protect themselves from the lure of prostitution, and it has been recorded on several occasions that mothers would be charged with prostituting their own daughters in exchange for extra money.\nMedieval civilians accepted without question the fact of prostitution, it was necessary part of medieval life. Prostitutes subverted the sexual tendencies of male youth, just by existing. With the establishment of prostitution men were less likely to collectively rape honest women of marriageable and re-marriageable age. This is most clearly demonstrated in St. Augustine's claim that \"the removal of the institution would bring lust into all aspects of the world.\" Meaning that without prostitutes to subvert male tendencies, men would go after innocent women instead, thus the prostitutes were actually doing society a favor.\nIn urban societies there was an erroneous view that prostitution was flourishing more in rural regions rather than in cities, however it has been proven that prostitution was more rampant in cities and large towns. Although there were wandering prostitutes in rural areas who worked according to the calendar of fairs, similar to riding a circuit, in which prostitutes stopped by various towns based on what event was going on at the time, most prostitutes remained in cities. Cities tended to draw more prostitutes due to the sheer size of the population and the institutionalization of prostitution in urban areas which made it more rampant in metropolitan regions. Furthermore, in both urban and rural areas of society, women who did not live under the rule of male authority were more likely to be suspected of prostitution than their oppressed counterparts because of the fear of women who did not fit into a stereotypical category outside of marriage or religious life.\nSecular law, like most other aspects of prostitution in the Middle Ages, is difficult to generalize due to the regional variations in attitudes towards prostitution. The global trend of the thirteenth century was toward the development of positive policy on prostitution as laws exiling prostitutes changed towards sumptuary laws and the confinement of prostitutes to red light districts.Sumptuary laws became the regulatory norm for prostitutes and included making courtesans \"wear a shoulder-knot of a particular color as a badge of their calling\" to be able to easily distinguish the prostitute from a respectable woman in society. The color that designated them as prostitutes could vary from different earth tones to yellow, as was usually designated as a color of shame in the Hebrew communities. These laws, however, proved no impediment to wealthier prostitutes because their glamorous appearances were almost indistinguishable from noble women. In the 14th century, London prostitutes were only tolerated when they wore yellow hoods.Although brothels were still present in most cities and urban centers, and could range from private bordelages run by a procuress from her home to public baths and centers established by municipal legislation, the only centers for prostitution legally allowed were the institutionalized and publicly funded brothels. However this did not prevent illegal brothels from thriving. Furthermore, brothels theoretically banned the patronage of married men and clergy also, but it was sporadically enforced and there is evidence of clergymen present in brawls that were documented in brothels. Thus the clergy were at least present in brothels at some point or another. Brothels also settled the \"obsessive fear of the sharing of women\" and solved the issue of \"collective security.\" The lives of prostitutes in brothels were not cloistered like that of nuns and \"only some lived permanently in the streets assigned to them.\" Prostitutes were only allowed to practice their trade in the brothel in which they worked. Brothels were also used to protect prostitutes and their clients through various regulations. For example, the law that \"forbid brothel keepers [from] beat[ing] them.\" However, brothel regulations also hindered prostitutes' lives by forbidding them from having \"lovers other than their customers\" or from having a favored customer.Courts showed the conflicting views on the role of prostitutes in secular law as prostitutes could not inherit property, defend themselves in court, or make accusations in court. However, prostitutes were sometimes called upon as witnesses during trial.\n\n\n=== 16th\u201317th centuries ===\nBy the end of the 15th century attitudes seemed to have begun to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of syphilis in Naples 1494 which later swept across Europe, and which may have originated from the Columbian Exchange, and the prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases from the earlier 13th century, may have been causes of this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague, and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority. Furthermore, outlawing brothel-keeping and prostitution was also used to  \"strengthen the criminal law\" system of the sixteenth-century secular rulers.Canon law defined a prostitute as \"a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements.\" The prostitute was considered a \"whore \u2026 who [was] available for the lust of many men,\" and was most closely associated with promiscuity.The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold: \u201cacceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to repent.\" The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the fourteenth century \"began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil.\" However, prostitutes were to be excluded from the Church as long as they practiced. Around the twelfth century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with Mary Magdalene being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways. Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. 'Magdalene Homes' were particularly popular and peaked especially in the early fourteenth century. Over the course of the Middle Ages, popes and religious communities made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes, with varying success.With the advent of the Protestant Reformation, numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution. In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves by particular signs, sometimes wearing very short hair or no hair at all, or wearing veils in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated in this case the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession. In some cultures, prostitutes were the sole women allowed to sing in public or act in theatrical performances.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nAccording to Dervish Ismail Agha, in the Dell\u00e2kname-i Dilk\u00fc\u015f\u00e2, the Ottoman archives, in the Turkish baths, the masseurs were traditionally young men, who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also worked as sex workers. The Ottoman texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to orgasm, and the details of their sexual practices.\nDuring the British East India Company's rule in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic prostitution in India, where they frequently visited local Indian nautch dancers. As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and miscegenation was despised altogether after the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 19th century, legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation mandating pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. This legislation applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. France, instead of trying to outlaw prostitution began to view prostitution as an evil necessary for society to function. France chose to regulate prostitution, introducing a Morals Brigade onto the streets of Paris.  A similar situation did in fact exist in the Russian Empire; prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels were given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. A major work, Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects, was published by William Acton in 1857, which estimated that\nthe County of London had 80,000 prostitutes and that 1 house in 60 was serving as a brothel. Leo Tolstoy's novel Resurrection describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.\nDuring this period, prostitution was also very prominent in the Barbary Coast, San Francisco as the population was mainly men, due to the influx from the Gold Rush. One of the more successful madams was Belle Cora, who inadvertently got involved in a scandal involving her husband, Charles Cora, shooting US Marshal William H. Richardson. This led to the rise of new statutes against prostitution, gambling and other activities seen as \"immoral\".\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe leading theorists of Communism opposed prostitution. Communist governments often attempted to repress the practice immediately after obtaining power, although it always persisted. In contemporary Communist countries, it remains illegal but is nonetheless common. The economic decline brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to increased prostitution in many current or former Communist countries.Originally, prostitution was widely legal in the United States. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. On the other hand, prostitution generated much national revenue in South Korea, hence the military government encouraged prostitution for the U.S. military.In 1956, the United Kingdom introduced the Sexual Offences Act 1956. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution in the United Kingdom itself, it prohibited such activities as running a brothel. Soliciting was made illegal by the Street Offences Act 1959. These laws were partly repealed, and altered, by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the Policing and Crime Act 2009.\nBeginning in the late 1980s, many states in the US increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. Penalties for felony prostitution vary, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison.\nSex tourism emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and globalization.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, Afghans revived a method of prostituting young boys which is referred to as \"bacha bazi\".Since the break up of the Soviet Union, thousands of eastern European women end up as prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel, and Turkey every year; some enter the profession willingly, but many are tricked, coerced, or kidnapped, and often experience captivity and violence. There are tens of thousands of women from eastern Europe and Asia working as prostitutes in Dubai. Men from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates form a large proportion of the customers.India's devadasi girls are forced by their poor families to dedicate themselves to the Hindu goddess Renuka. The BBC wrote in 2007 that devadasis are \"sanctified prostitutes\".Historically, and currently, church prostitutes exist, and the practice may be legal or illegal, depending on the country, state or province.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nProstitutes' salaries and payments fluctuate according to the economic conditions of their respective countries. Prostitutes who usually have foreign clients, such as business travelers, depend on good foreign economic conditions. Payment may vary according to regulations made by pimps, brothel keepers, madams, and procurers, who usually take a slice out of a prostitute's income. Prices may further depend on demand; popular, high-end prostitutes can earn significant amounts of money (upwards of $5,000 per client), and virgins may receive even higher payments.\n\n\n== Laws ==\n\n\n=== Attitudes ===\n\nRoughly speaking, the possible attitudes are:\n\n\"Prostitution should be tolerated by society\":\ndecriminalization: \"prostitution is labor like any other. Sex industry premises should not be subject to any special regulation or laws\", the current situation in New Zealand; the laws against operating a brothel, pimping and street prostitution are struck down, but prostitution is hardly regulated at all. Proponents of this view often cite instances of government regulation under legalization that they consider intrusive, demeaning, or violent, but feel that criminalization adversely affects sex workers. Amnesty International is one of the notable groups calling for the decriminalization of prostitution.\nregulation: prostitution may be considered a legitimate business; prostitution and the employment of prostitutes are legal, but regulated; the current situation in the Netherlands, Germany, most of Australia and parts of Nevada (see Prostitution in Nevada). The degree of regulation varies very much; for example, in the Netherlands, prostitutes are not required to undergo mandatory health checks (see Prostitution in the Netherlands), while in Nevada, the regulations are very strict (see Prostitution in Nevada).\n\"Prostitution should not be tolerated\":\nabolitionism (prostitution itself is not prohibited, but most associated activities are illegal, in an attempt to make it more difficult to engage in prostitution, prostitution is heavily discouraged and seen as a social problem): prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal, but the surrounding activities such as public solicitation, operating a brothel and other forms of pimping are prohibited. This is to some extent the current situation in Great Britain, where prostitution is considered \"both a public nuisance and sexual offence\", and Italy among others.\nneo-abolitionism (\"prostitution is inherently abusive, both a cause and consequence of inequality, a form of violence against women, a violation of human rights, the clients of the prostitutes exploit the prostitutes\"): prostitutes are not prosecuted, but their clients and pimps are, which is the current situation in Sweden, France, Norway and Iceland (in Norway the law is even more strict, forbidding also having sex with a prostitute abroad).\nprohibitionism (both prostitutes and clients are criminalized and are seen as immoral, they are considered criminals): the prevailing attitude nearly everywhere in the United States, with a few exceptions in some rural Nevada counties (see Prostitution in Nevada)In some countries, there is controversy regarding the laws applicable to sex work. For instance, the legal stance of punishing pimping while keeping sex work legal but \"underground\" and risky is often denounced as hypocritical; opponents suggest either going the full abolition route and criminalize clients or making sex work a regulated business.\n\nMany countries have sex worker advocacy groups which lobby against criminalization and discrimination of prostitutes.\nThese groups generally oppose Nevada-style regulation and oversight, stating that prostitution should be treated like other professions. In the United States of America, one such group is COYOTE (an abbreviation for \"Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics\") and another is the North American Task Force on Prostitution. In Australia the lead sex worker rights organisation is Scarlet Alliance. International prostitutes' rights organizations include the International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights and the Network of Sex Work Projects.Other groups, often with religious backgrounds, focus on offering women a way out of the world of prostitution while not taking a position on the legal question.\nProstitution is a significant issue in feminist thought and activism. Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution can be a valid choice for the women who choose to engage in it; in this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.\nIn February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.\n\n\n=== Legality ===\n\nThe position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions on victimhood and exploitation, inequality, gender roles, gender equality, ethics and morality, freedom of choice, historical social norms, and social costs and benefits.\nLegal themes tend to address four types of issue: victimhood (including potential victimhood), ethics and morality, freedom of choice, and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).\nProstitution may be considered a form of exploitation (e.g., Sweden, Norway, Iceland, where it is illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them \u2014 the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute), a legitimate occupation (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, where prostitution is regulated as a profession) or a crime (e.g., many Muslim countries, where the prostitutes face severe penalties).\nThe legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being legal and considered a profession to being punishable by death. Some jurisdictions outlaw the act of prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money); other countries do not prohibit prostitution itself, but ban the activities typically associated with it (soliciting in a public place, operating a brothel, pimping etc.), making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law; and in a few countries prostitution is legal and regulated.\nIn 1949, the UN General Assembly adopted a convention stating that \"prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person\", requiring all signing parties to punish pimps and brothel owners and operators and to abolish all special treatment or registration of prostitutes. As of January 2009, the convention was ratified by 95 member nations including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and not ratified by another 97 member nations including Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n\n=== Advertising ===\nIn countries where prostitution is legal, advertising it may be legal (as in the Netherlands) or illegal (as in India).\nCovert advertising for prostitution can take a number of forms:\n\nby cards in newsagents' windows\nby cards placed in public telephone enclosures: so-called tart cards\nby euphemistic advertisements in regular magazines and newspapers (for instance, talking of \"massages\" or \"relaxation\")\nin specialist contact magazines\nvia the InternetIn the United States, massage parlors serving as a cover for prostitution may advertise \"full service\", a euphemism for coitus.In Las Vegas, prostitution is often promoted overtly on the Las Vegas Strip by third party workers distributing risque flyers with the pictures and phone numbers of escorts (despite the fact that prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and Clark County, see Prostitution in Nevada).\nThe way in which prostitutes advertise their presence varies widely. Some remain in apartments which have hints or clues outside such as posters with \"model\" written on them to lure potential customers inside. Others advertise by putting numbers or location in phoneboxes or in online or newspaper ads. In more sexually permissive societies, prostitutes can advertise in public view, such as through display windows. In sexually restrictive societies it may occur through word-of-mouth and other means.\n\n\n== Socio-economic issues ==\n\n\n=== Illegal immigration ===\n\nA difficulty facing migrant prostitutes in many developed countries is the illegal residence status of some of these women. They face potential deportation, and so do not have recourse to the law. Hence there are brothels that may not adhere to the usual legal standards intended to safeguard public health and the safety of the workers.\nThe immigration status of the persons who sell sexual services is \u2013 particularly in Western Europe \u2013 a controversial and highly debated political issue. Currently, in most of these countries most prostitutes are immigrants, mainly from Eastern and Central Europe; in Spain and Italy 90% of prostitutes are estimated to be migrants, in Austria 78%, in Switzerland 75%, in Greece 73%, in Norway 70% (according to a 2009 TAMPEP report, Sex Work in Europe-A mapping of the prostitution scene in 25 European countries).\nAn article in Le Monde diplomatique in 1997 stated that 80% of prostitutes in Amsterdam were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.\n\n\n=== Survival sex ===\n\nSurvival sex is when the prostitute is driven to prostitution by a need for basic necessities such as food or shelter. This type of prostitution is common among the homeless and in refugee camps. The term is used in the sex trade and by aid workers, although some practitioners do not regard the act as exploitative.\n\n\n=== Use of children ===\n\nRegarding the prostitution of children the laws on prostitution as well as those on sex with a child apply. If prostitution in general is legal there is usually a minimum age requirement for legal prostitution that is higher than the general age of consent (see above for some examples). Although some countries do not single out patronage of child prostitution as a separate crime, the same act is punishable as sex with an underage person.\nIn India, the federal police say that around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution. A CBI statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimated that about 40% of all India's prostitutes are children.In Bangladesh, child prostitutes are known to take the drug Oradexon, also known as dexamethasone. This over-the-counter steroid, usually used by farmers to fatten cattle, makes child prostitutes look larger and older. Charities say that 90% of prostitutes in the country's legalized brothels use the drug. According to social activists, the steroid can cause diabetes, high blood pressure and is highly addictive.Thailand's Health System Research Institute reported that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand.Some adults travel to other countries to have access to sex with children, which is unavailable in their home country. Cambodia has become a notorious destination for sex with children. Thailand is also a destination for child sex tourism. Several western countries have recently enacted laws with extraterritorial reach, punishing citizens who engage in sex with minors in other countries. As the crime usually goes undiscovered, these laws are rarely enforced.\n\n\n=== Among the elderly ===\nProstitution among the elderly is a phenomenon reported in South Korea where elderly women, called Bacchus Ladies, turn to prostitution out of necessity. They are called that because many also sell the popular Bacchus energy drink to make ends meet. State pensions of about \u20a9200,000 (US$168) provide a basic income but are often not enough to cover the rising medical bills of old age. It first arose after the 1997 Asian financial crisis when it became more difficult for children and grandchildren to support their elders. Clients tend to be more senior. The use of erection inducing injections with reused needles has contributed to the spread of sexually transmitted disease.\n\n\n=== Violence ===\n\nStreet prostitutes are at higher risk of violent crime than brothel prostitutes and bar prostitutes.In the United States, the homicide rate for female prostitutes was estimated to be 204 per 100,000. There are substantial differences in rates of victimization between street prostitutes and indoor prostitutes who work as escorts, call girls, or in brothels and massage parlors. Violence against male prostitutes is less common.Prostitution may sometimes be associated with illegal, abusive, and dangerous activities. One view maintains that this results from prostitution being stigmatized or illegal, or both. Another, however, believes that legalizing and regulating prostitution does not improve the situation, but instead makes it worse, creating a parallel illegal prostitution industry, and failing to dissociate the legal part of the sex trade from crime.\n\n\n=== Sex trafficking ===\n\nSex trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation. The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution (although the study notes that this may be the result of statistical bias and that sex trafficking tends to receive the most attention and be the most visible). Sex trafficking has been described by Kul Gautum, Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF, as \"the largest slave trade in history.\" It is also the fastest growing criminal industry, predicted to outgrow drug trafficking. While there may be a higher number of people involved in slavery today than at any time in history, the proportion of the population is probably the smallest in history.\u201cAnnually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80 percent of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors,\" estimated the US Department of State in a 2008 study, in reference to the number of people estimated to be victims of all forms of human trafficking. Due in part to the illegal and underground nature of sex trafficking, the actual extent of women and children forced into prostitution is unknown. A statistical analysis of various measures of trafficking found that the legal status of prostitution did not have a significant impact on trafficking.Children are sold into the global sex trade every year. Often they are kidnapped or orphaned, and sometimes they are sold by their own families. According to the International Labour Organization, the occurrence is especially common in places such as Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal and India.Globally, forced labour generates an estimated $31 billion, about half of it in the industrialised world and around one tenth in transitional countries, according to the International Labour Organization in a report on forced labour (\"A global alliance against forced labour\", ILO, 11 May 2005). Trafficking in people has been facilitated by factors such as porous borders and advanced communication technologies, and has become increasingly transnational in scope and highly financially lucrative.\nThe most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the US, according to a report by the UNODC (UN Office on Drugs and Crime).Major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Illicit uses ===\n\nProstitution, often when it is illegal, is used in extortion and blackmail, which always involves extortion, where the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. The subject of the extortion may be manipulated into or voluntarily solicit the use of prostitution which is then later used to extort money or for profit otherwise. The film The Godfather Part II famously depicts the role of Senator Geary who is implicated in the use of prostitution in order to gain his compliance on political issues.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Street ===\n\nIn street prostitution, the prostitute solicits customers while waiting at street corners, sometimes called \"the track\" by pimps and prostitutes alike.  They usually dress in skimpy, provocative clothing, regardless of the weather.  Street prostitutes are often called \"streetwalkers\" while their customers are referred to as \"tricks\" or \"johns.\" Servicing the customers is described as \"turning tricks.\" The sex is usually performed in the customer's car, in a nearby alley, or in a rented room.  Motels and hotels that accommodate prostitutes commonly rent rooms by the half or full hour.\nIn Russia and other countries of the former USSR, prostitution takes the form of an open-air market. One prostitute stands by a roadside, and directs cars to a so-called \"tochka\" (usually located in alleyways or carparks), where lines of women are paraded for customers in front of their car headlights. The client selects a prostitute, whom he takes away in his car. Prevalent in the late 1990s, this type of service has been steadily declining in recent years.\nA \"lot lizard\" is a commonly encountered special case of street prostitution. Lot lizards mainly serve those in the trucking industry at truck stops and stopping centers. Prostitutes will often proposition truckers using a CB radio from a vehicle parked in the non-commercial section of a truck stop parking lot, communicating through codes based on commercial driving slang, then join the driver in his truck.\n\n\n=== Window prostitution ===\n\nWindow prostitution is a form of prostitution that is fairly common in the Netherlands and surrounding countries. The prostitute rents a window plus workspace off a window operator for a certain period of time, often per day or part of a day. The prostitute is also independent and recruits her own customers and also negotiates the price and the services to be provided.\n\n\n=== Brothels ===\n\nBrothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution, often confined to special red-light districts in big cities. Other names for brothels include bordello, whorehouse, cathouse, knocking shop, and general houses. Prostitution also occurs in some massage parlours, and in Asian countries in some barber shops where sexual services may be offered as a secondary function of the premises.\n\n\n=== Escorts ===\n\nEscort services may be distinguished from prostitution or other forms of prostitution in that sexual activities are often not explicitly advertised as necessarily included in these services; rather, payment is often noted as being for an escort's time and companionship only, although there is often an implicit assumption that sexual activities are expected.\nIn escort prostitution, the act takes place at the customer's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or in a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (called in-call). The prostitute may be independent or working under the auspices of an escort agency. Services may be advertised over the Internet, in regional publications, or in local telephone listings.\nUse of the Internet by prostitutes and customers is common. A prostitute may use adult boards or create a website of their own with contact details, such as email addresses. Adult contact sites, chats and on-line communities are also used. This, in turn, has brought increased scrutiny from law enforcement, public officials, and activist groups toward online prostitution. In 2009, Craigslist came under fire for its role in facilitating online prostitution, and was sued by some 40 US state attorneys general, local prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.\nReviews of the services of individual prostitutes can often be found at various escort review boards worldwide. These online forums are used to trade information between potential clients, and also by prostitutes to advertise the various services available. Sex workers, in turn, often use online forums of their own to exchange information on clients, particularly to warn others about dangerous clients.\n\n\n=== Sex tourism ===\n\nSex tourism is travel for sexual intercourse with prostitutes or to engage in other sexual activity. The World Tourism Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations defines sex tourism as \"trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside this sector but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with residents at the destination\".As opposed to regular sex tourism, which is often legal, a tourist who has sex with a child prostitute will usually be committing a crime in the host country, under the laws of his own country (notwithstanding him being outside of it) and against international law. Child sex tourism (CST) is defined as a travel to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated child sexual abuse. Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil, and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.\n\n\n=== Virtual sex ===\nVirtual sex, that is, sexual acts conveyed by messages rather than physically, is also the subject of commercial transactions. Commercial phone sex services have been available for decades. The advent of the Internet has made other forms of virtual sex available for money, including computer-mediated cybersex, in which sexual services are provided in text form by way of chat rooms or instant messaging, or audiovisually through a webcam (see camgirl).\n\n\n== Prevalence ==\n\nAccording to the paper \"Estimating the prevalence and career longevity of prostitute women\", the number of full-time equivalent prostitutes in a typical area in the United States (Colorado Springs, CO, during 1970\u20131988) is estimated at 23 per 100,000 population (0.023%), of which some 4% were under 18. The length of these prostitutes' working careers was estimated at a mean of 5 years. According to a 2012 report by Fondation Scelles there are between 40 and 42 million prostitutes in the world.In 2003, it was estimated that in Amsterdam, one woman in 35 was working as a prostitute, compared to one in 300 in London.The number of men who have used a prostitute at least once varies widely from country to country, from an estimated low of between 7% and 8.8% in the United Kingdom, to a high of between 59% and 80% in Cambodia. A study conducted by ProCon \u2013 a nonpartisan nonprofit organization \u2013 estimated the percentage of men who had paid for sex at least once in their lives, and found the highest rates in Cambodia (between 59 and 80% of men had paid for sex at least once) and Thailand (an estimated 75%), followed by Italy (16.7\u201345%), Spain (27\u201339%), Japan (37%), the Netherlands (13.5\u201321.6%), the United States (15.0\u201320.0%), and China (6.4-20%). Nations with higher rates of prostitution clients, or \u201cjohns\u201d, display much more positive attitudes towards commercial sex. In some countries, such as Cambodia and Thailand, sex with prostitutes is considered commonplace and men who do not engage in commercial sex may be considered unusual by their peers. In Thailand, it has been reported that about 75% of men have visited a prostitute at least once in their lifetimes. In Cambodia, that figure is 59% to 80%.In the United States, a 2004 TNS poll reported 15% of all men admitted to having paid for sex at least once in their life. However, a paper entitled \"Prostitution and the sex discrepancy in reported number of sexual partners\" concluded that men's self-reporting of prostitutes as sexual partners provides a serious underestimate.In Australia, a survey conducted in the early 2000s showed that 15.6% of men aged 16\u201359 reported paying for sex at least once in their life, and 1.9% had done so in the past year.Reports disagree on whether prostitution levels are growing or declining in developed countries. Some studies indicate that the percentage of men engaging in commercial sex in the United States has declined significantly in recent decades: in 1964, an estimated 69\u201380% of men had paid for sex at least once. Some have suggested that prostitution levels have fallen in sexually liberal countries, most likely because of the increased availability of non-commercial, non-marital sex or, for example in Sweden, because of stricter legal penalties. Other reports suggest a growth in prostitution levels, for example in the US, where again, sexual liberalisation is suggested as the cause. As Norma Ramos, Executive Director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women says \"The more the commercial sex industry normalizes this behavior, the more of this behavior you get\".Prostitutes have long plied their trades to the military in many cultures.  For example, the British naval port of Portsmouth had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large red-light districts near American military bases in the Philippines. The notorious Patpong entertainment district in Bangkok, Thailand, started as an R&R location for US troops serving in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. Washington D.C. itself had Murder Bay which attracted the military of the Civil War. The village of Vadia, India is known locally as the village of prostitutes, where unmarried women are involved in prostitution. Mass weddings for children of prostitutes in the village are held to protect them from being pushed into prostitution.\n\n\n== Medical situation ==\nIn some places, prostitution may be associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Lack of condom use among prostitutes and their clients has been cited as a factor in the spread of HIV in Asia: \"One of the main reasons for the rapid spread of HIV in Asian countries is the massive transmission among sex workers and clients\".  As a result, prevention campaigns aimed at increasing condom use by sex workers have been attributed to play a major role in restricting the spread of HIV.One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia.\nSome studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population.Typical responses to the problem are:\n\nbanning prostitution completely\nintroducing a system of registration for prostitutes that mandates health checks and other public health measures\neducating prostitutes and their clients to encourage the use of barrier contraception and greater interaction with health careSome think that the first two measures are counter-productive. Banning prostitution tends to drive it underground, making safe sex promotion, treatment and monitoring more difficult. Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Both of the last two measures can be viewed as harm reduction policies.\nIn countries and areas where safer sex precautions are either unavailable or not practiced for cultural reasons, prostitution is an active disease vector for all STDs, including HIV/AIDS, but the encouragement of safer sex practices, combined with regular testing for sexually transmitted diseases, has been very successful when applied consistently. As an example, Thailand's condom program has been largely responsible for the country's progress against the HIV epidemic. It has been estimated that successful implementation of safe sex practices in India \"would drive the [HIV] epidemic to extinction\" while similar measures could achieve a 50% reduction in Botswana. In 2009, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged all countries to remove bans on prostitution and homosexual sex, because \"such laws constitute major barriers to reaching key populations with HIV services\". In 2012, the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, which was convened by Ban Ki-moon, and which is an independent body, established at the request of the UNAIDS, and supported by a Secretariat based at the UNDP, reached the same conclusions, also recommending decriminalization of brothels and procuring. Nevertheless, the report states that:\"The content, analysis, opinions and policy recommendations contained in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations Development Programme.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeckman, Karen (2003).

          "I really enjoyed the pictures /paintings within the museum. I felt that the museum overall had a good amount of information to read and history shared.",
          "We squeezed this in at the end of a long, hot day for a museum-lover in our group. It was honestly a decent museum, but we were exhausted. We took advantage of the tour guides at the entrance who gave us an overview of what was there and then we decided what to focus on",
          "To be honest we visited because we had time to kill and I probably wouldn't do it again. I was hoping to learn about the history of Kenya but that isn't included much. We did visit the snake park after and were happy to see that the animals and enclosures looked in good",
          "Nairobi National Museum was both interesting and a disappointment. Simple things like signage are noticeably missing. Any museum, right after the entry, will have a large guide map in the foyer area to guide you to the different rooms and what these contain. This museum doesn\u2019t.",
          "Great way to spend a few hours in the city. It\u2019s a very well set out museum, lots of displays and very informative.",
          "Beautiful Museum, staff and researchers are very knowledgeable and passionate about all the treasures Kenya has to offer Highly recommend the cafe!! Has cute kittens on the patio :D",
          "Visited on several occasions and it never disappoints. There's always something to see or do. A must visit.",
          "It went well, except that the police I met were shady. They tried to extort us for money by asking for our yellow fever cards, when we did not have them, they didn't let us go to the hotel to get them.",
          "Excellent displays of natural history, art, culture . . . gives context to any safari trip or other Kenya visit",
          "An hour on a Sunday morning to fill, then why not. Its not especially packed with exhibits, and seemed to miss in my view great chunks of the countries history - very little mention of the collonial period, no mention of Queen Elizabeth connection ascending to the throne",
          "Visited the Museum and for sure it was worth it, variety of things to do like a visit to the snake park, get to see Kenya's rich culture, history among others. Very informative",
          "We had some time to kill so decided to visit the museum. Was very nicely laid out and had some fascinating exhibits and overall very informative. Well worth a visit",
          "We got a wonderful tour by an intern. This was a great musuem and we spent 2 hours here and could have stayed longer. Highly recommended. The restaurant was nasty and would not give us the wifi password to get an uber. Had to take the taxi out front at 5 times the cost.",
          "It\u2019s a place a person visiting Kenya must go to. It\u2019s enriched with very good information about Kenya\u2019s history with the snake park awesome too",
          "You get a guide for the museum who was quite knowledgeable although a bit hard to understand. A good review of the area history and flora and fauna.",
          "We visited this museum during our one-day stay at Nairobi. It was relatively easy to reach the site using Uber. The museum is not a big one but does have a lot of collections. The exhibits provided an overview of Kenya, nature, animals and people. Very nice.",
          "Interesting place to visit to learn a little about Kenyan history and culture, The museum is not huge and can be covered in a couple of hours - well worth a trip though",
          "$15 for the museum and snake park which was a great deal. We did the snake park first.., our guide was knowledgeable and patient. For the museum we opted to explore it alone, and we still enjoyed it. I\u2019d recommend visiting while in Nairobi",
          "Very informative museum full of wonderful history. We walked about 20 minutes from Best Western in the city center. It was a nice short walk through a big local street. Not dangerous at all, I was looking forward to exploring the city.",

          "The National Museum is one of several sights on Museum Hill: go through the main gate, and there is the museum itself, the Snake Park, and the Nairobi Botanic Gardens. You can buy a ticket for just the museum, or a combined ticket for the museum and the snake park. We settled",
          "Nice place to visit in Nairobi and learn more of it history and biodiversity. The entrance cost 1200 chellins = 12 US dollars. You need at least 2h to visit it because is a big museum. People is kind and the please is secure. To go there you can use Uber, is the best and safe",
          "Thanks to Erick our guide. Very interesting museum, we enjoyed a lot the animals and the information and material about cradle of humanity",

          "I came on Saturday morning, it was an amazing experience, walking round the museum solo in the morning, nothing but trap music and history.. The art exhibition is cool but the pieces are expensive in comparison...",
          "Some parts of the museum need refreshing but it is an interesting introduction to Kenya. I liked the exhibitions on the evolution of homo sapiens; the life cycles and the history of Nairobi. The small exhibition on money/currency was much better than expected",
          "With all of my friends gone back to the States, I enjoyed and lovely morning here. Got in before the rush and throughly enjoyed strolling about the facility. The only issue was the areas contaning medicinal plants didn't have identifying tags/lables. Other than that the place",
          "It\u2019s a good place to start to know about what happened in the colonialism , about the country and his wildlife. The museum is very simple but it\u2019s in good shape. The information is clear. Next to the museum is the Snake park, that i don\u2019t recommend because they have their",

          "I visited the place on Christmas Day. Lots of stuff to see in the museum. Well arranged, spacious, well documented. Nice gardens, a restaurant and a gift shop within the museum. We didn\u2019t know there were guides. (Quite a number of them which we discovered later) I would have",
          "Yesterday marked my third visit to this place. At the gate is a full-size, metal, brown dinosaur, standing on its hind limbs, its long tail spread on the grass. In the building are lots of history: politics, religion, colonialism, culture, pre-colonial days, the Kenya-Uganda",
          "Me and my wife walked (around 2kms) from our hotel in CBD to the museum on 25th Dec. It was our first day in Kenya, and we were kind of sceptical on the safety etc. (Based on reading several articles)..however the walk turned out to be absolutely ok, and we reached the museum in",
          "The museum is run down and exhibits are not top quality. You will see the old remains of Lucy and others which was pretty interesting. The bird exhibit was nice and as was the tribal part and British rule exhibits. Not your normal museum as it also has a snake and reptile",
          "Very solid museum, not too big, nicely arranged. They also have very knowledgeable guides who enhance the experience.",

          "The saving grace for this museum are the few prehistoric finds that they have from parts of Northern Kenya. The rest of the exhibits in this museum are passable at best and not terribly engaging.",
          "I visited the museum on a Sunday, spending 2 hours going through the history section (upstairs). I could have easily spent more time, looking closely at the birds, the other natural history section and banking exhibit. The interpretation is pretty good in the Kenya history",
          "This Museum has so much potential and is one of the better ones in the region. It needs a lot of work to make it's information current. The Historia ya Kenya section is one of my favourite sections but some of the photos don't have captions or lack context. It was encouraging to",
          "This museum is dated, but offers a good introduction to Kenyan history and culture. The stuffed birds on display are mind boggling - Kenya has one of the greatest varieties of bird life anywhere.",
          "We had an enjoyable visit at the Nairobi National Museum and especially enjoyed our guide, Peter. He gave us alot of interesting information and answered all of our questions. The tour does try to cover almost every artifact in the museum which is a lot and if we were going to",

          "The entrance fee included a tour guide. Our guide, Eric, was so knowledgeable and a great resource. It was a 3 hour tour that I really enjoy. After, stopped in the gift shop, a number of good gifts, and prices were reasonable too. I recommend you go",

          "Located on the appropriately named Museum Hill, the imposing building of the Nairobi National Museum with its large, airy galleries and vast campus should be visited \u2013 at least for half a day \u2013 before one embarks on a safari in anyone of the country\u2019s conservancies. Here, one",

          "Whether you have kids, you're with a partner or (like me) on your own, this is a good way to spend a day in Nairobi and get a bit of culture at the same time. The museum is comprehensive - covering natural history, political history and the anthropology of Kenya. The snake park",
          "We weren\u2019t staying too far from here so we took a walk there. We were joined along the way by a local, David. He wasn\u2019t too obtrusive, he said \u2018he was going the same way\u2019 but did ask if we could buy him some rice at the end of the walk. We did have a good chat though. The",

          "This museum gave us a good foundation for our visit to Kenya. Visitors can go through the exhibits on their own, but we highly recommend taking a guided tour. Our guide, Kelvin Mambo, a University tourism student, called our attention to important exhibits we might have passed",
          "I would give about 4 hours if you want to see the gardens and the snakes also. The artifacts are a little \"tired\" and dusty, but still interesting. There are fossils that Leaky found there. We enjoyed walking around the gardens, but didn't have time to do it all. The",
          "We had seen so many amazing sights by that time our cups were running over! A brisk walk from the Fairmont Norfolk. They will send security with you if you ask, and meet you later at an agreed upon time \ud83d\ude0a. The bird exhibit was cool and enjoyed the snake exhibit even though I am",
          "So far, in the Museum we got to learn about the cultures and tribes of Kenya, the tools, the ancient civilization and evolution of human race, birds, fishes, big five etc. We opted for a guide since we wanted to know more about the Kenyan cultures and British rulings before the",
          "We paid 1500 shillings each for the combined ticket via credit card. Since the display write-ups are in English, we skipped using a guide. The write-ups about the early \"human\" skulls was interesting as well as the room on human evaluation. Did not know that there were so",
          "The museum was a simple, no thrills experience overall. However, the one thing that made the museum a great place to visit was the one room with early human remains. Note that there are casts of these in the larger room, but on the side of the room that traces the evolution of",
          "Location is smack middle of a part of town with heavy traffic. Entry fee is not cheap as well. The only items worth seeing according to me were the displays of the excavations of pre historic remains done by the Leakeys and others.",
          "In our 17 day of kenya this was one of the highlights for me and certainly a delight for me even though I was stick for time. The museum is enormous and like all things in kenya underfunded etc but packed with exhibits. I was caught for time and thus asked out guide to",
          "The enchantment with this museum depends on why you go. If you're there for the early man exhibits, you'll be pleased. If you don't care for taxidermied birds, there are places to avoid. It's not huge, but what exhibits are there are pretty good. The grounds are nice as well,",

          "Kind of vintage type of museum, which we all miss from the childhood, but really amazing place. Not overcrowded and you need minimum 2-3 hours around. Kids will love it as well. We bought combined ticket for snake park and it was worth it. The bar around has pretty good food,",
          "I was given a private tour of the Museum, although it was really good, it was too fast, there was hardly any time to look at the exhibits. The guide at the Snake Park was a bit more slow and took more time to explain the details of each reptile and making sure I could see the",

          "I was looking forward to a visit to the museum, and judging by reviews, it seems worth visiting. I called on the day to see if March 19 was a good day to visit and I was assured that it was. Only to get there and find out that it had been closed for the past 3 days! It is",
          "Had a great time at the National Museum. Lots of local artifacts and prehistoric items. A very good place to take your children, with kid-oriented features to keep them interested.",
          "This museum has a a fantastic collection of artifacts, stories and things to goggle at. Whether it be wildlife and evolution you are interested in or traditional customs and rites of passage - this is the centre for it all. We had an excellent guide, Jeff, and he gave us a",
          "The Nairobi museum is a must see if you are on your first visit to the city! The entrance fee is reasonable and the displays are well laid out and informative. The early man section is absolutely amazing! The animals of Kenya exhibit was also truly wonderful to see! There is a",
          "I went with a bunch of my friends without really having any sort of expectation as to how the experience would be but it turned out to be one of the most fun days I've had. Great exhibitions with fun facts, super affordable plus great and helpful staff! The animal park was an",
          "I liked the natural history exhibition and the snake park. It was pretty informative as a kenyan i learned new things about culture of other tribes in Kenya. the snake park was not as scary as i had expected. The entrance fee for Kenyans which is good.",
          "This museum is well organised with each section dealing with a special aspect of Kenya's history, nature and culture. There are some large stuffed animals and a large selection of stuffed birds, more that you can count. It is also worth visiting the Snake Park next door. Allow",
          "I visited the National museum and the Snake park for two hours and thought it was well worth the visit. I went for the combo ticket that covers both. There are different list prices for residents and tourists. I was asked if I wanted a guide with me in the museum and I really",
          "The museum is great, with the history of Kenya and the evolution of mankind. You get to learn about the rich history of Kenya and her people. I especially loved the wild animal display in the museum. The wildlife in Kenya is simply spectacular. I loved the Nairobi National",
          "On our last day in Nairobi we visited the museum. I think if we had visited before our safari we would have had a better understanding of all the wildlife in the country. I didn\u2019t know there were so many varieties of birds.",
          "We spent a morning here, both with a museum guide and wondering around on our own. There is a fantastic bird collection and interesting insights into Kenyan culture.",
          "We learned a lot about Nairobi and Kenya history! It was a nice tour about animals and history and different tribes of Kenya. The guide was super nice and she was good to explain and answered all my questions!",
          "Amazing collection showing the evalution of mankind. Excellent Museum guide Rosemary. Would not recommend trying to see all this without a guide.",
          "We visited this musium for 1 hour. its super experiance. You can find kenyas history and their wild life nature. I really apriciate the guide kindness and pacience to explain everything in 1 hour. Thanks",
          "We enjoyed the museum very much. Many unique and very interesting expositions. Good guides! snake centrum was really good too",
          "Well I have enjoyed my time during my visit, especially the snake section, rest of the exhibits are a bit \"dated\" and needs some refurbishing.",
          "The museum has an excellent section on natural history, including a huge collection of stuffed birds (tho strangely missing some of the most common or beautiful). I found the section on the colonial history of Kenya and the resistance movement that led to independence difficult",
          "Value is not great here, costing $15 for an overall pretty boring museum with an average snake park and anemic botanical garden adjacent. Spend your $15 to get you and 2 friends into the Elephant Orphanage instead",
          "Very good collection of sketches and art work from joy adamson, also an amazing set of pre modern man skulls, skeletons. Bird collection of Africa amazing.",
          "An interesting place to discover about the history of Kenya. Snake Park is less interesting. It is recommended for spendiblng several hours during the day. Not cheap-1500 Kes",
          "Nairobi National Museum is a very interested place to visot. Mostly, it contain elements about the wildlife in Nairobi and the history of the preservation which have taken place throughout the years. There are other chambers who h focus on the colonial history of Kenya and",
          "I came here on my first day in Kenya and enjoyed the historical and art exhibits. It is a relatively small museum, but I spent ~1 hour inside. There is a mall/cafe area outside the museum that I enjoyed exploring as well.",
          "Wanted especially to see Turkana boy skeleton which was fantastic. Ahmed of marsabit is also very impressive especially as I had just come back from marsabit.",
          "Soo clean, very welcoming and warm customer service made our few hours of stay at this amazing green national park within our quick expanding city, my friends and I couldn't help stop chanting the prowess of the tour guides and the beautiful well tamed animals in their well kept",
          "Nice way to spend couple of hours away from the dusty and noicy city life. There is large collection of African birds, little bit of the animals and then quite comprehensive display of Kenyan history from millions of years ago to today. There is collection of archeological",
          "We took a guide (the are there to tell you about everything the museum has to offer) and happy we did it. There is much to see, but not always well explained. But our guide did an excellent job. The museum give you information on Kenya, but much much more. So if you're not into",
          "the meuseum is just a walking distance fro m the cbd ,and in there you can read or be guided and learn more about kenya history and close by is the snake park for reptile lovers thats your paradise.",
          "A true definition of art, nature and the Animal kingdom. Reminds one that there is more than just us in this world and that people have so much potential and talent.",
          "This is an excellent museum with excellent guides It will give you a thorough background on Kenya and its tribes--without being deadline. When you go out into Kenya you will have a much better understanding of what you are experenicing",
          "From this museum I've learnt a lot about the history of Kenyan people and wildlife. The wide range of wildlife species especially birds was very educative, most of this birds I have never seen elsewhere.",
          "The museum is modern and eclectic, showing different faces of the history of Kenya from the origins to modern days and includes a vast collection of stuffed birds, but avoid the snake part, pathetic.",
          "This is a very good museum right in the middle of Nairobi. The stuff on display was really interesting things. Perhaps the most interesting one is the one about the origin of Homo Sapiens, which was originated in this region. This museum has a very good display about that, which",
          "Its one of the most informative places at Nairobi about Kenya , Culture , Animals and the human race . 1200 kenyan Shillings is cost for Both National Museum and Snake Park which is co-located . My suggestions pl take a guide from the reception though free of cost but they are",
          "A nice place to spend a few hours. The museum is large and at the outset you can opt for a guide if you wish. If not, you a free to wander around freely. The museum wasn't busy when we went and was fairly peaceful. There are numerous rooms over at least two floors containing a",
          "There are 1300 types of birds in Kenya. There is a very good collection at the National Museum and the history of this young nation really becomes to live in the Museum.",
          "Amazing and informative. Museums are always a great way to learn about culture and history of a place/country.",
          "With some time to kill in Nairobi, we visited the museum. Fantastic facility. Learned so much, and the displays were very informative. The vast number and types of collections was impressive. The staff were helpful and friendly. I was very pleased to see that the gift shop",
          "Although I did not visit inside of the museum being late at the place, I attended a special programme arranged outside of the museum. We were welcomed by tribal men and women at the entrance and also we could see a nice performance from them. The shop inside the museum is also",
          "I love this museum! The people are friendly and very helpful. My intention was to focus on gourds. But, I received much more. Yes, gourds. Gourds are a part of the life of very Kenyan. And, the museum is working to preserve its seed. I met with a number of departments that are",
          "The museum was a good experience. Everyone was kind and helpful. There were not many people as it was Christmas Day. The exhibits were nice.",
          "My mom and I were looking to do something for the afternoon and our hotel suggested the museum. Our guide Chris wad great and we learned a lot about tge history of Kenya.",
          "My team enjoyed this location. It also has a very large bird sectio, in fact, its one of the largest bird section I have ever seen. It is worth your time to stop by and look inside.",
          "I have been visiting the museum for several occasions and most catching fact for every traveller is its historic finds and preservation, especially the scientific belief of first human on earth, the Turkana Boy, their settlement and development. One can enjoy the great reserve",
          "The guided tour through the hall of mammals, cradle of mankind, art galleries, history of Kenya, life cycles and the many bird species was educative. The most fun part is the snake park where there are life snakes, crocodiles, monitor lizards,tortoise and a beautiful aquarium.",
          "We paid$2 pp to have a guide take us around the museum which was interesting to see the tools and how they lived. the snake park was very sad the enclosure was very minimalist, not natural the snakes were just living.",
          "It was a great visit with kids. Loved the birds collection with sizes starting from a few inches ranging upto few feet. Also the historic collection of Kenya and freedom fight segment is worth visiting",
          "It is a nice opportunity to know more about Africa history specially culture, food, animals and political history. I pretty recommender a guide visit, is more interesting and they can solve all your doubts.",
          "Well-preserved history of Kenya, and interestingly the origin of early 'man'. I loved the life-size animal specimen on display. Friendly staff.",
          "My husband and I visited the musuem last week and we loved it! The bird section was unreal, lots of information on each bird with displays of nests, egss, etc. I saw other reviews that said the museum needed more organization but I felt the notes next to each item were clear and",
          "many rooms to visit, nice place to stay when weather is not good outside it mixes animal museum , kenyan history museum, art museum ... you can easily spend 3 hours inside best is to buy a combo ticket for national museum + snake park (snake park is a 30min visit)",
          "My visit to this location was worth every second spent. The artistic curation were carefully done. The location of this monument is well situated and the staff seemed reluctant to assist, however i thoroughly enjoyed the tour",
          "If you have visited or residing around Nairobi you need to visit the Nairobi National Museum; the snake park, evolutionary histories, ancient skulls and so much more to learn",
          "The museum entrance fee was about $12. It is not a large museum, but has many different animals/birds etc If you are in Nairobi and looking for something to do, it is worth a visit.",
          "Lots to see, primary focused on natural history (animals, etc.) and Kenya\u2019s role in human evolution, but also includes informative section on colonial and political history. Safely Walkable from the CBD going via Moi Avenue and Harry Thuku Rd.",
          "It's interesting for Westerners. We came early and were about the only visitors. Added a snake park.",
          "We really enjoyed all the displays at the museum but would have been happy to go just for the bird exhibit. If you are interested to see the array of birds in east Africa, the bird display will give you a great understanding of the enormous variety. There is also a great coffee",
          "The museum is a walking distance from many city hotels. Its rich in history and worthy vising after doing wildlife safaris. Its also connected with snake park for reptiles lovers.",
          "Although a bit more expensive than expected, going to the Nairobi National Museum is a must for anyone visiting the city. One of the most interesting parts is the amazing collection of human fossils, which is rare elsewhere in the world. Learning about the history of Kenya was",
          "Good use of time. Friendly staff. Worth the visit. Opens at 8:30 and there is so much to see. Well worth it",
          "Great museum with many details and pictures. Enjoyed the stamp collection along with the weapons and clothing exhibits. The guides are very knowledgeable. During our visit we were not allowed to take pictures, that was the only drawback. We were later informed that pictures are",
          "I was here for several hours a month ago. Because I had a driver with a set pickup time, I had to estimate how much time I needed, which was 3 hours. I could have spent more time as I wasted a little too much time on the main level looking at the big animal and bird exhibits.",
          "We visited during our stay in Nairobi and enjoyed the museum! You can speed through in 2 hours or you could spend much longer as there\u2019s tons of content. We especially enjoyed the art exhibits. There are guides you can hire at the reception if you want. We purchased the combo",
          "Fascinating Kenyan History. It is all stored and taught to here. Visiting the Kenya National Museum HQ, lets you understand the Kenyan communities cultural heritage and the way there past generations used to live and the means of livelihood",
          "Not miss the \"Turkana boy\" and the incredible collection of birds. You can combine with the next snakes exhibition.",
          "The overall trip to the museum was ok. The highlight was the snake pit. The handler got out 1 for me to hold (shakes ) that was fun",
          "We'd recommend the National Museum if you have a couple of hours to kill after visiting all the top rated attractions in Nairobi. The exterior is very attractive but the interior needs to be updated. The guide that we were assigned basically told us what was written by each",
          "The museum itself is compartmentalised into different sections people can either browse through the collection on their own or pay for a guided tour. The guided tour might be a great option if you are to visit the place as a group. It houses a vast collection of Birds and",
          "I had not been to the NNM for years. Went back with my kids and found the place renovated. Although a lot of the stuff I'd seen as a child are still present, I felt that the modernisation robbed the place the nostalgic feel I had always associated with this museum. Some of the",
          "This is a great place to visit, it was very interesting to learn about the history of Kenya and to see the animal exhibits. Make sure to also visit the snake park.",
          "This is still a favorite place to visit. The exhibits are good and we had a lot of fun. Make sure to visit the snake park for those who like them. A good day spent there",
          "This is certainly a great place to visit just like any major museum in a major city. While I love the mix of natural and historical exhibits on display, I think it's time for a sprucing up, re-imaging, integration of modern-day technologies to bring the place up to date and to",
          "Since we had just come off a safari, we were not too keen to see more giraffes and elephants so we chose three attractions in Nairobi to fill up our waiting time for our late night flight home. We chose the National Museum, Kazuri Bead Factory and Karen Blixen Museum. One thing",
          "Now this is something else! Think animals, think political history, think art, think the history of mankind! It\u2019s all there! The exhibition on the archeological finds is most impressive. Why didn\u2019t I come here as a pupil? I finally got to meet homo erectus!",
          "It was good to learn Kenya's history, and see the different species of birds and wildlife ... great for families... easy tour around museum , not heavy with information . You can go at your own pace",
          "We loved our day at the museum! We expected to stay 2 hours and stayed the entire day. They have a wonderful large permanent bird exhibit of East African birds and the history of Kenya permanent exhibit is also excellent. We learned so much. Great gift shops and restaurant.",
          "There was so much to see. The cafe on site was great too. The reptile and aquarium displays were excellent. I wish I would have had more time to spend in all the exhibits. I would love to visit again next time I\u2019m in Nairobi.",
          "don't be put off by the nay sayers - this is a good collection. I especially enjoyed the bird section and the history of Kenya - in particular the history of independence. the snakes I could take or leave, mainly because we had most of them living under my parents house in",
          "There is a nice exhibit on the tribes of Kenya, and early history up through present. There is also an exhibit on early man, and the bond of a boy found to be about 1.9 million years old. Upstairs there are paintings by Joy Adamson of Born Free fame.",
          "We visited on our first day in Nairobi. You have the option for a guide, which we took. (just tip at the end) This was an incredible introduction to Eastern Africa. The cradle of mankind, the animals, 1300+ birds. It was so helpful for us to see the different types of animals",
          "Really loved visiting here. I gave myself 2 hours but you need more to browse. Loads of information to read. Snake park ok(ish) but very sad to see some snakes in small enclosures with nothing but leaves. The museum is well worth a visit as not much else to do in Nairobii where",
          "Don't forget to visit this museum and learn about the history of this beautiful country. You can understand much more about the Kenya's history, people, culture, tradition or art being there. My son was so excited to see the artifacts from the men evolution, and it is true that",
          "The section on human evolution was quite good but the rest save for the skeleton of a very large elephant was a bit of a let down. I was also disappointed that we were given a guide despite not wanting or requesting one.",
          "the museum is well located and easy to find. it has a rich story of man's and Kenya's early years and gives detailed explanations at each attraction. there is also a snake park that is teaming with different types of snakes and reptiles.",
          "This museum was very interesting and well laid out. Exhibits were well lit and descriptive placards were easy to read and provided excellent information and background for each item on display.",
          "Having a few hours free, I decided to visit the museum and good decision it was. Other than a very extensive display of the local fauna, I found of high interest the displays of the prehistoric human remains. Also enlighting the show of tribal parafernalia and the explanations",
          "We were reccomended to visit the Nairobi National Museum by a staff member at Kwhaze Bed and Breakfast (great place to stay!) and have to say that the museum took us by surprise it was way above any expectations we had. We spent half a day wandering the many rooms of amazing",
          "The Leaky section was very interesting. The snake/reptile part was not worth the extra cost. Easy to get to on your own with a taxi or Uber.",
          "The place is quite small and running down. Some good animal collection but other than that not really worth visiting.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the museum. Unfortunately, we ran out of time and couldn\u2019t see everything we wanted to. The bird collection was vast and I learned a lot about Kenya and the Kenyan people by walking through the museum. Would recommend especially if you are visiting and",
          "I had nothing to do on a Sunday and this was nearby and I'm glad I visited. A nice mix of Kenya natural history and recent history. Fairly small - you can pretty much see everything in under an hour. I particularly loved the sculptures on the grounds.",
          "My wife and I choose to spend a few afternoon hours visiting this museum but we could have spend even more. It is filled with a most amazing collection of items and historical information concerning Kenya and its historical and natural environment. Well worth the visit!",
          "Some of the exhibitions are a little old but they are all very interesting and cover many different areas of Kenyan life. A museum that is well worth a visit even if you are not usually interested in museums.",
          "Very informative exhibits. Extensive information on Africa, Kenya, its flora and fauna, and of course, early human development.",
          "Very nice introduction about Kenyan history. Kids enjoyed the Animals and Birds section. We did not do the snake park.",
          "Nairobi National Museum is a nice introduction to Kenya. There are two main sections; natural history and history and traditions in Kenya. Even the price is quite steep for the foreigners (13 $, 15 $ with the snake park). I recommend a visit. Also worth it is a visit to the",
          "If you want to get a good taste of Kenya history and culture, then this is one of the places to visit. We asked for a tour guide to bring us through and she was most knowledgeable all the areas of the museum. It seemed well kept and laid out nicely from one place to another.",
          "For anyone who wants to know more about Kenya and Kenyan history, I recommend a visit to the museum. We visited with our children and they found the sections talking about different animals, birds and fishes to be fun and educational. That is not to say that adults wouldn't",
          "Looks like this museum has seen better times. It\u2019s dusty and dirty inside and on my visit, some of the exposition areas have been closed. The cafe next to the museum is a good and quiet place. All together, it was not worth the money.",
          "The Museum is worth a trip - I spent an educational 3 hours there. Several of the halls are looking tired with poor lighting and faded exhibits. However, there are also some excellent sections such as the \"Dawn of Man\" and a good section documenting the last few hundred years of",
          "Kenya is a place of rich culture and a deep history that goes back to the origins of humanity itself, around lake Turkana and the Rift Valley. This museum is a good introduction to that rich history, all the way to the horrors of colonialism (concentration camps) and of the",
          "Very well done museum, not the dusty spot it used to be. Examples of the many, many birds endemic to Kenya. Good display of history of Kenya\u2019s independence, including banking system, etc. and old photos. Also, a thorough display of native crafts from several years ago. Also,",
          "A must visit if you are in Nairobi And you like History and nature. Not a massive venue but packed with good interesting exhibits , reasonably priced for Both venues. The museum is very interesting with lots of history and animal exhibits. The snake farm also has plenty of",
          "The museum is not state of the art, but it is full of historical and interesting material. I have been half a dozen times over 5 - 6 years, and always recommend it to friends who travel to Nairobi. Great, really great for kids.",
          "We were fortunate that when we paid our entrance a young man named Nehemiah asked if we wanted a tour guide. We requested this service and he provided an incredible overview history of all the displays. What would have been a static viewing of displays took on a new and",
          "Yes, include this venue on a visit to Nairobi. We were within walking distance of it and had no expectations, but thoroughly enjoyed the displays. The museum does need sprucing up and some of the displays are tired. But don't pass up the opportunity to learn of Kenyan culture",
          "This museum may not seem particularly large to ardent museum frequenters, but it is a thrilling visit, nonetheless. The museum offers a comprehensive, informative explanation and exhibition of the history of Kenya; opening with the ornithological exhibit - this one in particular",
          "Takes around two hours to see both Museum and snake park. We found it very interesting as it shows a lot from the history of Kenya, Nairobi and it\u2019s animals. You can spend a long time here so try not to plan it as a brief visit. At least 2-2.5hrs. It was pretty unreal to see",
          "When I asked the driver how long I should leave for the museum he said, \"some take 30 minutes. Some take 2 hours.\" I took 2 hours. It's not a large museum, but it's filled with a lot of interesting things about the history of Kenya, Africa and the origin of man. I'm not one for",
          "Surprisingly informative visit to a small museum with a lot of information. Highlights included a history of Kenya and the fight for independence, spectacular collection of Kenya's birds and mammals, collections of Joy Adamson's work with an explanation of her importance in the",
          "We enjoyed a two hour tour of the museum. We didn\u2019t exoect to have a guide but one was offered and she did add to the tour. It\u2019s an interesting perspective on Kenya\u2019s physical, social and political growth and history. We were glad we visited.",
          "My husband and I visited the Nairobi National Museum and really enjoyed it. There were several different exhibits, from prehistoric human skulls to animals to tribal artifacts and more. We spent about 1.5 hours there and learned lots about Kenya's history- both the people and",
          "It was amazing. It was big and had a lot of interesting things. I really loved it. You get to see the history of humans and the history of Kenya as well. It also had a section of all animals and facts around them. It was very interesting and i recommend you visit.",
          "Not quite New York's Museum of Natural History but very informative and full of quality displays. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The museum's vast collection of animals (taxidermy) was astounding. Just the bird section was humongous, and you could spend almost half an hour there itself. The sections about humans and culture (including real ancient tools that they used) were very interesting and",
          "The museum offered guided Tour planed according to interests and the short time we had, due to driver waiting. Gide are free of charge but accept tips\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe The museum has a great historical exibition and also all vild game animals. There is a snakke park too. Cafe with food clean",
          "One of the greatest outcomes of the exhibition were the birds collection. Another interesting part was the habits and decorations of the different tribes. As always for me, the history was interesting.",
          "I liked going to the Nairobi museum, as it gave good insight and info on African animals, as well as the evolution of humans. It reminded me of a smaller Natural History Museum. I, personally, found the snake park way more interesting. There was a huge variety of reptiles, and",
          "They are keeping their history safe. It is always good to explore the old days. Plenty of knowledge for the young students. It was an amazing experience visiting this place. Staff was very cooperative and helpful.",
          "The museum is a worthwhile attraction if you are looking for a background in Kenyan history, wildlife and culture. It is absolutely worth having the guide (its also free). The guides are knowledgable interns that can walk you through the museum and add a considerable amount of",
          "The Nairobi National Museum offers a useful overview of the natural history and fauna of Kenya, which is a good thing to do in advance of a safari, in addition to some descriptions of the cultural traditions and political history. It will take about two hours. I don't advise",
          "It's a dump; a dusty dump. The exhibits are shabby, shopworn. The exhibits are entirely without imagination or creativity. \"Pathetic\" is the word that best describes this museum. The stuffed animal exhibits, the Birds of Kenya particularly, are either disgusting or funny,",
          "I was keen to learn more about this fascinating country & it\u2019s history . Whilst the cradle of man exhibition promised much it didn\u2019t really deliver. There appears to be many replica animals and their remains that don\u2019t really offer any deeper insight into the countries history.",
          "Excellent displays showing the origins of man and the story of evolution. Exciting skulls and artefacts going back to the beginning of time",
          "The variety may lack but what you get is worth it. Close contact with the giraffes is an experience you will never get anywhere else, and that I gurantee. Kiss a giraffe literally anywhere you tell me",
          "Great museum, very conveniently located nearer to Nairobi's central business district, with ample parking and great access to the highway. The museum itself is fairly small and probably needs about 2 hours to complete along with the nearby snake park, located within the same",
          "Although the museum needs some refurbishment, it is a great place if you would like to learn about the country\u2018s history and the culture of all 42 tribes. We spent a lot of time in the History section and Tribes section where there is lots of information on Kenya\u2018s colonization,",
          "We only planned the visit to fill a couple of hours on the last day of our visit to Nairobi, and to be honest didn't have high expectations, but it certainly exceeded our expectations - both adults and kids. You can consider it two museums in one: one dedicated to animals and",
          "This was somewhere I have always wanted to visit. The cradle of mankind exhibit is amazing - the collection of early human skulls and the \u201cTurkana boy\u201d skeleton are incredible dating back millions of years. The skeleton of Ahmed of Marsabit and his 68kg tusks is phenomenal.",
          "The museum seems to be very old and not taken care of. Also the exhibits are totally not organized and it is difficult to know where to find what. There is a room depicting the colonial history until independence and another room depicting the circle of life from the viewpoint",
          "My wife and I (both late 20s) visited the museum during our one day in Nairobi before heading on safari. There is a restaurant which provided a drink at a reasonable price, and also a gift shop although we did not buy anything. We spent roughly 90 minutes inside the museum and",
          "My best part was the aquarium room. It gave a feeling as though I was right under the water watching the fishes. Quite relaxing.",
          "Its in middle of Nairobi and has lot of information about Kenyan history. Entry fees are different for Kenyans and non-Kenyans",
          "I arrived at the museum concurrently with three bus-loads of schoolchildren. I have to say that the artifacts are small in number and that it is more of a document museum than a cultural museum. The children were loud and it didnt leave much space for any real study of the",
          "A great place to visit, and inexpensive as well. There are a lot of exhibits to see, and most of them are quite modern. The most interesting exhibit is the one which chronicles human evolution and provides the fossils of our past ancestors.",
          "Recommend any traveller in Kenya to spend 1h-2h in this small but nice museum to get a better undertanding of Kenya history, society, flora and fauna. The museum is small but nice, content of the exhibitions well presented and easy to understand. Good experience.",
          "Interesting exhibits showing the various aspects of flora and fauna and economy of Kenya as it evolved.Enjoyable experience !",
          "The exhibitions are perhaps a bit brief and they vary a lot in their topics, but they are very informative and interesting. Especially the one about prehistoric times. Well worth a visit.",
          "Was there a few days ago with my Kenyan wife and stepson, I've seen this in other countries and I'm pretty sure that if Kenyans were to visit the UK and be forced to pay hiked prices for similar places theyd be mighty pissed off. The entrance fee for me as a foregner was a",
          "I'm not really a big fan of museums, but the gardens are very nice and the reptile house is also interesting.",
          "This museum is really well done and it would be easy to spend the better part of a day here. The history of Kenya is told in such an interesting way. And the exhibit on early man is fascinating. I am not a nut for museums at all but this is worth a visit for at least a morning.",
          "An interesting smallish museum that had some unusual artifacts however some updating is called for. There is a large display of very Victorian looking stuffed birds that are in very dusty cases with descriptions that were made a long time ago ( mentions of Tanganyika as a",
          "The exterior decorations were impressive, as were the stained glass windows. The highlights inside the museum were the animal skeletons, the bird collection, and the paintings. There could have been better signage to guide tourists through the various rooms of the museum.",
          "Our first day in Nairobi, we spent a few hours here and it was so worth it! A wonderful introduction to the culture, the history, and the people of Nairobi and all of Kenya. James was our guide, so knowledgeable about everything! He also has a unique perspective from a local",

          "Very nice place to get to know Kenya's history under one roof. Educational for kids. They also have a snake park in their premises. A must visit if you are in Kenya.",
          "Some interesting exhibits here but sort of aimed at school education.Several halls devoted to animals,birds,ethnology etc.Optional snake park.",
          "If you want to understand history of Kenya and role of England in their history, you are on right place. The place is very nice, presenting all the most relevant parts of Kenya's history. Museum is very well maintained, peaceful and good organized. Please do not forget to start",
          "We certainly wanted to visit Kenya's national museum before we would leave the country, so we planned it for the last day. We were offered a personal guide and accepted happily. The young woman, a student at the nearby university walked us through all the exhibits and explained",
          "I enjoyed my visit with my friends,learnt alot, took lots of pictures. Beautiful environment. Keep it up!!!!",
          "I do enjoy visiting this museum, the vast range of exhibits and topics covered is impressive. Sadly, and this is not unique to NNM, it's old fashioned displays are tired, dusty, often poorly lit, and the display windows dirty, reflecting, I think, the usual lack of funds",
          "This is a nice museum, on entry I was told to wait and assigned a guide. The chap was pleasant and knowledgeable but I felt rushed around and did not see everything they had on display. There were several large parties of school children so museum was crowded. 3 main exhibit",
          "If you want a little bit of some african/Kenyan historical evidence,this is the place to visit.Come witness some of the Kenyan animal species monkies,lions,cheetahs,snakes and many more.As you walk around viewing there are readily available guides to give you a little bit of",
          "enjoyed with our clients paying a visit to the museum..Had a good experience but for those who get nightmares on seeing snakes,then do'nt do the snake part!",
          "Despite numerous visits, there's alwags something new to learn and admire. It's a rich repository of our history although lacking in some details, it's good for a general overview. The human evolution section is well set out with an awesome ambience while the snake park could",
          "If you're a History Buff, then the Nairobi National Museum is the place to visit. First because of it's close proximity to the Hennessis hotel, a brisk walk should get you there in under 30 minutes. Located in the same premises is the Snake park and the Artcaffe. After browsing",
          "We spent several hours in the museum and enjoyed very much the enormous birds collection and especially the part about mammals and the development of the human species. I have seen better snake parks though, so I recommend rather to spent more time in the museum itself.",
          "The best place to visit in Nairobi city with short time period. It\u2019s highly recommend for family tour also because it can be improved the historical knowledges.",
          "Very good museum giving insight into history, culture and past of Kenya. More eternally worth joining their museum society which gets you free entrance into sights throughout kenya for a reasonable price.",
          "I purchased the non-resident SH 1500 combo ticket which included the Snake House. After checking my bag with umbrella(no charge), I accepted the option of a guided tour (thank you Faith!). The museum tour was at my pace and lasted about 1.5 hours. The Cradle Of Civilization",
          "We entered the museum and did also pay for private tour in the museum. That was really amazing experience to learn about Kenya culture and and get everything explained and nice storytelling as well. The museum is rather big and we spend about 3 hours so see everything + the",
          "A lot of Kenyas history in that museum. You can easyly use a whole day there. Nice guides that know what they talk about.",
          "Lovely museum in the city. The beginnings of Africa, an exhibit of the Tribes of Africa by Joy Adamson, and also some of the artifacts from the Leaky's excavations.",
          "We enjoyed our time at the national museum, particularly the snake exhibition. As museums go, the price was very reasonable at ksh600 per resident for a combined snake and museum ticket. We also found the restaurant to be reasonably priced too. Unfortunately, our time was",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the museum and had a great guide who was able to answer all of the questions that I bombarded him with as some of the cultural exhibits are wonderful and it was good to get the whole story of Kenya's past. Also the restaurant is worth a visit -",
          "Well worth the time spent. Amazing displays covering history of Kenya, amazing bird display, amazing animals. Great contemporary art. And on top of it all a real experience walking from the city centre and dodging traffic to get there and back!",
          "Initially I didn't want a guide but I'm so happy I had one along. The guide really helps to bring the exhibits to life and saves times as you don't have to read every plaque in the museum. It was also helpful to hear a locals perspective on many of the cultural displays. Don't",
          "The combination ticket costs 1500 Kenyan shilling. This will give you admission to the national museum of Nairobi, art gallery, snake and reptile park and botanical gardens. Don't miss the crocodiles and alligators - close up. A great way to discover a bit more about Kenya, it",
          "We paid Ksh 300 for a taxi to the museum and KSh 1200 for entrance fee. We wandered around the museum for a good hour. The museum could do with a guide path because we almost missed seeing the bird collection. Great place to see all the different cultures and the history of Kenya",
          "The admission fee of around \u20ac10,- would not be so bad, if there was anything at all making it a worthwhile visit! The pre-historic section shows some would-be-interesting artefacts, but gives you almost no information along with them, so you end up looking at stuff without",
          "The museum has seen better days and I don't like seeing stuffed animals. They even have a whole room full of stuffed birds. The section on some of the tribes was the most interesting part. I gained a lot more information from visiting the National Archives and the National",
          "When purchasing your tickets, you have the option to include the snake park with your visit to the museum. We opted for the former. The visit was about 1.5 hours in length. The museum captures Kenya\u2019s history - the good and the bad. It was interesting to read how far Kenya has",
          "Well, nothing best like strolling into the museum on foot from the city center on a sunday afternoon, you will love the old smell vintage in the museum while your kids enjoy the snake park and aquarium, worth every coin !!",
          "We spendet wonderful hours here. A lot information in the museum about the past of Kenya and the animals living here. Learning about the culture and tradition. A guided tour with lot more information I would give as a tip. The snake park is also included with a combined",
          "The museum is a bit run down but definitely worth a visit. There is something that everyone will enjoy from a room full of stuffed birds to a room full of stuffed safari animals. There is also an exhibit on \"early man\" fossils from Lake Turkana (discovered by the Leakey family)",
          "Spent a couple of hours at this wonderful museum, excellent presentations of human history, wildlife, indigenous culture. Highly recommend it, and it is a relatively short walk from the city.",
          "Has something for adults and kids. The snake park a b day the aquarium are a hit with the little ones, while the museum areas may interest adult visitors.",
          "The British removed much of anything of value from Kenya before the gained their independence. It showed in the lack of exhibits. However, the museum does try to make the best of what I does have. The extent of the bird section is impressive and well worth a visit there. Some",
          "We had a private guide for the 2-story museum. Nice overview of the history, animals and a huge collection of the birds of East Africa. A bit old fashioned, but worth visiting. Takes about 90 minutes",
          "We visited this attraction when visiting Kenya recently. I must say that ,by and large we went in order to'kill' a morning as it was said to be a must do when in Nairobi. Overall, it was ok for that purpose but in relation to other so called 'national museums' it all seemed",
          "This museum is done the way we did museums in the 50s. Lots of stuff with little or no explanation. The mixture of history and art and natural history and the snake center can at best be called exotic... The snake center which is part of the same ticket is a sad sad experience",
          "Included this museum to the last day of our trip in Nairobi. Only spent about 1 hour here mainly to see the pre historic artefacts. Could be better in terms of offering more exhibits for tourists.",
          "We visited this attraction whilst in Kenya and bought a double ticket for 1500 Kenyan shillings. What annoyed us to start with was that the local population paid a very small fraction of the price and we felt this unfair as this sort of discrimination is not applied in most",
          "Well worth a visit - rooms full of stuffed birds, animals of Kenya, artifacts and an amazing room of Skelton\u2019s and skulls over a million years old.",
          "Visited 2 weeks ago. Fascinating displays particularly the origins of human. Amazing displaynof the bird life of Kenya. Also not to be missed is the Independence struggle for Kenya against the Colonial rulers. I was also privileged to be able to see the wedding photos of a",
          "Rural culture and past traditions are quickly visible here. The artefacts are decent but its a small museum. They can surely do better to give an experience of aspects of the culture like music and food. An easy quick visit is fine if you have the time",
          "There are exhibits at the museum that are 1.6 million years old. To tour the total museum and snake park is probably a days experience. Unfortunately we were on a tight schedule.",
          "Interesting content! Especially the anthropological section (homo evolution)! Visitors need more than one hour to look around despite what we have been told in ticket office. Snake park is also nice and worth a visit but cages should be cleaned at some point.The price for",
          "We enjoyed spending a couple hours here but it could use some sprucing up. There are some interesting historical exhibits discussing Kenyan independence and the rebellion of the Mau Mau. There is some contemporary art and some examples of the natural history of the country.",
          "January, 11/2018, I had to deposit my small backpack at the reception. When I went back to my hotel, late in the afternoon, I've checked all my documents, brochures, invoices, expenses, etc ....... and ........surprise !! 200 Euros have disappeared !! I've no doubts, the",
          "You can get round the whole museum in a couple of hours. We didn't have time to visit the Snake Park which is part of it, but I heard it's good.",
          "There is a lot to see from animals to tribal history in Kenya but the most interesting part was the archaeological section where you could learn about Lucy and the other ancestors of humans. A good guide will be able to make the experience more rewarding. This is a bit of an old",
          "Good exhibits that are pretty self explanatory but guides a personal touch that is quite useful. Mix of old and new (some galleries around). Food at the on-site restaurant was good and fairly priced (for a tourist attraction). Botanical garden is small but the grounds around",
          "A real recommendation if you have some hours to while away in Nairobi. There are the rift valley finds of early man kind, which is outstanding. There are some disturbing stuffed animals but also some gallery space for art. There is also a small cafe if you need refreshment.",
          "The museum has a variety of historical bones, skulls, animal, birds exhibits mixed with some local history and culture. All presented in an old style fashion and buildings.",
          "Highly recommended particularly the sections on human evolution animals and the history of Kenya. Would recommend combining with a ticket to the Snake Park in the same complex with particularly friendly guides and excellent range of snakes and reptiles.",
          "The museum is small (you can tour it in 2 hours if you walk slowly) but it's definitely worth a visit. Our favorite part was the section on human evolution which has bones and skeletons thousands of years old that have been found in Kenya. The part on the history of Kenya was",
          "For those who love wildlife, environmental, cultural, and political history about kenya, I think the Nairobi national Museum should be your next destination. The archeological artifacts of the evolution of man, the artwork and the section on the different species of birds",
          "I'm so glad friends recommended going to this museum early in our Kenya experience. It was very helpful in understanding the history and wildlife of Kenya, as well as the anthropological discoveries that have been made in Kenya and Africa as a whole. Some of the exhibits can be",
          "Very well arranged and has a load of things that you can see. It neighbors the snake park so you can also visit. One payment that you make at the museum also allows you to access the snake park.",
          "I loved the exhibit showing the similarities of different types of animals. I had no idea! It showed great examples of adaptations. The bird exhibit was beautiful and striking. We spent an hour and a half in the museum, but easily could have been there for 3-4 hours.",
          "Not much of museum type BUT that one is worth it thanks to diverse permanent exhibition on kenya politics and tribes and temp exhibit of kenyan artists. We really enjoyed our time there. Worth the money!!!",
          "If you are in Nairobi and you want to learn more history about Kenya and Africai in large then this is the place to be. At the museum you can also interact with snakes at the adjacent snake park.",
          "At entrance we start with snake cages. Beautiful snakes, crocodiles and tortoises. Wonderful preservation of ancient archeological discoveries. A must see place.",
          "Nice, quiet museum with great exhibits on the history of Kenya, human fossils and East African birds.",
          "The museum is average. Not much to see, just some Kenya history. You may skip this if you don't have much time in Nairobi.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the National Museum in Nairobi and was happy to see it filled with Kenyans on a weekend instead of just foreign tourists. The addition of a tour guide helped a lot. It was free but tips were expected at the end and I was happy to give one to my guide",
          "We really did enjoy the museum but for non residents I find it a bit too expensive (~10\u20ac), especially since it isn't really in a great condition. So I fear that the revenue is not used to fund the museum, which is disappointing to me. The washrooms are a DISGRACE. What I liked",
          "The museum is worth a visit, with interesting exhibits about the history of Kenya and its animals. We visited prior to going to the Masai Mara and the animal exhibits provided good context for the trip ahead.",
          "Anational museum promises so much but this offers very little in reality. I didn't come out knowing much more about this extraordinary country, the intrigue, the history, the tribal cultures. You are better off finding a knowledgable friend and peppering them with questions over",
          "We were lucky to have a very good guide we saw many many intresting stuff inside, mixed between history, animals, science..ets Highly recommended.",
          "I love this museum. Greatest collection of stuffed birds i have ever seen. If you\u2019re a bird enthusiast then this a great place to view specimens upclose. Other than the rude staff, I always enjoy visiting the museum as much as i can whenever i come to Nairobi.",
          "A great museum that's easy to get round with clearly labelled displays. It covers just about everything you need to know about the country - people, for, history and geography. The wildlife displays in particular are excellent. Behind the museum there is also a small snake park",
          "Visited the Museum and snake park on my final day in Kenya.....although there is plenty of Kenyan history throughout the layout is a little random. Still a good place to stop by if you're passing.",
          "This is not very well laid out and to be honest, a little random. The exhibitions are numbered but not in numerical order which takes a while to pair them up. The content is good and it's a clean place. There are some parts which could do with an upgrade. I'd recommend if it's",
          "We had a guide and within one and a half hour we knew everything about the most important cultural symbols, tribes and Kenyan wildlife. A perfect start for our travels through Kenya.",
          "I hadn't been in a long time. In addition to good collections of flora and fauna and culture and history, they have wonderful art displays and permanent sculptures and photography. Nice cafe and beautiful grounds too!",
          "I love everything about this museum! The personal docent was a particularly nice touch and made me feel very special. The one exhibit I will always rave about to anyone who will listen is the \"Birds Of Kenya\" room. I have never seen such an extensive collection of taxidermied",
          "If you are at all interested in evolution, paleontology, Kenyan history or customs, We would highly recommend a visit of at least two hours. Request a guide. (They are volunteers, who are trained in tourism industry, and who work for tips. )",
          "The orphanage is one pocket friendly and educative treat for the under 10. Super Exciting for the young ones to see quite a good number of animals. The lions feeding time is unforgettable for my 3yr son.",
          "We needed to pass a few hours and thought this would be fun. There is a lot about Kenyan history that I did not know. This place has amazing displays! There is an entire room dedicated to all the different birds of Kenya. This is a great place to go if you love history.",
          "Fantastic place which really opened my eyes to the suffering of these people under colonial rule. It\u2019s a must if you want to learn about Kenya and I would say no trip is complete without it",
          "We only spent a couple of hours here and maybe we would have gotten more out of it if we had a guided tour, however I was a little disappointed with the museum. I don't think it did Kenya any justice and there was probably a lot more they could have included. I also thought the",
          "We visited this museum on our first day in Nairobi and it was a great introduction to Kenya. We had a guided tour (with George) and I would recommend opting for a guide. I think you will get a lot more out of your visit. The displays are a bit tired looking so having a guide to",
          "This is a nice place to begin seeing what Africa is about. They have extensive information about all of the the early human skeleton finds by the Leakey group. They also have extensive collection of the animals and birds found in Africa. There are also other areas devoted to",
          "The National Museum of Kenya is situated on your way to Westlands. There is alot to learn from all kinds of birds in Kenya to the snake park for those willing to learn more about the different snakes. I am not a fan of snakes but i still visited to learn more. The Leakey",

          "I just went to Nairobi National Museum where I met with local group of birdwatchers which meets here every week at 8.45 in the morning. We saw so many species of birds. I'm looking forward to returning because I met so many guides who share my passion for birdwatching.",
          "Take time out to visit the Museum if you have a couple of hours to spare. It is interesting, informative and good fun, to be enjoyed by children and adults. The snake park is also well worth the visit, this can be combined with the entrance fee of the Museum, with staff to",
          "We had a very short visit to NAIROBI National Musuem...and at the end of it we felt like we should have spend a day at this place.The museum is so beautiful planned and maintained...and the collection of stuffed birds took my breath away and of course the exhibits of the old",
          "Very interesting, and had a great tour guide. I learned a lot about the history of Nairobi. The museum was well keep and very organized.",
          "An awesome place of history from the beginning of human kind. Fantastic animal displays, including a mammoth, prehistoric man, and the hugest collection of birds I have ever seen. There are also some amazing art works, and exhibitions by a displaying artist. The day we went it",

          "Naturally good collection of various skeleton / skulls of pre-historic humans etc. It also has an extensive and impressive collection of African birds. One complaint is that foreigners need to pay 6 times higher compare with Keyans! BTW the snake park is very poor with very",
          "The museum is full of fascinating displays. It's huge so allow plenty of time or do it in sections. I found the Masai displays most interesting. And then we visited the Snake House. Well! I hadn't planned on touching them! There was this gorgeous little golden snake wrapped",

          "In addition to the fairly well presented exhibits, with decent English captioning, the grounds are walkable and include a reptile park (extra fee), where you may have a chance to hold leopard tortoises, a chameleon and baby python. Three craft shops offer decently priced items.",
          "Signage was excellent for an English speaker. There were a wide range of birds from Kenya, and some mammals. There was a display about the evolution of the species. The snake exhibit was outside, and we hadn't bought the correct ticket to see the snakes as well as the",

          "The exhibition is mostly presented in quite a boring, old-fashioned way. Our guide could not tell us anything more than what was written on the signs. Apart from a vast collection of Kenya's birds and other wild animals, the most interesting part is about Kenya's history -",

          "Not sure why the ratings jump from Very Good to Average as this Museum is somewhere in between. I went because reviews here said there were original fossils of early hominids but this is not the case. All displayed hominid fossils - including those found in Kenya are only casts.",
          "The National Museum is clearly one of Kenya's most understated assets. In it there is a full record of significant historical events from pre to post colonial history. In addition, there are excellent photographs, artifacts and stuffed animals that make it exciting for children.",

They serve a wide variety of meat and were famous for their game meat until Kenya imposed a ban on the sale of game meat in 2004. It remains a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1999, the restaurant seated 350 people and the restaurant's 330 employees served over 1000 people per day. The game, including giraffe, wildebeest, ostrich and crocodile, was raised on Hopcraft Ranch, 40 kilometres (25 mi) outside Nairobi. Since the sale of wild game meat was banned in Kenya in 2004, the restaurant serves meat of domestic animals such as beef, pork, lamb, and chicken, as well as farmed ostrich and crocodile meat. The meat is skewered on Maasai swords, cooked on coals, and served on cast-iron plates. It does have a vegetarian option. It ranked 47th on Restaurant magazine's \"World's Best 50 Restaurants\" list in 2003.\n\n\n== Simba Saloon ==\nThere is also a \"Simba Saloon\" night club on the premises with a capacity of 2,500, as well as an internet cafe, playground, and six bars. The restaurant holds concerts featuring local artists. International artists such as Shaggy, Tevin Campbell, T.O.K., and Sean Paul have also performed there. Three people died in a stampede at the saloon in 2004. The restaurant is famous for themed nights that incorporate old skul, rock and soul nights to the merriment of many Kenyans.\n\n\n== Tamarind Group ==\nCarnivore is owned by Martin Dunford of the Tamarind Group. It was opened in 1980 by Dunford, his wife, and a group of partners.  Dunford opened Carnivore, inspired by the Rod\u00edzio concept of Brazilian churrascaria steak houses. The Tamarind Group operates Tamarind seafood restaurants in Mombasa and Nairobi. There are also similar restaurants named Carnivore, owned by the same people, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa, and in Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of restaurants in South Africa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nh2g2 article",

        "wiki": "A mausoleum is an external free-standing building constructed as a monument enclosing the interment space or burial chamber of a deceased person or people. A monument without the interment is a cenotaph. A mausoleum may be considered a type of tomb, or the tomb may be considered to be within the mausoleum.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe word mausoleum derives from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (near modern-day Bodrum in Turkey), the grave of King Mausolus, the Persian satrap of Caria, whose large tomb was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.Historically, mausolea were, and still may be, large and impressive constructions for a deceased leader or other person of importance. However, smaller mausolea soon became popular with the gentry and nobility in many countries. In the Roman Empire, these were often in necropoles or along roadsides: the via Appia Antica retains the ruins of many private mausolea for miles outside Rome. When Christianity became dominant, mausolea were out of use.Later, mausolea became particularly popular in Europe and its colonies during the early modern and modern periods. A single mausoleum may be permanently sealed. A mausoleum encloses a burial chamber either wholly above ground or within a burial vault below the superstructure. This contains the body or bodies, probably within sarcophagi or interment niches. Modern mausolea may also act as columbaria (a type of mausoleum for cremated remains) with additional cinerary urn niches. Mausolea may be located in a cemetery, a churchyard or on private land.\nIn the United States, the term may be used for a burial vault below a larger facility, such as a church. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, California, for example, has 6,000 sepulchral and cinerary urn spaces for interments in the lower level of the building. It is known as the \"crypt mausoleum\". In Europe, these underground vaults are sometimes called crypts or catacombs.\n\n\n== Notable mausolea ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nMausoleum of Mohammed V\nBourguiba mausoleum\nEl Alia Cemetery, Mausoleum of the Late President, Algeria.\nThe Dr. John Garang De Mabior mausoleum in Juba, South Sudan.\nMastabas dating from ancient Egypt.\nAgostinho Neto's Mausoleum in Luanda, Angola.\nMausol\u00e9e (Pyramide) du Pr\u00e9sident Mathieu Kerekou, Natitingou, Benin.\nOmar Bongo's Mausoleum (A replica of the Mausoleum of Mohammed V)  in Franceville, Gabon.\nL\u00e9on M'ba's Memorial Mausoleum in Libreville, Gabon.\nKwame Nkrumah Mausoleum\nMausoleum of Late President Levy Mwanawasa, Frederick Chiluba and Michael Sata at Embassy Park in Lusaka, Zambia.\nDomoni Mosque Mausoleum Indoor inside first president of Comoros, Ahmed Abdallah's Mausoleum.\nMarien Ngouabi's mausoleum and Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's mausoleum in Brazzaville, The Republic of Congo.\nMausoleum of the late president Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Yamoussoukro, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nLaurent Kabila's mausoleum in Kinshasa, The Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe pyramids of ancient Egypt and Nubian pyramids are also types of mausolea.\nGamal Abdel Nasser Mosque, is the Mausoleum of Gamal Abdel Nasser, in Cairo, Egypt.\nUnknown Soldier Memorial (Egypt)\nRoyal Mausoleum of Mauretania\nAl Hussein Mosque, Cairo \u2013 Holy Shrine and mausoleum, and purported grave of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson.\nQalawun Mausoleum is the Mausoleum of Qalawun, Located in Cairo, Egypt, it was regarded by scholars as the second most beautiful medieval mausoleum ever to be built.\nJedars -

      "name": "Karura Forest",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Karura Forest is an urban forest in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The forest was gazetted in 1932 and is managed by the Kenya Forest Service in conjunction with the Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association [1].\nKarura Forest is 1,041 ha (2,570 acre) consisting of three parts separated by Limuru and Kiambu roads. The large middle portion is ca. 710 ha (1,750 acres); the Sigria salient to the west is ca. 250 ha (620 acres). The portion to the east of Kiambu road has been allocated to special national priorities. As of mid-2016, 36% of the forest contains indigenous upland forest tree species. The forest is home to some 200 species of bird as well as suni, Harveys Duiker, bushbucks, bush pigs, genets, civets, honey badgers, bush babies, porcupines, Syke's monkeys, bush squirrels, hares, fruit bats, and various reptiles and butterflies. Karura now has over 50 km of trails for visitors to walk, run or bike.Due to its proximity to a growing city, there have been plans to reduce the forest in favour of housing and other development. However, these plans have been controversial with conservationists. In the late 1990s there were housing projects that would have excised portions of the forest. Conservationists, led by Wangari Maathai, the leader of Green Belt Movement who later became a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, carried out a much publicised campaign for saving the forest. Karura Forest became also a symbol of controversial land grabbings in Kenya.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKarura Forest has an area of 1 063.0 ha, making it largest of three main gazetted forest in Nairobi. The others are Ngong Forest and Oloolua Forest. The centrally located Nairobi Arboretum is much smaller.Karura Forest is located north of central Nairobi and is bordered by the suburbs of Muthaiga, Gigiri, Runda, Ridgeways, Mathare North, Peponi and New Muthaiga. The western part of the forest is also known as Sigiria Forest.The area north of central Nairobi forms a drainage basin and was once heavily forested, but exists today only as patches like Karura Forest and City Park. The forest is cut by Thigirie, Getathuru, Rui Ruaka and Karura Rivers, all tributaries of Nairobi River.Features in the forest include a waterfall, bamboo forest, marshland, Mau Mau caves and an old church.The United Nations Office at Nairobi and UNEP headquarters are located adjacent to the forest. The Karura Forest Product Research Centre is also located there.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nWildlife in the forest include Monkey species (including recently re-introduced Colobus Monkeys), bush baby, bushbuck, bush pig, porcupine, duiker, genet, dik dik, African civet and East African epauletted fruit bat.Plant species typical to the forest include Olea europaea (var. africana), Croton megalocarpus, Warburgia ugandensis, Brachyleana huillensis and the Uvaridendron anisatum.\n\n\n== Development projects and environmental issues ==\nParts of the forest were degazetted by Minister of Environment Jeremiah Nyagah in 1989. Between 1994 and 1998 a total of 564.14 hectares of the forest were secretly allocated to 64 different companies for housing projects. Around 1995 there were plans to build a housing estate in the forest, but opposition by local residents led to temporary shelving of the plans.The projects revitalised again in September 1998, when the Forest Department was issued a quit notice by private developers. The clearing of the forest started igniting fierce protests by environmentalists and others concerned. On 7 October 1998 the construction site was invaded by demonstrators, including 12 opposition MP's. The protest turned violent and bulldozers and other machinery used to clear the forest was destroyed worth more than 80 million Ksh ($2 US million).Minister for Lands and Settlements Noah Katana Ngala released a list of companies who had been allocated land in Karura Forest in November 1998. However, the records of those companies were not found at Registrar General's office, making it difficult to trace the individuals behind these companies.On 8 January 1999 when a group of women led by Wangari Maathai were holding a demonstration by planting trees near the forest, a large group of security guards attacked them. Several of them were injured, including Maathai who was taken to Nairobi Hospital. The police were reluctant to investigate the incident. However, the Attorney-General Amos Wako apologised to Maathai and promised an inquiry on the incident.The Time Magazine, in support of Maathai, named her a Hero of the Week in 1998. Klaus T\u00f6pfer, the executive director of UNEP, warned that the organisation may move its headquarters out of Kenya if the forest faces destruction. The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also condemned the attack on Maathai. Architectural Association of Kenya asked in November 1998 Kenyan architects not to be involved with any design that would threaten the forestKenyan President Daniel arap Moi criticised the protesters and asked the Church not to involve itself with the saga. Minister for Natural Resources Francis Lotodo defended the projects in January 1999 stating that Nairobi as a growing city needed space for development. Professor R. A. Obudho of University of Nairobi, who specialises in urbanisation, also supported the projectsUniversity of Nairobi students held several demonstrations for preservation the forest. On 20 January 1999 several students were injured when they clashed with police. The University if Nairobi was closed temporarily following the protests, and all students were ordered to leave the campus. Opposition MP's James Orengo (Ford-Kenya), David Mwenje (DP) and Njehu Gatabaki (SDP) were charged in court for attending student protests.Eventually housing plans were taken down in lack of public support, but land allocations still stood in place.In 2003 the NARC government led by Mwai Kibaki replaced the long-standing Moi-led KANU-government. In 2003 the Minister of Environment Newton Kulundu denied the American investor Raymond Chisholm a permit to construct a hotel in the forest. Learning that the new government would revoke dubious KANU-era land allocations, developers started to relinquish their properties in the forestThe new Kenya Forests Act in 2005  made it more difficult to degazette forests in Kenya, thus protecting Karura Forest as wellThere was a project by Kenya Forest Service, UNEP and Red Cross Kenya in 2008 to cut down eucalyptus and blue gum trees in parts of the forest and plant indigenous species in their place. Green Belt Movement was doubtful with the project, fearing that logging of the forest could actually lead to private developers invading the forestIn 2009 it was reported that part of the forest had been allocated to the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). This plan was also opposed by Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement, who stated that the NEMA should be protecting, not destructing the forest.The Nairobi Northern Bypass road, constructed in 2009, passes through a wetland that contributes to one of the five Karura Forest water courses, thus posing a threat to the forest.Karura Forest had a reputation as dangerous spot. Muggings, robbery and violence were common. At one point, said Kenya Forest Service (KFS) Head of the Nairobi Conservancy, Charity Munyasia,  they were discovering one dead body there per fortnight, on average. The Chief Forester was actually mugged in his own forest.The new Kenya Forests Act (2005) also provided for the establishment of Community Forest Associations (CFA). In 2009 an initiative was thus formed under the name 'Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association'. Recognising the growing threats to Karura from uncontrolled development the neighbouring Muthaiga and Gigiri Residents Associations begin discussions in early 2009 to form a Community Forest Association for Karura. A letter of intent circulated to northern Nairobi neighbourhoods residents, heads of agencies and VIPs under joint signature of KFS and the Muthaiga Residents\u2019 Association (MRA). A stakeholders\u2019 Working Committee was formed to steer the process, and, in order to raise awareness, it organised a media event in the form of the opening of Karura's \u2018Family Trail\u2019 on 16 May 2009 with the Hon. Noah Wekesa, Minister for Forestry and Wildlife, presiding. Hundreds of stakeholders participated in walking the length of the trail. On 25 May 2009 KFS wrote a letter to the Registrar of Societies expressing No Objection to the registration of the new CFA. Between April and July 2009 FKF-CFA office-bearers completed the required vetting processes with the Criminal Investigation Division and Registrar of Societies. The FKF-KFS joint management plans were drafted by the Working Committee. On 1 October 2009 the Registrar of Societies signed the Certificate of Registration for the Friends of Karura Community Forest Association. At the First FKF Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2010 Alice Macaire became FKF's first elected chairperson.\nThe nascent and unique parastatal-stakeholder partnership took its first major management decision on 25 Feb 2010 when FKS and FKF signed an MOU concerning installation and operation of an electric fence to fully secure the forest perimeter. FKF raised the necessary funds and the fence was completed in September. In December 2010 the Strategic Management Plan signed by KFS Director D.K, Mbugua, and on 26\u201327 February 2011 there was a Grand Opening Ceremony in the forest to celebrate a Karura that was now \u2019Secure, Safe & Serene\u2019 and open for visitors.\nAt the second FKF Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2011. Prof. Karanja Njoroge, who had served as Wangari Maathai's deputy at the GreenBelt Movement, was elected to chairmanship of FKF.  Wangari Maathai and Alice Macaire were anointed as honorary Patrons of the Community Forest Association. Cristina Boelcke-Croze continued as vice-chair along with Judge Sharad Rao.\nThus, in only five years, the FKF Community Forest Association in partnership with the Kenya Forest Service and Kenyan corporate and private donors, fenced, secured and transformed Karura \"from the dumping site for hijackers and murderers and illegal private developers\"  into a popular local recreation and conservation site.  From literally zero visitors in 2009, the forest is now welcoming an average of 16,000 visitors a month, 70% of whom are Kenyan citizens. In 2015 there were some 600,000 visitors.A documentary  about the transformation of the forest, \" Rejuvenating The Karura Forest: Danger Spots to Green Haven,\" was produced by Duncan Ndotono and directed by Brenda Okoth,  recognised efforts being made to nurture Karura Forest back to life  \nThe Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association can be contacted at rafiki@karurafriends.org. Website: http://www.friendsofkarura.org\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nKarura Forest is now developed as a visitor's attraction, with some 16,000 entries per month. This includes creation of some 50 km of nature trails for walking, running and biking. The first trail, which is four kilometres long and connects Limuru Road with Old Kiambu Road was opened in May 2009. An electric fence has been built around the forest for security reasons. Although 70% of Karura's visitors are Kenyan citizens, there is a growing appreciation by an international clientele as witnessed by Karura having received a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence for two years running (2014\u201315) and being listed as No. 4 out of 101 Things To Do in Nairobi.The Karura Forest Environmental Education Trust (KFEET) was formed in 2010, and launched by then Minister for Forestry and Wildlife Noah Wekesa. KFEET manages an environmental education centre located in Karura Forest and facilitating access to thousands of Kenyan school children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKenya Forest Service\nFriends of Karura Forest\nKenya Ministry of Wildlife",

        "wiki": "Banana Hill is a suburb of Karuri town, in the eastern part of Kiambu County, Central Province of Kenya. It is in the Africa/Nairobi time zone. Banana Hill's population constitutes 20 percent of the estimated 100,000 residents within the heart of Kiambaa Constituency.\nThe town situated 2,000 m above sea level, approximately 20 km north of Nairobi City via Limuru Road by Runda Estate. It is approachable from an alternate route, the Limuru, Kiambaa/Kiambu and Ndenderu/Redhill all-weather roads. Banana Hill comprises small estates named Banana town, Mombasa, Gacorui, Ndunyu, Miberethi Inana ('Eight Pipes'), and Thimbigwa.\nIts location in the temperate Kenyan Highlands is thought to have been one of the major attractions for its former British colonizers. The area receives an average annual rainfall of 790 mm (31 in) with average temperatures ranging from 48\u201384 \u00b0F in January and 45\u201379 \u00b0F in July. Most mornings and evenings are chilly.\n\n\n== History ==\nBanana Hills was so-named by British Colonial soldiers, locally known as johnnies, who could only see banana plantations as they looked downhill towards the capital city, Nairobi, whenever they drove their military trucks over the hills en route to Limuru. The green scenery has rapidly been replaced with mushroomed red rooftops of mansions as the city of Nairobi spread north.\n\n\n== Landmarks and other features ==\nCoffee farming has been an important revenue source for the Banana Hill area, but has been on the decline as many land owners opt to resort to real-estate and building rentals where global prices for coffee have been in decline. The area is also known for dairy farming; and for horticulture, such as small-scale flower growing, from which a number of families have made livelihoods.\n\n\n=== Banana Hill Art Studio ===\nBanana Hill has world renown as a locale where multiple contemporary artists, The Banana Hill Artists, display and sell their work at the famed Banana Hill Art Studio (see photo). The work-cum-gallery setting was an idea originated by twelve artists in 1992, and has steadily grown into a representation site for the work of nearly four dozen artists.\n\n\n=== Banks, health centre, police station, and post office ===\nBanana Hill features branches of Family Bank Limited (FBL), Postbank, and Kenya Women Finance Trust Ltd. (KWFT), a microfinancing institution.\nKaruri Health Centre is one of the oldest medical centres in the country. It provides outpatient services to area residents, has an 18-bed capacity; and offers maternity services.Anthem healthcare providing speciality clinic services and radiology solutions.\n\nKaruri Police Station.\nKaruri Post office serves the following areas: Nairobi North \u2013 Kangemi, Kikuyu, Githunguri, Nazareth, Limuru, and the Postal Corporation of Kenya, Karuri.\n\n\n=== Churches, faiths, and denominations ===\nThe oldest churches of the Banana Hill area were based on Protestant (primarily Anglican) and Catholic faiths. The major churches of Banana Hill are St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church, Karuri; and member churches of the ACK (Anglican Church of Kenya), such as ACK Emmanuel Church Karuri, ACK Thimbigwa Church, and ACK Banana Hill Church and Restoration victory Ministries International. Within the recent past, many other churches of different denominations have sprung up.\n\n\n=== Schools in and near Banana Hill ===\nPrimary (elementary) schools in the area include Karuri Primary School, Kiambaa Primary School, Msingi Bora Academy; Muthurwa Primary School, Thimbigwa Primary School, and Kibathi Primary School.\nSecondary (high) schools include Karuri High School, Muthurwa High School, Senior Chief Koinange High School; and off Banana-Kiambu Road in Kiambaa, Kiambu District\u2014Banana Hill High School, a private secondary school offering French-language coursework.\nA nearby postsecondary school is Banana Hill Technical Training Institute, in Karuri town.\n\n\n=== Shopping, internet cafes, salons, and entertainment ===\n\nBanana Hill has recently acquired its own identity as a significant shopping district in Kiambaa Division. It has also become an important transport exchange point. The town has hair salons, hardware stores, supermarkets, a good number of entertainment spots; and hosts a number of internet cafes. It also has a large market where farm produce and clothing items are bought and sold; and a large open-air market operating only on Mondays and Thursdays.\n\n\n== Ethnic makeup ==\nBanana Hill is a multi-ethnic, multi-racial town with a reputation for welcoming refugees fleeing from local and international conflict areas, amongst them: Uganda, Mozambique, and South Africa when it was under apartheid rule. It is rumored that Yoweri Museveni, President of Uganda sojourned in Banana Hill during his years in exile. The same has been rumored of the late John Garang, head of the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement, which spearheaded the July 9, 2011, founding of the Republic of South Sudan. Also families of prominent Ugandans like the Late Katunku Nicholas, late Kirya Balaki Kebba Leader of Uganda Freedom Movement fighting group, Adok Nekyon cousin brother of the late President Milton OboteAir force Major Lutaya, Nampenda Philip, Muvule, Wamusi Teddy all lived in Banana hill from 1981-1985 when they went back to Uganda.\n\n\n== Transit and transportation ==\nBanana Hills is a major transit point for passengers traveling to Limuru, Kiambu, Wangige, Kikuyu town and other outlying areas. The use of matatu vehicles (simplified plural, matatus) as primary means of commercial transportatio.. The matatu system relies on use of privately owned vehicles with assigned drives and touts, for which passengers are charged slightly higher fares than for bus travel. Matatus are, essentially, the strongest competition for bus transportation systems and taxi cabs outside of the capital city, and provide essential transportation for large numbers of commuters who work in the capital and large towns, but cannot afford ownership of vehicles. All vehicles used commercially for transportation of goods and passengers must be licensed.\n\n\n== Prominent personalities from Banana Hill ==\nSr. Chief Fredrick Kiniti Njonjo (Rtd.), a  Karuri village Headman before he was promoted and transferred to Makuyu, Murang'a District.He passed away on December 6, 2011.\nGeoffrey Gatama Geturo, a co-founder (with Dr. Geoffrey William Griffin, MBS, OBE and Joseph Kamiru Gikubu, MBS) of Starehe Boys' Centre and School.\nGideon Waweru Gathunguri, founder and owner of the Banana Hill Studios, with branches in various towns in Kenya.

        "wiki": "Gyeongbokgung (Korean: \uacbd\ubcf5\uad81; Hanja: \u666f\u798f\u5bae), also known as Gyeongbokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace, was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located in northern Seoul, South Korea. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon.\nGyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592\u20131598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares. \nThe architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.\nIn the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan. Since then, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. Today, the palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces. It also houses the National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nGyeongbokgung was built three years after the Joseon dynasty was founded and it served as its main palace. With Mount Bugak as a backdrop and the Street of Six Ministries (today's Sejongno) outside Gwanghwamun Gate, the main entrance to the palace, Gyeongbokgung was situated in the heart of the Korean capital city. It was steadily expanded before being reduced to ashes during the Japanese invasion of 1592.\nFor the next 273 years the palace grounds were left derelict until being rebuilt in 1867 under the leadership of Regent Heungseon Daewongun. The restoration was completed on a grand scale, with 330 buildings crowded together in a labyrinthine configuration. Within the palace walls were the Outer Court (oejeon), offices for the king and state officials, and the Inner Court (naejeon), which included living quarters for the royal family as well as gardens for leisure. Within its extensive precincts were other palaces, large and small, including Junggung (the Queen's residence) and Donggung (the Crown Prince's residence).\nDue to its status as the symbol of national sovereignty, Gyeongbokgung was extensively damaged during the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century. In 1911, ownership of land at the palace was transferred to the Japanese Governor-General. In 1915, on the pretext of holding an exhibition, more than 90% of the buildings were torn down. Following the exhibition, the Japanese leveled whatever still remained and built their colonial headquarters, the Government-General Building (1916\u201326), on the site. Only a handful of iconic structures survived, including the Throne Hall and Gyeonghoeru Pavilion.\nRestoration efforts have been ongoing since 1990. The Government-General Building was removed in 1996 and Heungnyemun Gate (2001) and Gwanghwamun Gate (2006-2010) were reconstructed in their original locations and forms. Reconstructions of the Inner Court and Crown Prince's residence have also been completed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 14th\u201416th centuries ===\n\nGyeongbokgung was originally constructed in 1394 by King Taejo, the first king and the founder of the Joseon dynasty, and its name was conceived by an influential government minister named Jeong Do-jeon. Afterwards, the palace was continuously expanded during the reign of King Taejong and King Sejong the Great. It was severely damaged by fire in 1553, and its costly restoration, ordered by King Myeongjong, was completed in the following year.\nHowever, four decades later, the Gyeongbokgung Palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasions of Korea of 1592-1598. The royal court was moved to the Changdeokgung Palace. The Gyeongbokgung palace site was left in ruins for the next three centuries.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1867, during the regency of Daewongun, the palace buildings were reconstructed and formed a massive complex with 330 buildings and 5,792 rooms. Standing on 4,657,576 square feet (432,703 square meters) of land, Gyeongbokgung again became an iconic symbol for both the Korean nation and the Korean royal family. In 1895, after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong by Japanese agents, her husband, Emperor Gojong, left the palace. The Imperial Family never returned to Gyeongbokgung.\n\n\n=== 20th\u201421st centuries ===\n\nIn 1915, it was used as the site for the Joseon Industrial Exhibition with new exhibition buildings being erected in the grounds.Starting from 1911, the colonial government of the Empire of Japan systemically demolished all but 10 buildings during the Japanese occupation of Korea and hosted numerous exhibitions in Gyeongbokgung. In 1926, the government constructed the massive Japanese General Government Building in front of the throne hall, Geunjeongjeon, in order to eradicate the symbol and heritage of the Joseon dynasty. Gwanghwamun Gate, the main and south gate of Gyeongbokgung, was relocated by the Japanese to the east of the palace. A further exhibition, the Chosun Exhibition, followed in 1929.The palace faced further damage when the wooden structure of the relocated Gwanghwamun Gate was completely destroyed amid the devastation of the Korean War.\nGyeongbokgung's original 19th-century palace buildings that survived both the Japanese rule of Colonial Korea and the Korean War include: \n\nGeunjeongjeon (the Imperial Throne Hall) \u2014 National Treasure No. 223.\nGyeonghoeru Pavilion \u2014 National Treasure No. 224.\nHyangwonjeong Pavilion; Jagyeongjeon Hall; Jibokjae Hall; Sajeongjeon Hall; and Sujeongjeon Hall.Modern archaeological surveys have brought 330 building foundations to light.\n\n\n==== Restoration ====\n\nIn 1989, the South Korean government started a 40-year initiative to rebuild the hundreds of structures that were destroyed by the colonial government of the Empire of Japan, during the period of occupied Colonial Korea (1910-1945).\nIn 1995, the Japanese General Government Building, after many controversial debates about its fate, was demolished in order to reconstruct Heungnyemun Gate and its cloisters. The National Museum of Korea, then located on the palace grounds, was relocated to Yongsan-gu in 2005.\nBy the end of 2009, it was estimated that approximately 40 percent of the structures that were standing before the Japanese occupation of Korea were restored or reconstructed.  As a part of phase 5 of the Gyeongbokgung restoration initiative, Gwanghwamun, the main gate to the palace, was restored to its original design.  Another 20-year restoration project is planned by the South Korean government to restore Gyeongbokgung to its former status.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\n\n=== Main Gates of Gyeongbokgung ===\nGwanghwamun (\uad11\ud654\ubb38, The Main and South Gate)\nHeungnyemun (\ud765\ub840\ubb38, The Second Inner Gate)\nGeunjeongmun (\uadfc\uc815\ubb38, The Third Inner Gate)\nSinmumun (\uc2e0\ubb34\ubb38, The North Gate)\nGeonchunmun (\uac74\ucd98\ubb38, The East Gate)\nYeongchumun (\uc601\ucd94\ubb38, The West Gate)\n\n\n=== Oejeon (\uc678\uc804, Outer Court) ===\nGeunjeongmun (\uadfc\uc815\ubb38, The Third Inner Gate)\nGeunjeongjeon (\uadfc\uc815\uc804, The Throne Hall)\nSajeongjeon (\uc0ac\uc815\uc804, The Executive Office)\nSujeongjeon (\uc218\uc815\uc804)\nCheonchujeon (\ucc9c\ucd94\uc804)\nManchunjeon (\ub9cc\ucd98\uc804)\n\n\n=== Naejeon (\ub0b4\uc804, Inner Court) ===\nGangnyeongjeon (\uac15\ub155\uc804, The King's Quarters)\nGyotaejeon (\uad50\ud0dc\uc804, The Queen's Quarters)\nJagyeongjeon (\uc790\uacbd\uc804, The Queen Dowager's Quarters)\n\n\n=== Donggung (\ub3d9\uad81, Palace of the Crown Prince) ===\nJaseondang (\uc790\uc120\ub2f9, The Crown Prince's and Princesses' Quarters)\nBihyeongak (\ube44\ud604\uac01, The Study of the Crown Prince)\n\n\n=== Pavilions ===\nGyeonghoeru (\uacbd\ud68c\ub8e8, The Royal Banquet Hall)\nHyangwonjeong (\ud5a5\uc6d0\uc815)\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\nYeongjegyo (\uc601\uc81c\uad50)Having passed through the initial main gate (Gwanghwamun Gate, \uad11\ud654\ubb38) and secondary gate (Heungnyemun Gate, \ud765\ub840\ubb38), visitors would pass over a small bridge named Yeongjegyo (\uc601\uc81c\uad50). Located on the top of the canal right next to the bridge were several imaginary creatures known as Seosu. \n\nChwihyanggyo (\ucde8\ud5a5\uad50)Chwihyanggyo was originally located on the north side of the island and was the longest bridge constructed purely of wood during the Joseon Dynasty; however, it was destroyed during the Korean War. The bridge was reconstructed in its present form on the south side of the island in 1953.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Gwanghwamun ===\n\nGwanghwamun (Korean: \uad11\ud654\ubb38; Hanja: \u5149\u5316\u9580) is the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace.\n\n\n=== Geunjeongjeon ===\n\nGeunjeongjeon (Korean: \uadfc\uc815\uc804; Hanja: \u52e4\u653f\u6bbf), also known as Geunjeongjeon Hall, is the throne hall where the king formally granted audiences to his officials, gave declarations of national importance, and greeted foreign envoys and ambassadors during the Joseon dynasty.  The building was designated as Korea's National Treasure No. 223 on January 8, 1985. \nGeunjeongmun (Korean: \uadfc\uc815\ubb38; Hanja: \u52e4\u653f\u9580), aligned and located directly to the south of Geunjeongjeon, is the main gate to the courtyard and to Geunjeongjeon. The gate is divided into three separate aisles, and only the king was allowed to walk through the center.\nGeunjeongjeon was originally constructed in 1395 during the reign of King Taejo, but was burned down in 1592 when the Japanese invaded Korea. The present building was built in 1867 when Gyeongbokgung was being reconstructed. The name Geunjeongjeon, created by the minister Jeong Do-jeon, means \"diligent governance hall\".\n\nConstructed mainly of wood, Geunjeongjeon sits on the center of a large rectangular courtyard, on top of a two-tiered stone platform. This two-tiered platform is lined with detailed balustrades and is decorated with numerous sculptures depicting imaginary and real animals, such as dragons and phoenixes. The stone-paved courtyard is lined with two rows of rank stones, called pumgyeseok (Korean: \ud488\uacc4\uc11d; Hanja: \u54c1\u968e\u77f3), indicating where the court officials are to stand according to their ranks.  The whole courtyard is fully enclosed by wooden cloisters.\n\n\n=== Sajeongjeon ===\n\nSajeongjeon (Korean: \uc0ac\uc815\uc804; Hanja: \u601d\u653f\u6bbf), also called Sajeongjeon Hall, is a building used as the main executive office by the king during the Joseon Dynasty. Located behind Geunjeongjeon Hall, the king carried out his executive duties and held meetings with the top government officials in Sajeongjeon.\nTwo separate side buildings, Cheonchujeon (Korean: \ucc9c\ucd94\uc804; Hanja: \u5343\u79cb\u6bbf) and Manchunjeon (Korean: \ub9cc\ucd98\uc804; Hanja: \u842c\u6625\u6bbf), flank the west and east of Sajeongjeon, and while Sajeongjeon is not equipped with a heating system, these buildings are equipped with Ondols for their use in the colder months.\n\n\n=== Gyeonghoeru ===\n\nGyeonghoeru (Korean: \uacbd\ud68c\ub8e8; Hanja: \u6176\u6703\u6a13), also known as Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, is a hall used to hold important and special state banquets during the Joseon Dynasty. It is registered as Korea's National Treasure No. 224 on January 8, 1985.\nThe first Gyeonghoeru was constructed in 1412, the 12th year of the reign of King Taejong, but was burned down during the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592. The present building was constructed in 1867 (the 4th year of the reign of King Gojong) on an island of an artificial, rectangular lake that is 128 m wide and 113 m across.\nConstructed mainly of wood and stone, Gyeonghoeru has a form where the wooden structure of the building sits on top of 48 massive stone pillars, with wooden stairs connecting the second floor to the first floor. The outer perimeters of Gyeonghoeru are supported by square pillars while the inner columns are cylindrical; they were placed thus to represent the idea of Yin & Yang. When Gyeonghoeru was originally built in 1412, these stone pillars were decorated with sculptures depicting dragons rising to the sky, but these details were not reproduced when the building was rebuilt in the 19th century.  Three stone bridges connect the building to the palace grounds, and corners of the balustrades around the island are decorated with sculptures depicting twelve Zodiac animals.\nGyeonghoeru used to be represented on the 10,000 won Korean banknotes (1983-2002 Series).\n\n\n=== Sujeongjeon ===\n\nSujeongjeon (Korean: \uc218\uc815\uc804; Hanja: \u4fee\u653f\u6bbf), a building located to the south of Gyeonghoeru, was constructed in 1867 and used by the cabinet of the Joseon dynasty.\n\n\n=== Gangnyeongjeon ===\n\nGangnyeongjeon  (Korean: \uac15\ub155\uc804; Hanja: \u5eb7\u5be7\u6bbf), also called Gangnyeongjeon Hall, is a building used as the king's main residing quarters. First constructed in 1395, the fourth year of King Taejo, the building contains the king's bed-chamber. Destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592, the building was rebuilt when Gyeongbokgung was reconstructed in 1867, but it was again burned down by a major fire in November 1876 and had to be restored in 1888 following the orders of King Gojong.However, when Huijeongdang of Changdeokgung Palace was burned down by a fire in 1917, the Japanese government dismembered the building and used its construction materials to restore Huijeongdang in 1920. Current Gangnyeongjeon was built in 1994, meticulously restoring the building to its original specifications and design.\nGangnyeongjeon consists of corridors and fourteen rectangular chambers, each seven chambers located to the left and right side of the building in a layout out like a checkerboard. The king used the central chamber while the court attendants occupied the remaining side chambers to protect, assist, and to receive orders. The building rests on top of a tall stone foundation, and a stone deck or veranda is located in front of the building.\nThe noted feature of the building is an absence of a top white roof ridge called yongmaru (Korean: \uc6a9\ub9c8\ub8e8) in Korean. Many theories exist to explain the absence, of which a prominent one states that, since the king was symbolized as the dragon during the Joseon dynasty, the yongmaru, which contains the letter dragon or yong (\u9f8d), cannot rest on top of the king when he is asleep.\n\n\n=== Gyotaejeon ===\n\nGyotaejeon (Korean: \uad50\ud0dc\uc804; Hanja: \u4ea4\u6cf0\u6bbf), also called Gyotaejeon Hall, is a building used as the main residing quarters by the queen during the Joseon Dynasty.  The building is located behind Gangnyeongjeon, the king's quarters, and contains the queen's bed chamber. It was first constructed in around 1440, the 22nd year of King Sejong the Great.King Sejong, who was noted to have a frail health later in his reign, decided to carry out his executive duties in Gangnyeongjeon, where his bed-chamber is located, instead of Sajeongjeon. Since this decision meant many government officials routinely needed to visit and intrude Gangnyeongjeon, King Sejong had Gyotaejeon built in consideration of his wife the queen's privacy.The building was burned down in 1592 when the Japanese invaded Korea, but was reconstructed in 1867. Nevertheless, when Daejojeon of Changdeokgung Palace was burned down by a fire in 1917, the Japanese government disassembled the building and recycled its construction materials to restore Daejojeon.  The current building was reconstructed in 1994 according to its original design and specifications. The building, like Gangnyeongjeon, does not have a top roof ridge called yongmaru.\nAmisan (Korean: \uc544\ubbf8\uc0b0; Hanja: \u5ce8\u5d4b\u5c71), a famous garden created from an artificial mound, is located behind Gyotaejeon. Four hexagonal chimneys, constructed around 1869 in orange bricks and decorative roof tiles, adorn Amisan without showing their utilitarian function and are notable examples of formative art created during the Joseon Dynasty.  The chimneys were registered as Korea's Treasure No. 811 on January 8, 1985.\n\n\n=== Hyangwonjeong ===\n\nHyangwonjeong (Korean: \ud5a5\uc6d0\uc815; Hanja: \u9999\u9060\u4ead), or Hyangwonjeong Pavilion, is a small, two-story hexagonal pavilion built around 1873 by the order of King Gojong when Geoncheonggung residence was built to the north within Gyeongbokgung.The pavilion was constructed on an artificial island of a lake named Hyangwonji (Korean: \ud5a5\uc6d0\uc9c0; Hanja: \u9999\u9060\u6c60), and a bridge named Chwihyanggyo (Korean: \ucde8\ud5a5\uad50; Hanja: \u9189\u9999\u6a4b) connects it to the palace grounds. The name Hyangwonjeong is loosely translated as \"Pavilion of Far-Reaching Fragrance\", while Chwihyanggyo is \"Bridge Intoxicated with Fragrance\".The bridge Chwihyanggyo was originally located on the north side of the island and was the longest bridge constructed purely of wood during the Joseon dynasty; however, it was destroyed during the Korean War. The bridge was reconstructed in its present form on the south side of the island in 1953, but is now being relocated to its original location on the north side. The reconstruction is expected to be completed in 2019.\n\n\n=== Jagyeongjeon ===\n\nJagyeongjeon (Korean: \uc790\uacbd\uc804; Hanja: \u6148\u6176\u6bbf), also called Jagyeongjeon Hall, is a building used as the main residing quarters by Queen Sinjeong (Korean: \uc2e0\uc815\uc655\ud6c4; Hanja: \u795e\u8c9e\u738b\u540e), the mother of King Heonjong. First constructed in 1865, it was burned down twice by a fire but was reconstructed in 1888. Jagyeongjeon is the only royal residing quarters in Gyeongbokgung that survived the demolition campaigns of the Japanese government during the Japanese occupation of Korea.\nThe chimneys of Jagyeongjeon are decorated with ten signs of longevity to wish for a long life for the late queen, while the west walls of the Jagyeongjeon compound are adorned with floral designs. The protruding southeast part of Jagyeongjeon, named Cheongyeollu (Korean: \uccad\uc5f0\ub8e8; Hanja: \u6e05\u8b8c\u6a13), is designed to provide a cooler space during the summer, while the northwest part of Jagyeongjeon, named Bokandang (Korean: \ubcf5\uc548\ub2f9; Hanja: \u798f\u5b89\u5802), is designed for the winter months. The eastern part of Jagyeogjeon, named Hyeopgyeongdang (Korean: \ud611\uacbd\ub2f9; Hanja: \u5354\u6176\u5802) and distinguished by the building's lower height, was used by the late queen's assistants.\nThe building and the decorative walls were registered as Korea's Treasure No. 809 on January 8, 1985.\n\n\n=== Jibokjae ===\n\nJibokjae (Korean: \uc9d1\uc625\uc7ac; Hanja: \u96c6\u7389\u9f4b), located next to Geoncheonggung Residence, is a two-story private library used by King Gojong. In 1876, a major fire occurred in Gyeongbokgung Palace, and King Gojong, for a brief period, moved and resided in Changdeokgung Palace. He eventually moved back to Gyeongbokgung in 1888, but he had the pre-existing Jibokjae building disassembled and moved from Changdeokgung to the present location in 1891. Its name, Jibokjae, translates loosely in English as the \"Hall of Collecting Jade\".\nThe building uniquely shows heavy influence of Chinese architecture instead of traditional Korean palace architecture. Its side walls were entirely constructed in brick, a method commonly employed by the contemporary Chinese, and its roof formations, interior screens, and columns also show Chinese influences. Its architecture possibly was meant to give it an exotic appearance.\nJibokjae is flanked by Parujeong (Korean: \ud314\uc6b0\uc815; Hanja: \u516b\u9685\u4ead), an octagonal two-story pavilion, to the left and Hyeopgildang (Korean: \ud611\uae38\ub2f9; Hanja: \u5354\u5409\u5802) to the right. Parujeong was constructed to store books, while Hyeopgildang served as a part of Jibokjae. Both of the buildings are internally connected to Jibokjae.Bohyeondang (Korean: \ubcf4\ud604\ub2f9; Hanja: \u5bf6\u8ce2\u5802) and Gahoejeong (Korean: \uac00\ud68c\uc815; Hanja: \u5609\u6703\u4ead), buildings that also formed a library complex to the south of Jibokjae, were demolished by the Japanese government in the early 20th century.\n\n\n=== Taewonjeon ===\nTaewonjeon (Korean: \ud0dc\uc6d0\uc804; Hanja: \u6cf0\u5143\u6bbf), or Taewonjeon Shrine, is an ancestral shrine originally built in 1868 to house a portrait of King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon dynasty, and to perform rites to the deceased royalties. Completely destroyed by the Japanese government in the early 20th century, the shrine was accurately restored to its former design in 2005.\n\n\n=== Donggung ===\n\nDonggung (Korean: \ub3d9\uad81; Hanja: \u6771\u5bae), located south of the Hyangwonjeong pavilion, were the living quarters for the crown prince and his wife. The four main buildings of the compound were Jaseondang and Bihyeongak, Chunbang (the lecture hall, where the prince received the preparatory education in order to become a future monarch), as well as Gyebang (the security building).\nIn the 19th century, the future Emperor Sunjong lived in the compound. Donggung was razed to the ground during the Japanese occupation. The restoration work was started in 1999, and currently, only Jaseondang and Bihyeongak were restored.\n\n\n=== Geoncheonggung ===\n\nGeoncheonggung (Korean: \uac74\uccad\uad81; Hanja: \u4e7e\u6df8\u5bae), also known as Geoncheonggung Residence, was a private royal residence built by King Gojong within the palace grounds in 1873.King Gojong resided in Geoncheonggung from 1888 and the residence was continuously expanded, but on October 8, 1895, Empress Myeongseong, the wife of King Gojong, was brutally assassinated by the Japanese agents at the residence. Her body was burned and buried near the residence.\nHaunted by the experiences of the incident, the king left the palace in January 1896 and never again returned to the residence. Demolished completely by the Japanese government in 1909, the residence was accurately reconstructed to its former design and open to the public in 2007.\n\n\n=== Governor-General's Residence (dismantled) ===\nThe back garden of Gyeongbokgung used to contain the main part of the Japanese Governor-General's residence, that was built in the early 20th century during the Japanese occupation. With the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, President Syngman Rhee used it as his office and residence. In 1993, after President Kim Young-sam's civilian administration was launched, the Japanese Governor-General's residence in the Cheongwadae compound was dismantled to remove a major symbol of the Japanese colonialism.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nIn 2011 a survey was conducted by the Seoul Development Institute, which included 800 residents and 103 urban planners and architects. 39 percent of residents voted the palace as the most scenic location in Seoul, following Mount Namsan and Han River in the top spots.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nIn a poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors, conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, stated that watching the changing of the guards at the main gate Gwanghwamun is their third favorite activity in Seoul. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held in front of the main gate every hour from 10:00 to 15:00.\nThere are many tourists wearing hanbok while visiting Gyeongbokgung.\nThere are rental shops close to Gyeongbokgung.\nThis year, the number of night tours exclusively for foreigners at Gyeongbokgung Palace will be increased to 14 from 3 last year.\nAt Gyeongbokgung Palace, a program called \u201cSuragan Tasting Sympathy\u201d, you can experience royal food and watch traditional performances.\n\nChanging of the Royal Guard\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nOn selected days from April to October, Gyeongbokgung offers special 'nighttime viewing' sessions from 7PM to 10PM. 4,500 tickets are offered each session which could be reserved online or purchased on-site (ID required).

          "If you ignore the whole place was rebuilt not long ago and hence isn't particularly original (although, of course, rebuilt in its impressive, historical, form) it is definitely worth seeing. Sprawling, busy and imposing it is a must when visiting Seoul.",

          "No exaggeration, you could easily spend 4-5 hours roaming the palace grounds. It's absolutely massive and full of things to explore. Great photo ops all over as well. Normally there's an entrance fee, but I went last week and didn't have to pay anything. One thing to note, when",

          "We spent around an hour here. That was enough. The changing of the guard at the front gate seemed more novel than anything else, with prosthetic facial hair and pauses to allow tourists to pass. Worth a visit whilst in Seoul. Don\u2019t expect to fill a day here though.",
          "Awesome place DEFINITELY get the outfits outside the side gate. Totally worth the 5 bucks and the pictures you take are super cool. Plus all the Koreans laugh at you and it\u2019s fun. Trust me just do it.",
          "Lots of people were using Hanbok (entrance free if you wear it) and taking pictures around the palace. However, there actually wasn't alot of context about the history free to read unless you join a walking tour. So great for pictures, so-so for historical learning.",

        "wiki": "Changdeokgung (Hangul, \ucc3d\ub355\uad81, \u660c\u5fb7\u5bae; literally, \"Prospering Virtue Palace\"), also known as Changdeokgung Palace or Changdeok Palace, is set within a large park in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the \"Five Grand Palaces\" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty (1392\u20131897). As it is located east of Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeokgung\u2014along with Changgyeonggung\u2014is also referred to as the \"East Palace\" (\ub3d9\uad90, \u6771\u95d5, Donggwol).\nChangdeokgung was the most favored palace of many Joseon princes and retained many elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period that were not incorporated in the more contemporary Gyeongbokgung. One such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. It, like the other Five Grand Palaces in Seoul, was heavily damaged during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910\u20131945). Currently, only about 30% of the pre-Japanese structures of the East Palace Complex (Changdeokgung together with Changgyeonggung) survive.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nChangdeokgung was the second palace after Gyeongbokgung which had been established in 1395 as a primary palace. In the midst of strife for the throne between princes and vassals, authority of Gyeongbokgung was deteriorated. King Jeongjong enthroned by Prince Jeong-an (Yi Bang-won, later became King Taejong) moved the capital to Gaegyeong, the one of Goryeo Dynasty, again in 1400 on the pretext of superior geographical features of it, in fact, in order to avert the power struggle. King Taejong (Yi Bang-won) soon taking over the throne returned to Hanseong(present-day Seoul) had a new palace named Changdeokgung instead of Gyeongbokgung because he had killed his half brothers in Gyeongbokgung whose construction was led by Jeong Do-jeon, the king's rival before. Construction of Changdeok Palace began in 1405, and was completed in 1412. King Seonjo expanded the palace grounds by about 500,000 square meters, including Huwon (see below).\nThe Palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609 by King Seonjo and King Gwanghaegun. The palace burnt down again in 1623 because of King Injo a political Revolt against Gwanghaegun. The palace was also attacked by the Manchu Qing but throughout its history of reconstruction and repair has remained faithful to its original design. Changdeokgung was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868, when the neighboring Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt. Korea's last Emperor, Sunjong lived here until his death in 1926. Other members of the former Royal family were permitted to live in parts of the palace such as former Crown Prince Yi Un who lived in the Nakseon- jae (hall) Buildings with his wife Princess Bangja and sister Princess Deokhye until their respective deaths; this arrangement was periodically interrupted by differing Presidential orders supporting and objecting to their use of the historic facilities. The son of Yi-Un, Yi-Gu also lived in the Palace for variant intervals prior to moving to semi-permanent residence in Tokyo due to mental health issues having been unable to fully adapt to the new Korea.\nToday there are 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens, occupying 110 acres (45 hectares) in all and the area is designated as Historical Site No. 122. Buildings of note include Donhwamun (built in 1412, rebuilt in 1607, with a copper bell weighing 9 short tons or 8 metric tons), Injeongjeon (main hall), Seongjeongjeon (auxiliary office in the main hall), Huijeongdang (the king's private residence, later used as a conference hall), Daejojeon (living quarters), and Nakseon-jae.\n\n\n== Structures ==\nThe palace was built between Peak Maebong of Mt. Bugaksan in the back and River Geumcheon having flowing in the front influenced by the principle \"baesanimsu\" (\ubc30\uc0b0\uc784\uc218) in Feng Shui theory. Contrary to Gyeongbokgung whose main buildings are arranged in accurate architectural principle, however, buildings in Changdeokgung are disposed more freely without a regular system. Though its structure seems chaotic at a glance, all buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them.\nChangdeokgung consists of governmental area (\uce58\uc870, \u6cbb\u671d, chijo) centering on Injeongjeon and Seonjeongjeon, royal private area (\uce68\uc804, \u5be2\u6bbf, chimjeon, meaning 'a house of king's bedroom'), Nakseonjae area in the east, and Huwon beyond the north hills. Most of major official buildings such as Injeongjeon, main hall of Changdeokgung, Seonjeongjeon, king's office, and many of government offices (\uad90\ub0b4\uac01\uc0ac, \u95d5\u5167\u5404\u53f8, gwollaegaksa) are placed in the front parts of the palace, beyond which there are royal private court  for king and queen. King's houses like Seonjeongjeon, Huijeongdang, and Nakseonjae are surrounded in many folds of buildings and courts in case any outsider break through. The architectural style of Changdeokgung overall features simplicity and frugality because of Confucian ideology.\nStructures of particular interest include:\n\nDonhwamun Gate \u2013 The main palace gate. Built in 1412, Donhwamun has a two-story pavilion-type wooden structure, and is the largest of all palace gates. Donhwamun was burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was restored in 1608.\nGeumcheongyo Bridge  \u2013 Oldest bridge still extant in Seoul. Built 1411.\nInjeongjeon Hall (National Treasure) \u2013 The throne hall of Changdeokgung, it was used for major state affairs including the coronation of a new king and receiving foreign envoys. Originally built in 1405, it was rebuilt in 1610 after being burned down during the 1592 Japanese invasion, and a third time in 1804 after being destroyed by a fire.\nSeonjeongjeon Hall \u2013 An office for ruling officials. The king held daily meetings with ministers, reported on state affairs and seminars here.\nHuijeongdang Hall \u2013 Originally the king's bed chamber, it became his workplace after Seonjeongjeon was deemed too small for conducting routine state affairs. The original Huijeongdang was destroyed by a fire in 1917. The reconstructed structure is completely different from the original due to recent Western influences. Wooden floorboards and carpets, glass windows, and chandeliers can be seen inside the building.\nDaejojeon Hall \u2013 Official residence of the queen. Destroyed by fire in 1917, it was rebuilt with materials taken from Gyeongbokgung. Daejojeon was used as a residence for the last empress of Joseon, allowing us a glimpse into the final years of the royal household of the Joseon Dynasty.\nJuhamnu Pavilion (Kyujanggak) \u2013 Royal libraries stood in this area. State exams were conducted in front of the pavilion on special occasions in presence of the king.\nYeon-gyeongdang Residence \u2013 Built in 1827, it was an audience hall modeled after a typical literati house.\n\n\n=== Huwon ===\n\nBehind the palace lies the 78-acre (32 ha) Huwon (\ud6c4\uc6d0, \u5f8c\u82d1, Rear garden) which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women. The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. There are over 26,000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old. The garden for the private use of the king had been called 'Geumwon' (\uae08\uc6d0, \u7981\u82d1, Forbidden garden) because even high officials were not allowed to enter without the king's permission. It had also been called 'Naewon' (\ub0b4\uc6d0, \u5167\u82d1, 'Inner garden'). Today Koreans often call it 'Biwon' (\ube44\uc6d0, \u79d8\u9662, Secret garden) which derived from the office of same name in the late 19th century. Though the garden had many other names, the one most frequently used through Joseon dynasty period was 'Huwon'.In September 2012, the Buyongjeong pavilion in the garden was re-opened after a year-long restoration project. The pavilion was restored based on the Donggwoldo from 1820, National Treasures of South Korea No. 249.A variety of ceremonies hosted by the king were held in Huwon. In the early period of the Joseon dynasty, military inspections in which the king participated were often held here. King Sejo had troops parade and array before him or commanded them by himself in the garden. In addition, feasts were given, archery tournaments held, and fireworks enjoyed in Huwon.\nThe Ongnyucheon (\uc625\ub958\ucc9c, \u7389\u6d41\u5ddd, \"Jade Stream\") area is of particular interest. It contains a U-shaped water channel carved in 1636 for floating wine cups, with a small waterfall and an inscribed poem on the boulder above it. The area also contains five small pavilions.\n\n\n== World Heritage ==\nChangdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997. The UNESCO committee stated the place was an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\" being exceptional because the buildings are \"integrated into and harmonized with the natural setting\" and adapted \"to the topography and retaining indigenous tree cover.\"Portions of the palace were used to film the hugely popular Korean drama Dae Jang Geum in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Event ==\nFrom April to October 2018, Changdeok Palace will host the 2018 Changdeok Palace moonlight tour. Changdeok Palace moonlight tours are a special time event to experience life in the palace. It takes about two hours and starts at Donhwamun Gate, the main gate of Changdeok Palace, at 8 p.m.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChoi, Jong-deok (\ucd5c\uc885\ub355) (2006), Changdeokgung: the true palace of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \ucc38 \uad81\uad90 \ucc3d\ub355\uad81), Seoul: Nulwa.\nHoon, Shin Young Hoon (2008).

          "I was reluctant first to visit but we give it a try since we came from the Bukchon Hanok Village and I didn't regret visiting the Palace. This gave us the South Korean locale feels. I think the place was so huge that we didn't get the chance to walk around as it's our last day",
          "My son, husband and I decided to visit the Changdeokgung Palace during our visit to Seoul. There are other Palaces in Seoul but we decided to go see this one since it is the only one that is considered a Unesco Heritage site and it's also within walking distance to the Hangbok",
          "If you have little to no knowledge of Korean history (like me), I'd suggest you to take the guided tour. The guide was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. Book your ticket to Secret Garden online and you can book 7 days earlier prior to your visit. I took the last",

          "It\u2019s a nice Palace but having been to a few now in Korea it\u2019s a little tiring. If this is your first Palace then this is a great start but you\u2019ll soon see that all palaces in Korea have the exact same layout and every building has the exact same designs and colours.",

          "To a Westerner there seems little difference between the many palaces of Seoul but Changdeokgung stands out because of the beautiful Secret Garden tour. When you finish the tour the gate to Changgyeonggung is just on your left - not as interesting but worth a quick look if you",

          "The palace grounds are quite extensive with large ponds and a separate garden area which costs extra but worth seeing. Initially you have a guide but you can leave the group to look around on your own if you want.",

          "Beautiful! Definitely worth walking around for a bit - especially since it's so close to Bukchon Hanok Village, Insa-dong, etc. Didn't do the secret garden tour, but wish I had. Gorgeous colors, as is typical with Korean architecture.",
          "Beautifully restored palace that is worth a visit. Be prepared for a lot of walking, a lot of steps - so this isn't necessarily great for someone who is challenged with either. But otherwise, it's great to visit and be able to wander at your own pace through all the buildings",
          "This is like a smaller version of the main palace in Beijing. It is designed very similarly, though a little smaller. The buildings were rebuilt after the Japanese occupation from 1910-1935, when it was torn down. They actually had underground heating before the Chinese did.",

          "I hired the traditional \u201chanbok\u201d dress to wear to the palace and get nice photos. This place is perfect for photos and the architecture and history is beautiful. Wearing the traditional dress made it more surreal and it really felt like you were there. It is a huge place so",

          "I came here around 9.30 am and it wasn't crowded. The entrance ticket is 3000 Won for palace only and 5000 Won if it's include the ''Secret Garden'' area. The design is not too different with Gyeongbokgung Palace but nice to spend some time here.",
          "Well for my opinion after I have been to Gyeongbokgung the shape of the building look similar design. It's very nice to walk around the garden right next to the palace wall.",

          "This is an excellent large site with some nicely restored buildings. It looks particularly good in April with the cherry blossom and the azaleas. The visit to the Secret Garden is the icing on the cake, although my visit was marred by the group being too large, with young people",
          "Caveat to this review is I\u2019ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out. What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly",
          "Never been to a Palace before. But this place is worth the visit. The area is just so vast and you can see a lot of tourists on their hanbok dresses.",
          "This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage.",

          "If you only have time for ONE palace, choose this one. It is more expansive -- has more trees and more structures. Better to book the secret garden tour ahead (esp. if you prefer the English tour) so that you plan your visit accordingly.",
          "Lots of building but all of the same decor, A lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese and been refurbished. Still worth a walk around expect to spend around an hour. Changdeokgung place is adjacent to Changgyonggung Place with an inter connecting gate, there is an",
          "We decided to stroll through the gardens in full Hanbok. We rented them from the little shop across the traffic lights from the front gate. 15000KW for 2 hours. We then wandered the palace grounds (free entry) taking pictures. We were also asked to be in many other pictures",

          "This is a lovely palace to walk around. Lots of things to see. It will only take you about and hour. You can dress up in national costume if you like, at a cost of course. Pretty gardens as well.",
          "Nearly didn\u2019t come as we were already so tired from previous days including an earlier visit to Gyeongbokgung. Boy, am I glad I came! This to me is more beautiful and felt more authentic than Gyeongbokgung. As there were less visitors , we were able to wander around quietly at",

          "If you\u2019re into temples, palaces, history, parks, or a slower pace, head over to Changdeokgung Palace. Surrounded by modern skyscrapers, the palace built in 1405 feels like a time machine once you step through the large gates. The old architectural features have been maintained",

          "Not much to see. Buildings from yesterday, almost nothing is original, everything rebuilt in the last years... it is just worthed because what happened arround there... no interest",
          "Nice place to stroll and check Korean architecture. You can follow the local guide provided by the palace if you want to understand more. Many girls rent Korean traditional dresses for selfies here.",
          "I wanted an English tour of the Secret Garden at 10.30 am. Limited number of tickets, only 50 per tour. Since I found it difficult to book online I went to Anguk station by metro and reached the ticket booth at 8.45 am. They open at 9. Only a few other people were there so I",
          "Changdeokgung palace is the 2nd palace of the Joseon Dynasty, the architecture is not as grand and stately as Gyeongbokgung palace, the main palace. However, the highlight is the secret garden. Occupying 60% of the entire palace ground, it's lot more than a garden. It has many",
          "I love this place. I learned a lot about their culture. In fact, the scenery inside there is so great.",

          "We had a nice guided tour with a good English speaking guide, very interesting history and amazing blue ceramic tile roofing",

          "This isn\u2019t the main palace but I believe to be the most scenic of them all. Definite must do is to take the guided tour of the Secret Garden which is the real jewel here. It is an extra 5000 won but it is really beautiful and you gain a good sense of history. They don\u2019t allow",
          "I would recommend the secret garden tour, but there\u2019s steep hills and stairs so don\u2019t take the elderly here! Don\u2019t expect lots of flowers but more serene forested areas with native trees which are also nice",

Make sure you visit the Secret Garden but plan the timing as you need to join a guided tour. It\u2019s 10,000 Won for the full package and it\u2019s",
          "With all of the Hanbok traditional clothing rented out to visitors it feels a bit like a time machine ... well except for all the cell phones. One can picture yourself there hundreds of years in the past. Certainly added to the full experience.",
          "I really enjoyed Changdeokgung - it didn't feel as crowded as Gyeongbokgung and the Secret Garden Tour was such a treat! Definitely worth going into if you want a more relaxed atmosphere of exploring how the emperors and empresses lived!",
          "The grounds of this palace are quite extensive and walking through it on a very hot day proved to be a challenge. For us, it was one of the top things to do - but do pick a coolish day if you can!",
          "Changdeokgung Palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty palaces located in Seoul, Korea. While not as large in scale as the main Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung boasts its own unique features such as being built with a closer to nature theme in mind. The buildings here tend to be",

          "I went on the Secret Garden tour in Changdeokgung Palace and it was a real disappointment. The gardens themselves were pretty but what could have been done in 30 minutes max was dragged out to 60 minutes with lots of \u201chave 15 minutes to look around\u201d moments. Our guide (CJ I",

          "Entrance to the Changdeokgung Palace costed 3000 wons, but the Secret Garden could only be admitted by joining a 5,000 won tour at the entrance. Tourists are only allowed to tour the garden with the Guide. We visited in July and joined a Chinese tour at 12:30pm. The Garden",
          "Worth having a look at. Not a lot to see. You can buy a ticket which allows you entrance to all the palaces here. The main attraction is the secret garden. Not really what I would call a garden but a walk through a forest with a guide which was quite interesting.",
          "The palace is somewhat small, as the building are all rebuilt to resembles the original structure, looks too good order to be a 600 year old historical site. However, it\u2019s a good mock up to know the history of Korea. A small palace, not really too much to see. King\u2019s life",
          "A smaller Palace and a quiet one; not too crowded. The Secret Gardens of this Palace is the main attraction and are not to be missed out. The tour to the Secret Garden is a conducted by a Palace tour guide and these start on specific timings (please check at the ticket counter)",

          "Great atmosphere. Nice canteen, museum well displayed and plenty of photo opportunities with locals strolling around in traditional clothes.",
          "One of 4 palaces in Seoul and I would say in terms of scale the most magnificent one. However, all of the buildings are either closed or empty inside. Are the ancient Koreans sitting around in an empty room all the time? I'm not sure, but the experience could of been greatly",

          "entrance fee: 3,000 won for entering Changdeokgung Palace (free if dress up in Hanbok); another 5,000 won for entering Secret Garden, booking may be required. No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing",
          "Definitely worth going to see. The whole complex is great. I would recommend visiting if you\u2019re unsure.",
          "Beautiful attraction right in the middle of the town. Wonderfully kept gardens and ancient buildings. Museum of Contemporary Art is also on site, and the entrance fee for both attractions is very cheap.",
          "There is a lot here, and there is no way I'd appreciate this place if I just walked up independently. We went on a private guided tour, and it was magnificent. There are a lot of details that we would have missed if we did it on our own. Totally worth the time to see this",

          "Interesting contrast to the more linear layout of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, with buildings following the gradient of the land. Plan an additional 90mins for the guided tour of the Secret Garden (additional entry fee, check tour times). Easy walk between Gyeongbokgung and",
          "Beautiful ancient architectures and gardens. This will make you think how those people 600 years ago then were so intelligent even without the technologies we have today. Remember to take lots of photos with such beautiful scenery. You will not fail to notice lots of beautiful",
          "We went to see the secret garden English tour which took about 90 minuets. There were about 50 people together. A guide was explaining about each spots in the garden and it was very interesting!! It was such a bloody hot day so it\u2019s better to bring some water with you if you",

          "It was really cold the day we went but it was worth it. Would like to go back in the spring season to see The Secret Garden again. A must see if you like history and seeing such a peaceful place among all those skyscrapers.",
          "We went June 2018. Got the tickets for the secret garden tour the same day. Highly recommend the secret garden tour. It's the prettiest area. The landscaping is very pretty. Took us about 4 hours to tour the palace. Much longer than I anticipated. Many tourists dressed in",
          "This royal complex including the palace and surroundings definitely worths a visit. It is representative of korean imperial period, but it is much smaller and simpler than their chinese counterparts.",
          "A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving",
          "This was a great place to tour in and around, and I found that I could learn a great deal about Korean history as a result.It was a day of perfect weather with rippling cerulean blue skies outside and that just added to the ambience.",
          "Clean and gorgeous. We did the secret garden tour here as there is no other way to explore the gardens",

          "For history lovers ,what can be better than visiting a palace dating back to about 800 years ago? The area is wide and so many houses and rooms are located in this area.you had better to study some of it's history if you want to visit without a tour leader.",
          "It is pretty empty but just have an idea of Korean royalty living style way back when. Beautiful timber and was popular for wedding photos. Entrance fees was cheap too.",
          "This is my college roommate's favorite palace, so this is the sole palace I visited. I especially loved watching the girls, mostly, in traditional hanbok taking selfies and photo shoots. I was able to witness the changing of the guard, and partook in the tea and traditional",
          "Went on a guided tour here and I felt it helps to better understand and enjoy the sights in Changdeokgung. It was less crowded than Gyeongbokgung when I was there. Nice to put on hanbok and take colourful photos! (By the way, admission was free since we wore hanbok!)",
          "It was easy to travel too by tube/metro and easy to find. The entrance fee was very reasonable and and although busy it was far from crowded (un-like some attractions in Japan). There was only a small cafe/refreshments area, especially relevant for us as it was a bright hot day.",
          "Smack in the middle of Seoul, this oasis makes you feel like you are far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The palaces are very well preserved and the gardens are just beautiful. Every day at 3:00 and 4:30 pm there is a tour of the Secret Garden which you cannot enter",
          "Its history in the middle of the city. Nice place to walk around and its a really big place. The weather was good. Watched the changing of guards at 2pm and it was a nice thing to see.",
          "one of the most impressive and beautifully preserved structures displacing the 1400's architecture in downtown Seoul.. The changing of the guard ceremony is also rich and impressive,",
          "Must see at least one of the palaces when visiting Seoul. This one is pretty huge. Not too crowded and the audio guide was pretty informative.",
          "Nice palace to spend the afternoon walking around. The buildings have been freshly painted and look gorgeous.",
          "Came here to have a look at the palace and especially, the guard changing ceremony. Located quite near City Hall metro station. Guard changing at 11am and lasted just a short while before the whole ceremony repeats again. There is a small booth for a quick free hanbok rental",
          "Changdeokgung is conveniently located close to downtown Seoul, just a short walk from Insadong. If you're only going to visit one palace in Seoul, I suggest Gyeongbokgung since there's more to see but Changdeokgung is also a very nice place to escape the hurried athmosphere of",
          "I went later in the day so I missed the last Secret Garden tour gog foreigners, it turns out you're not allowed on your own and in my opinion without the secret garden it's good but not great. The gift shop had some great items at very low cost!",
          "We went for the 10:30am Secret Garden tour on a hot June day. We find the tour a bit slow for our pace. The garden itself was alright. However, we find that the morning/noon sun was quite draining. And there were some uphill and downhill that we need to climb. It might be",
          "Beautiful, very interesting and so well preserved! I spent several hours here, despite the severe June heat and humidity and was absolutely fascinated by the history of the palace - highly recomended",
          "Wanted to visit gyeongbokgung but it was closed on a tuesday, so we settled for this instead. Free admission if you wear Hanbok. Not as pretty as Gyeongbokgung in my opinion and after awhile every part looks the same. Nevertheless, we still took some pretty photos in our hanbok.",
          "We went to see this palace built during Joseon dynasty and the palace was a reminder of great design work at that time. You need to go to Anguk station exit 3 and walk about 450 to 500 m, please follow the sign to find this palace",
          "It\u2019s nice place clean and so peaceful and beautiful garden to walk can be romantic as well many young people\u2019s hangout in weekend and wear Korea customized outfits they look so beautiful too been here many times but still love it",
          "Visited during autumn. Very memorable.. Didn't expect it to be a small palace but worth taking a stroll and looking at the beautiful autumn leaves and lake. There is a truck selling red bean cakes outside the palace.. So delicious!",
          "You can just picture how the royal family lived there. Take a few hours to wonder around and discover all the corners of this beautiful palace. The secret garden is also worth a visit!",

          "I didn't even see the entire palace, because it is enormous. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking. The architecture is simply a wow, and the restoration work keeps the vibrancy alive. Two things that stood out: the portrait gallery with it's haunting",
          "The palace is nice but in my opinion the Secret Garden is the highlight. Unfortunately you can only visit it as part of tour but it's worth it.",
          "We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session. I was delighted to be granted free access being a 'Senior",
          "It\u00b4s such a beautiful palace with an extraordinary design. You need to walk around in any corner you can, it worth it. Prepare your camera to take some photos, wear sneakers and an umbrella if it is raining.",
          "It is worth booking ahead to do the secret garden palace tour. As has been mentioned in other reviews, it\u2019s a relatively hilly landscape so I noticed that older attendees didn\u2019t complete all of the walk. The palace is large and pretty and the gardens lovely (it was just",

          "Was a scorcher the afternoon we went and we really felt the heat and the crowd! Your bus after your bus come to the palace as well as domestic tourists alike. The palace is nice to walk around, would suggest waalking shoes as the paths are cobbled or sandy. It is quite",
          "This palace boasts a forest garden where pavilions, buildings and resting spaces are all integrated with Korea's forest plants. The garden is only accessed via guided tours, which is understandable in a way, since you don't want visitors picking flowers or dabbling their feet in",
          "I think if you visit Seoul, you have to go to one of the palaces. We went on a busy, sunny, weekend and it was very enjoyable. There's lots of places to walk around, and it's much different from the palaces and castles back home. Rent a hanbok!!! There're loads of places",
          "Ok so you will probably end up at Gyeongbokgung since it's the 'main' palace. But once inside, it's nice, not great. Changdeokgung is without a doubt the better of the two. Most friends and family who come to Korea also agree. It's not symmetric, but it's a lot more peaceful,",
          "This was an interesting place to visit, but most important is to get on the guided tour where they walk you through the gardens and explain some of the history and background. This was the best part.",
          "Very quiet place to visit as compare to other palace in the area. Good location to take any photograph",
          "wear hanbok and take instagramable pictures. Go to Gyeongbukgung first before here. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall. Moreover , there are english and mandarin tours to",

          "Although I very much appreciated the chance to see the heritage sites, there is too much concrete re-working for it to feel totally authentic.",
          "The Changdeokgung Palace is very popular in late March/ early April as the cherry blossoms flourish. The most popular spot is in front of the Secret Garden entrance where visitors pose for photos. The palace is easy to go. I usually walk from Insa-dong to the palace within",
          "I think if you have done much travelling in Asia this site may not live up to expectations. Yes, the grounds are huge but there isn\u2019t really a lot to see. There are very few building that are open, and most that are aren\u2019t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the",
          "This place is renovated it was built long time ago but had some kind of destruction after couple of wars and they rebuilt it again You need to have someone with you to explain what is in there otherwise you wouldn't understand what is the area all about",
          "After seeing 2 other palaces, this one seemed no different. But it was interesting to see how barren their homes used to be and what counted as luxury hundred years ago.",
          "Amazing palace with beautiful architecture. Entry was free with the discover Seoul Pass. We had just come from Gyeongbokgung so this place seemed smaller compared to there. The palaces looked similar on the outside but the decorations here were a bit more colourful. This place",

          "This place has a very huge area and the architecture of the building is stunning. We did not enter the palace area & secret garden as I did not enjoy the weather - it was too cold for me ! But, I will definitely visit again if I have the chance..",
          "The palace is nice, less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and a bit smaller, so I liked this one more. But the main reason I came here was the Secret Garden tour and we were not disappointed. The tour itself provides valuable information for those interested in the history of the",
          "Rent a hanbok, dress up and spend a few hours here. Great free museum, good people watching and the changing of the guard is spectacular and happens every couple of hours. A beautiful piece of history. A small fee for the garden section, if you are over 60 show some ID and get",
          "The real highlight is the secret garden. Do not miss it. So pretty and so worth the tour. In my opinion, far more worth a visit compared to Gyeongbokgung.",
          "I'm not sure which is which, but this pair of palaces and the Secret Garden almost compare in scope to the Forbidden City in Beijing. What they lack in size and grandeur, they make up for in aesthetics. The palace is lovely and verdant. Buy the Royal Pass for a few extra 1000",
          "Changdeokgung Palace is huge. English is on some signs. Rent audio headphones to move at your own pace - the map tells you which number to punch in. They are due at 5pm so return them before you go on the last Secret Garden tour or ask your guide to call ahead. The beautiful SG",
          "There are many stores around that will rent outfits to complete the adventure and take pictures in this impressive place with an appropriate attire. The Palace is just like any other palace in Asia, which is not bad but not necessarily something to look for if you've been to",
          "Amazing culture and history. The palaces /temples are amazing. Love to see all the local wearing their traditional clothes to visit the place. If you plan to visit make sure you have a lot of time to explore (like a morning) really worth it and the place is huge, lots of easy",

          "Two weeks ago we visited this Palace and Secret Garden on a guided tour. It was a highlight of our holiday. The tour guide gave us a glimpse of what life would have been like and was well prepared with answers to any questions. The secret garden does involve a hill climb that",
          "This palace is the most beautiful one in Seoul. If you have to pick one among the many palaces in Seoul, pick this one. At best, go in the morning. And it is not so crowded like the Gyeongbokgung. It is also within a walking distance from the Hanok Village.",
          "One of the palaces in Seoul, the palace is a smaller and more quaint one. It is affordable and can be seen in about an hour and a half in its entirety if not more quickly. If I remember correctly, this palace is located near the East Gate and you can see both rather easily",
          "This is much better to take pictures rather than the main palace. The building here has more character and not that many tourists. You have to go here early in the morning to enjoy the place without too much tourists. Btw, I'm just lucky this is walking distance to my",
          "I still think their palaces all look a like. Same colors and desgins but of course, there are differences in structures. You can come to this place then enter the Secret Garden tour as well. This is also walking distance from Insadong so if you are around Insadong, you may drop",

          "I went at 10 am and there were not a lot of people. The palace buildings are nice and there are some beautiful details. Some of the trees were blossoming which gave it a more picturesque aura. When we tried to go to the Secret Garden we realised we can only visit with a tour. So",

          "Wonderfully beautiful in history, tradition and architecture. Many locals opt to rent traditional outfits and come to the Palace to pay their respects. Selfies galore and of course people taking photos of groups and so on. I especially loved the idea that during the week",
          "Well worth a look around, interesting place. I'd suggest include the secret garden as well. Signs are also in English and you can pick up an English leaflet at the entrance. It's a calm place to wander round in the middle of the city madness! There is a coffee shop on site.",

          "I went on Chuseok (Korean thanksgiving). So it was very busy, i would definately go back. As i really think the palace is a very beautiful place to spend sometime.",
          "Tour guide was so knowledgeable. We were taken back in time by her information.",
          "I loved the fried mandu! The others were just okay.",
          "Extremely well maintained palace. The walk aways are labeled so it is easy for someone to tour the whole place using the instructions and signs. Secret Garden is a limited experience. Only a set number of people can tour at once which make the experience a lot better.",
          "I highly recommend paying the 3 dollars for the headset audio tour. I learned a lot and it made visiting the palace 10x more interesting!",
          "Not as interesting as gyeongbokgung\nGood as an alternative",
          "Amazing... I was lucky enough to visit it in spring time and it is beautiful. The blooming trees and bushes, green canopies and amazing architecture all combined to make a must see palace. One of my favorites so far :)",
          "Love it! People are so friendly! Loved my tour guide and the place was just .. breathtaking",
          "It was pretty but might be more interesting with a tour guide explaining its history.",
          "Very nice garden, better than the Main palace since it is not that crowded, also very nice spots for Hanbok Instagram Photos. The Park also feels bigger since there is more \"Nature\". The Secret Garden is only accessable with a Guide. Tip: \u2026",
          "It's one of the King's palace in Seoul. While Gyeongbokgung palace is always crowded with tourists, to get away from the crowd but still get a vibe of a royal palace, this is the perfect place to spend an hour or two at. The palace is huge \u2026",
          "must visit the secret garden. its truly tranquil and a historical home that the royalty lived in before. the recent drama rookie historian was also filmed here. you must prebook the secret garden guided tour via the website in advance.",
          "I did not find it to be as pretty or interesting as the original palace a few miles to the west.  There is a section where a forest like scenic view is, that segment is nice.",
          "One of my best memories of Seoul. This place is beautiful and very clean.\nI loved every second of my visit there.",
          "Rich in history, right in the heart of the metro. People in hanboks makes you feel as if you're back in time.",

          "This is the main place for visiting in Seoul, South Korea. \nVery colourful and authentic. \nLocated in the very center of the city, not far from the museum of Modern Art so,  it's convenient to see both places in one day. \nThe best part of \u2026",
          "Big palace, $3 USD admission, nice views, lots of walking. Takes about 45mins to see everything.",
          "Changdeokgung is smaller than Gyeongbokgun.\nAnd is less traditional.",

          "Worthwhile a visit. Legacy of the past",
          "Nice place to go for a walk and lean a little about Korean culture.",
          "I love Changdeokgung and the rest of the palaces. But, go with the mindset that the palaces won't have a lot of interior space to look at or enter because the Joseon Dynasty built their palaces to be largely outdoor. At every palace, you \u2026",
          "Interesting palace. Secret garden is the main attraction and you have to book a tour before you enter. The tours tend to sell out fast so it is better to book online ir get there early and reserve a tour for later in the day",
          "The Chandeokgung and Huwon Secret Garden Forest are especially beautiful when illuminated at night. Totally different experience from day visit. Do try to plan for their Moonlight Tour, which has access to the Nakseonjae complex and ends with a wonderful traditional arts performance.",
          "Great place, beautiful buildings\nSecret garden was not the thing I expected but still worth looking.\n\nSimilarly to Gyeongbokgung people in traditional Korean outfits creates unique atmosphere.\nIn my opinion this palace is better than Gyeongbokgung.",
          "Beautiful place to enjoy on a nice day. Very educational.",
          "A jewel just in the midst of the bustling streets of the city. Very well preserved.",
          "I would recommend people visit this before gyeongbokgung palace if you're going to try to see both palaces in 1 day. The secret garden tour at Changdeokgung takes 2-3 hours and is totally worth it.\n\nI made the mistake of going to \u2026",
          "Amazing and very big, you need an hour or 2 to walk it and take some pictures. Be sure to be there early and enter the secret garden, they close it at 5:00",
          "The best thing about Changdeokgung is the secret garden located behind the palace itself. \nSeeing just Changdeokgung is a waste. The real experience lies in the garden. \nIt is truly stunning. \n\nThere is guided tours in English in both places. Free.",
          "Nice place to visit.  Is you come dressed in the local ancient costume entrance is free",
          "My fave Palace in Seoul city.. so quite and peaceful..",
          "Very unique and very pretty especially in spring. A must visit, including the nearby Changgyeonggung and Secret Garden. Joining the free guided tour is worthwhile if you really want to learn the history.",

          "Beautiful scenery of temples. It\u2019s very big and there are several entrances. The temples itself are really nice, but look like brand new. You can\u2019t enter any of the buildings, but there are performances during the day. There are also \u2026",

          "Architecturally beautiful and colourful. We didn't get to have as much time to explore as I would have liked but it was still worth it! And if you like taking lots of pictures, it's best to go without the tour and avoid the crowds. Overall really great!",
          "World heritage and best Palace in the world",
          "Love this palace",
          "Lovely time learning ancient Korean history.  It's so big.  Some tourists dress in period costumes, walk around,  & take selfies.  It's a fun & educational experience.  It's important to learn history.",

          "My favorite of the 3 palaces in the immediate area. Less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and has been more preserved over the years. Really beautiful!",
          "Best palace in Seoul, with the secret garden. Buildings were placed in harmony with the nature and not in a row.\nOnly 100 people are allowed to visit the secret garden per hour... It really worths the wait for the landscapes and the guide we got.\nChoose the ticket at 10000 won if you plan to see the other palaces and the secret garden.",

          "Serene garden. Nice to spent an afternoon.",
          "It's amazing experience to  know the history and culture of South Korea",
          "Beautiful palace. If you are thinking about doing the secret garden tour, you should know that it takes about an hour and a half, AND there is alot of walking uphill/downhill on somewhat uneven terrain. It was very interesting though! Our guide was very knowledgeable and funny.",
          "The best palace park in Seoul!",
          "I really loved this place! It isn't too crowded so it's peaceful just like a palace should be in my opinion!",
          "bit overrated; not much to see and not particularly beautiful either. can see whole thing in 25 mins. bathrooms available.",
          "I found this park even more interesting than the more popular Gyeongbokgung Palace. It has many beautiful gardens and similar old architecture. Inside the area is a restricted area which you can access by booking a tour. They run frequent tours in their local language, but just several times per day in the English language.",
          "The National Cultural Festival was going on during our visit. Excellent entertainment. Also learned a little late that if you rent traditional clothing and walk around in it, entrance to the palaces are free!",

Should wear comfortably when you visit.",
          "Palace entrance fee was very cheap! Definitely worth the visit. I recommend spending 500won to pick up a booklet if you are not doing a tour/audio guide. The booklet is filled with information on all major buildings in the palace complex, well worth the 500won.",

          "It's a beautiful place but I recommend going in any season but winter, especially if you want to visit the secret gardens. The general ticket is 3,000won and the ticket for the secret gardens tour is 5,000won but not worth it in winter since the ponds are frozen and the plants look dead. The tour lasts about 70min.",

        "wiki": "The N Seoul Tower (Korean: N\uc11c\uc6b8\ud0c0\uc6cc), officially the YTN Seoul Tower and commonly known as the Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul, South Korea. At 236 metres (774 ft), it marks the second highest point in Seoul.Built in 1971, the N Seoul Tower is South Korea's first general radio wave tower, providing TV and radio broadcasting in Seoul. Currently, the tower broadcasts signals for Korean media outlets, such as KBS, MBC and SBS.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1969 at a cost of approximately US$2.5 million, Namsam tower was opened to the public in 1980. Seoul Tower was completed on December 3, 1971, designed by architects at Jangjongryul though at the time the facility interior was not furnished. It took until August 1975 for the third floor of the observatory deck, museum, open hall, souvenir shop, in addition to bring the other facilities to completion. However, despite finalization of tower construction, the observatory was closed to the public until October 15, 1980. Since then, the tower has been a landmark of Seoul. Tower elevation ranges from 236.7 m (777 ft) at the base to 479.7 m (1,574 ft) above sea level. Seoul Tower had its name changed to N Seoul Tower in 2005 whereas the \"N\" stands for 'new', 'Namsan', and 'nature.' Approximately 15 billion KRW was spent in renovating and remodeling the tower.When N Seoul Tower's original owner merged with CJ Corporation, it was renamed the N Seoul Tower (official name CJ Seoul Tower). It has also been known as the Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower. It is also Korea's first general radio wave tower that holds transmissions antennas of KBS, MBC, SBS TV, FM, PBC, TBS, CBS, and BBS FM.\nSeoul Tower chosen to worldwide travel expert evaluation and reader preferences is registered the world's 500 attractions in research.\n\n\n== Floors & Amenities ==\nThe N Seoul Tower is divided into three main sections, including the N Lobby, N Plaza, and the N Tower.

Namsan to walk to the tower. The tower is renowned as a national landmark and for its cityscape views. The 236.7 m (777 ft) tower sits on the Namsan mountain (243m or 797 ft). It attracts thousands of tourists and locals every year, especially during nighttime when the tower lights up. Photographers enjoy the panoramic view the tower offers. Each year, approximately 8.4 million visit the N Seoul Tower, which is surrounded by many other attractions South Korea offers, including Namsan Park and Namsangol Hanok Village. Visitors may go up the tower for a fee that differs for the following groups: children, elderly and teenagers, and adults. Rates differ for each package and group size.\nIn 2012, surveys conducted by Seoul City revealed foreign tourists ranked the N Seoul Tower as the number one tourist attraction.

          "Good place to visit.Suggest a taxi to the cable car station for a great view over Seoul. Just be aware that if you have anyone affected by flashing lights they might not want to go up the tower. Good post office selling postcards and stamps plus you can mail right away. Remember",
          "Well, it\u2019s a landmark and yes you should see it but I felt a bit let down as I expected more... it\u2019s not bad, but surprisingly little things to see or do for the schlepp....",
          "We took a ride till the tower. It cost 7000 won for one way and 9500 won for round way, but we had to wait about 45 min for a ride, so if you can, just walk there. The way up ist beautiful. The tower stands in the middle of the park, so you can enjoy amazing view. Sometimes",
          "Make sure you get here around 5pm so you can see the sunset! I walked up here via the extensive paths around the park",
          "We stopped here as part of a tour, so we had our own usher who guided us to the elevators. The grounds are pleasant and parts of the old city wall can be seen in various places. The light show at the elevator was a bit much. The top floor with all the windows was filled with",
          "Cool weather and very nice scenery at night at the top of the tower. There is a Japanese restaurant which serve nice and delicious foods too.",
          "It is better to use cable car to go up there because walking is not suitable for OKU, old folks less exercise people. The way to reach N Seoul Tower is too deep. Unfortunately, the day i reached N Seoul Tower, the cable car is on maintenance so we need to go up and down by foot.",
          "Rode the cable car to the top, fun ride and such lovely view. the N Seoul Tower experience was even better, unbelievable view and a great experience. Took the seoul city tour package",
          "We stopped here as part of the hop on/hop off tour so the cable car and trip to the top was included. I recommend doing all of it! The views were stunning. We travelled with a toddler and she also loved it.",
          "Went up and down on the cable car and had the buffet dinner. Went at dusk so got to see the night lights too.My hubby likes towers so every city we go to, we go up any tall building that allows us to. Lotte tower was another good one.",
          "Had a great time on a not bad day when visibility was okay. Lots of walking even with a lift to the station then cable ride to to the tower. Buy or bring couples lock and add to the collection.",
          "I went twice during the trip, one night trip for buffet dinner and food is not bad and view is awesome. One day trip close to sunset. Both day and night trip is awesome and I love the view and Seoul is under your leg. Do not miss this scenery.",
          "Very cheap to go up and worth it. We walked up (more strenuous than you think!) in about an hour, and got the cable car down.",
          "The views from the tower were excellent on a bright sunny autumn day.... ! The elevator ride took less tha 15 seconds to the top. There is also a Hello Kitty outlet and walkabout at the lower level...",
          "Not far from metro, a quite place in the city. good for slow walk to the cable car to the top of the mountain. Wonderful view of the city from the view. Worth visiting and the price is reasonable.",
          "This is a great place to go if you love to walk and don\u2019t mind a little steep hike. Once you get to the top the view is amazing! They\u2019ve got food and beverages at the top so don\u2019t be too worried about that.. chicken and beer and coffee of course. Inside the north tower there are",
          "Background: get all your information from the N Seoul Tower website. Gettting there: most convenient is to catch the shuttle buses described in the website. They drive a circular route, so if you catch it at the beginning of the circle just after it has descended from Namsan",
          "Like many other big cities, Seoul also has its own Tower, and the view from the top is fantastic. As in other places, such as the Tower Eiffel in France, you first travel to an intermediary platform about half of the height of the tower and then you take an elevator to the upper",
          "We went up the tower and have a look at the love locks. While looking around, I failed to see a 15 cm step down which caused me to fall down. So always look down as well while you are enjoying the view!",
          "Long queues and poor visibility due to the weather, a far better viewing platform can be found at Lotte World Tower.",
          "I took a night tour bus to here and we only had 30 minutes to take pictures at this place. I was not able to get to the top of the tower because of the time limit, however, the view I did see was fabulous. The mountain is steep and it is best to walk up it slowly if you aren't",
          "Can enjoy beautuful whole seoul city view!recommend for evening time . but verrryyyyy long waiting line for cable car ticket(almost one hour).",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning and there were pretty long queues for the cable car so took a while to get up. Queues were small to get up and down the tower though. There are great views of Seoul from the tower, but the whole experience is a bit tacky with lots of food outlets",
          "I went after dark to see the lights. The Seoul skyline is impressive. There are some food shops in the observation desk, candy, gift shop etc. There is a pretty long line coming down so be prepared to wait. We took the cable car up and back. At times they jam 40 people in the",
          "More than the tower itself, how to get to the top is the most interesting part. Based on what you prefer, you can do a 3.5 K rolling hill walk, combination of flat walk with some decent hikes - some through steps and rest through single lane path, series of steps all the way to",
          "There are so many \"LOVE\" lock place everywhere down the Tower, make u feel full of love before go up to the Tower. I like to pick candies and sit inside the tower to enjoy the view. I prefer go there before 3:00p.m. otherwise you needed to line up to get uphill by cable car.",
          "My family enjoyed going up on the tower and seeing the views and the also the interesting exhibits inside the tower. My kids particularly liked the cable car that took us up to the tower and also the shows outside the Tower. They had a sword show and a talent show.",
          "It's an amazing tower in Seoul You can see all Seoul from the top Nice places ther is restaurant and coffee shop",
          "You have a very beautiful view from the tower . It 's a magical feeling to be so high in the sky with al the clouds. The view of the city is very beautiful. It gives you the feeling to stay for a very long time up there. The more than a million love locks there, shows the",
          "Took a bus from Seoul station to tower. Must visit place in Seoul as you can have the 360 degrees whole city view. Bought ticket from klook and redeem it at kiosk outside the entrance with ease.",
          "Best is go there in the night. And I alway stay at Myeongdong area and make sure that my hostel or guesthouse can see N Seoul tower view :)",
          "I had tried to go to N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and the queue was so long it would have taken at least 2 hours to get up, plus it was rainy. Instead I went back the next day and not only was it better weather and almost no queue, but they didn\u2019t make me buy a new ticket and",
          "Namsang tower is a great experience, from the cable car drive to the walkways with thousands of \"love-locks\" and the stunning view from the top. We find the view late afternoon is the most beautiful, and no need to pay to get to the top of the tower.",
          "Its better for me, take the hop of hop off, so they in a way explained historic places, the other just take you at their time, at the end goes to a natural antiaging shop",
          "Well worth it. Awesome views! A short walk from Myeongdong, where I stayed. I took the cable car up and walked down.",
          "Was a good relaxing environment to catch sunset, they have different areas to enjoy the attraction. There were gift shops restaurants... we enjoyed the candy shop at the observation deck\ud83e\udd23",
          "Huge disappointment. Went to the cablecart to get there but it was closed due to strong winds (s**t happens) so we had to take the bus. The line for the bus was massive, took 60min of waiting. After the bus drive headed to the tower, took the elevator up, collected our tickets",
          "Nice walk up the hill. Good scenary. Visit the Ryan cheese ride, taking cute bear photos. and Hello Kitty Island also. Lots of peoples.",
          "The hiking till the tower is absolutely worth it. Once you reach the top there are several shops and resturants, typical stuff for turist. I really advice to pay the fee to go at the top floor of the Tower!! Beautiful experience.",
          "Every travel guide to Seoul recommends you to visit the N Seoul Tower, but after queuing up in the long lines to take the cable car up, you are faced with another long queue and expensive tickets to head up to the observatory. Way too crowded and too much lights from the sign to",
          "I went during the day so I could see the area clearly. The views were very good and the windows on the observation deck showed what major city was in that direction and how far the distance is from there.",
          "One can walkdown,by bus or cable way to reach to the bottom of tower.the surrounding is natural,picturesque.Observatory desk not too high and view also not clear.The speciality is one can bind a lock to the fencing and take photos.But its not a big tower than",
          "I went at night time and bought a 1 way ride to N tower, there was a kpop band doing a concert their which you got to watch for free, the views of seoul at night were amazing. If you give during the day you can enjoy the park aswell. There is loads to do at N tower. The walk",
          "Do go there if you get the chance! The drive to the top of the hill is through a beautiful park.Cars have to park at the bottom but buses are allowed to drive three quarters of the way up.There is a steep climb at the end but well worth it! You are taken into a room with a",
          "Awesome location and must visit activity. Go there prior sunset and stay there until sunsets to view sunset",
          "we follow google maps. and we missed the stop. better listen to the announcement in the bus. since we missed the stop we walked to the Namsan Library. From Namsan library we chosed to walk steep 1,6 km..not to hard in autumn since the cool temperature. it was beautiful and",
          "We're not gonna complain about the hours it took to get to the observatory because had it been a good experience we would've forgot about the hasssle; but it was not! Once we reached the observatory, we couldn't enjoy the view as the reflection of the food and drinks' station",
          "Too many lines. No sign posts. View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective. The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better. If in Seoul, one could consider going to tick off the list but this one's quite average.",
          "Was a big walk up, we chose not to take the sky lift, take plenty of water and good shoes. Its doable though and worth the good work out. Great views by the time you get to the top the tower is more like a lighthouse, so don't be worried if issues with heights. Beautiful views,",
          "The tower gives a great opportunity for fantastic views over the city. Even at base level the views are great but the 360 view from the observatory is better. However, its not the cheapest of venues to visit - so make sure its a clear day, else it's an expansive cloud view.",
          "Namsam tower is a must go not only for locals but visitors alike, especially I you're looking for a romantic scenery. Although it can get a bit crowded sometime, it is well worth the travel at least once in your life. It's not only for couples so don't feel left out if you are",
          "Lots of development around the tower over the past several years. My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods. I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions. Other options to the tower are cable car and bus. There is are",
          "Arrived at cable car station only to find it was cancelled due to winds. Advised to take a No.2 bus to tower, but could not find it. Decided to take short cut up the steps!. Ascended with sensible pace and forced stops !! Bought tickets and lift to top floor.The 360 view was",
          "We spend lots of time waiting in line to go up and even more to go down. The view from the bottom of the tower were maybe even better than from the top. Really overrated site.",
          "Even before you go up to the tower the surrounding grounds look pretty. Lots of selfie time with beautiful backgrounds. The love locks area..the love archway when lighted up. Go there during the evening time and you can have both the day and night time photos. A few eateries",
          "Recommend coming here in the evening for a great view of Seoul lit up. I didn't go on the observation deck, but managed to get good views of the city from down below. There are a few reasonably priced restaurants on the lower floors of the tower. Bus no 2 goes here from the",
          "As usual the tower Is a must if you wish to see the city from the top. Great view and location around is also interesting.",
          "One of the best viewing platforms in Seoul. Only costs around \u00a34 compared to \u00a316 at Seoul's Sky. Although the observation deck is lower the view is much more beautiful than Seoul sky and you can see all the sky scrappers which are especially nice during dusk and at night when",
          "Well, you gotta do it when in Seoul, right? Trouble is, everyone else had the same idea, so it was 'rammed' at the top. Terrific view, though, as you'd expect, although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at night-time, spoiling photos a",
          "Very good to visit but if possible avoid of the weekend as it can get quite busy. Be prepared to wait for at least 1 hour in the line each way.",
          "Too bad that we were not able to go inside the tower itself only a distance from it since it was too cold. We were just at a village tourist attraction down below. It looks nice from afar.",
          "We made the mistake of trusting Google Maps to get up to the tower. It took us to no man's land and our curvaceous Tongan bodies had to hike up the mountain certain someone would have a heart attack on the way. Though it seemed like a bad idea, once we finally got up the",
          "It is a tower located on the hillside, you need to take a cable to go to the hill top, you need to walk around the square where you will see lots of padlocks. But, you have to pay for 11,000 won to go up the observatory to see the whole country view. You can also have a meal at",
          "We were there on a Korean holiday so it was very crowded. So much so, the line was too long to up up into the tower. We went by cart as far as we could and walked around Namsan Park. Even from there buildings below looked liked a \"Legoland\". Great perspective of the highly",

          "The view of Seoul city is beautiful to see from this place. I recommend to come here by sunset. There is an area where you can leave locks of love so don't forget to bring your own locks and write a message if you'd like to leave one. There are also shops and food shops. It's",
          "Seoul Tower is iconic, it is a must do attraction while in Seoul. One thing to keep in mind is if you go on a Saturday night and do not make a reservation at their top tier, expensive restaurant you will wait a while to go to the top. When we bought our tickets it was going to",
          "Make sure and scout out the hot spot times. I went at a very busy time and the hours spent waiting to get to the look out, not the observatory tower, was excruciating. Beautiful and worth it, nonetheless. Seoul, especially is full of lovey dovey photo ops.",
          "Seoul North Tower was the final stop of our first day tour in Seoul. I can truly say that we were not ready for walk up the steep hill/incline/mountain (lol) to get to the tower. Of course. there\u2019s easier way to via Tram. But we decided to be brave, it was a real workout, but",

          "We planned an afternoon visit. If you are hard of walking like my partner or pregnant like myself this is not recommended. The queue to get tickets for the cable car is extremely long and in this Seoul late summer heat is was unbearable. The queue moves quickly however there is",

          "Lovely walk up instead of the cable car, lots of steps but shaded through the trees, some squirrels and birds to see on the way. Great views over Seoul without going up the tower. The usual coffee and restaurants in the buildings below the tower.",
          "We went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated. Admittedly, there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here, unless you've got plenty of time in Seoul. By all means, go and",

          "Lots available. Would be a great date spot where you could spend most of the day. Different food options, good little hike, can opt for a cable car ride, fun love lock location, a kids area, and just some nice nook and crannies to sit and enjoy.",
          "We walked from Myeongdong area to the cable car station (20-25 mins) where we took \ud83d\udea0 (W35000 for 3 adults 1 child) to the tower ground floor. We booked tickets at the Klook apps in advance for entering the tower which are much cheaper. It gave instant confirmation with QR",

          "I think it was worth the line and wait to go up to the to. There are lots of fun things to see and do as well. The tram up and down is such a unique experience highly recommend for anyone visiting Seoul",

          "It\u2019s one of the most famous spot in Seoul - must visit. We walked from the Namsangol Hanok Village, fresh atmosphere, nice weather. We really like it. It only can be reached by the cable and it\u2019s worth. You can see full view of Seoul city if you go to the top of the tower. So 2",

          "There are two ways to go up to N Seoul Tower, using a cable car or walking. We chose to go with a cable car. The cable car was pretty expensive,and a little long line, but we're okay with that. It was a beautiful view from the cable car. We can see the city view. When we",
          "My second visit to N Seoul Tower was tons more comfortable than my first one as I didn't have to spend hours finding my way to the tower (brief recap: we got lost, walked for almost an hour, and ended up riding a bus). This time, we rode a bus and alighted at the tower's lower",

          "We opted to walk from the nearest metro station all the way to the top and were pleasantly surprised to find that the road up is not actually that long. It is steep for sure but goes quite quickly and I am a slow walker. The tower itself was impressive and we opted to go up onto",
          "An early dinner on 38th floor of Hotel Lotte and we were off to the N Seoul tower .We could see the tower from the hotel . After a mini bus ride to a little hill , we had a cable car ride to the hill top to reach the base of the tower. A swift lift took us to the observation",
          "I have to say that I have a profound love for korea so coming to the famous N tower was a must. The view is just magnificent and there are many places to take cool pictures. If you go in cold weather seasons go well covered because if chilly up there. Also I don't think is",
          "Want some fresh air and exercise? A good way to do that is to walk up one of the many trails or paths/steps to the top. A nice walk with good scenery. At the top.... well, not so great and very touristy with inflated prices for everything. I highly recommend that you forget the",
          "This is where you can get a nice view os the whole city. I decided to go up walking and there are many nice tracks to get there if you are motivated to walk more than an hours otherwise take the cable car. Plenty of restaurants and shops. Very popular place.",
          "My mistake is to visit this popular attraction on a weekend evening. When I arrived on Sunday at 9:40pm and got the ticket, it showed the estimated waiting time to take the lift is 40 mins. Examine the crowd. Well, the city view on top is nice, with all the buildings and streets",
          "This is the best place for Seoul city night views. However, the waiting time for the cable car is quite long as it is crowded with locals and tourists. Overall, it is worth a visit if you enjoy night views. p.s. speaking personally, I think that paying to go up to the viewing",
          "Yes, there's a great view at the top - just like in the Empire State Building or other tall buildings in the world. But I actually found the (free) view from places like Namsan hill to be even more spectacular without the crowds, the cost and the hoopla. Steep walk from bus",
          "We really enjoyed our time there. We went up by hiring a private taxi from Klook along with the ticket to enter the tower. If you wanna partipate in lock with your partner. I recommend not buying from there it cost to much. You can chill out in the twosome cafe and have fun.",
          "We rode a bus going up the peak. It was a busy day in Namsan Tower.. When the bus reached the parking lot, you still have to walk about 10 minutes in a steep slope to climb to the tower itself.. The place was full of people and stuffs being sold.. We were told it was nice to go",
          "It was very nice night view of Seoul city. People was not that croweded and could see the fantastic view of the capital city.",
          "The tower offers great panorama of Seoul. I didn't go to the tower during my previous visits. This time my hotel was in a walking distance, therefore I decided to visit the tower. I went in the morning and walked, instead of using the cable car. Surprisingly, there were many",
          "Definitely worth a visit if just for the Seoul views. You go up by cable car. There is a whole collection of ' lovers locks' tied to each other and to whatever it can be locked on. Largest collection I have ever seen. The views from the top are mindblowing and give a fair idea",
          "The tower has great views of Seoul. We took the cable car up and walked back to the bus for our return to the city. Lots of options to get there, things to see, coffee and food available to enjoy while you take in the view, even the toilet as a view:)",
          "The Seoul tower is more than a great view. It's great fun for the whole family, there a park in the area, hello kitty mini park, cheeseball adventure and plenty of wal trails to catch a view before the view. To top it off you can get there by cable car that has it own wow view.",
          "They seem to think this tower can compete with worldwide tall buildings. It\u2019s laughably short, but compared to the other buildings in the city, it does provide a nice view of the city. We did a beer and popcorn package, but if you don\u2019t get it to take up (we wanted to sit and",

          "Walked over to the cable cars from the hotel. Took me a little while to find. Only 10,000 KRW ($8.66) to go to the top. Cheapest tower I've ever been up. Thursday afternoon, and although it was not empty, I certainly would not call it crowded. Views were okay. Difficult",
          "While there is a cost to go to the top, the mid-levels are fun, with nice views and lots of entertainment going on during the day.",
          "N Seoul Tower provides great views of the city (on a clear day). This is not our thing; ergo the rating. There is a lot of activity in the tower, and there are lots of people--both tourists and locals. We suspect that it might be better to visit in the evening.",

          "We kind of got a bit lost going up there because we had a misunderstanding with the bus driver. So we took the cable car instead and fortunately it was not crowded and the ride up was nice. You had to wait for a while for the elevator though, but the view was really good. You",
          "I feel like a trip up the Namsan Tower is a highlight of visiting Seoul. However, make sure you are prepared to spend a long time waiting. There is a wait if you want to take the Omni elevator to the cable car station (or you can choose to walk up the stairs like we did), there",
          "Namsan Tower AKA N Seoul Tower. Great place for a all round aerial view of Seoul. We took a walk up to the cable car station from Myeongdong Station. Takes around 15mins. Remember to bring along your locks \ud83d\udd10 or you can get one from the shops there. Locks are pretty",
          "There are many beautiful spots to see on the way leading to the tower. There are the Locks of Love which are posted in and around the various fences of this area. You can even buy your own padlock and leave a message on it and then lock it onto a post or wherever there was",
          "You can get great views from here but during peak times of the year it does get overcrowded. But definitely worth going to at least once",
          "Went up by cable car, was a very interesting experience! There are LOADS of locks couples put everywhere. They put it on stair railings, poles, anywhere they possibly can. Bring your own lock! We didn\u2019t buy a ticket up the tower. The view from below was already amazing!",
          "N Seoul Tower is one place you must to go when you are in Seoul. What Amazing view is ! Take a bus number 5 from Myeongdong Market. Bus stop locates in 3 exit of Myeongdong subway station. N Seoul Tower is last stop.",
          "Get an uninterrupted view of Seoul from the tower. The whole place and gardens below are beautiful. From the bus stop the walk up the hill is reasonably steep but it takes only 5 minutes to reach the ticket office and elevator. Wear good gripping shoes as down is as hard as up.",
          "The N Seoul Tower is such a prominent landmark that you will just have to see it, and the best time to go is before sunset. The light on the Tower is an indication of the current air quality: from blue to red. It was green (normal air quality) during our visit. We\u2019d visited",

We got to the tower from the cable car. There\u2019s restaurants and shops at the",
          "Like any other tall building/attraction, you go for the view. I found N Tower to be less of a rip off than most of these types of places. It was cool to ride the unmanned tram up a small hill to the cable car. Views were great. They do charge for the cable car as well as to go",
          "This was great to find. First get off at Myeong-dong and take exit 1. There is a free shuttle to the tram. You can Google 'free Namsan shuttle bus' and you will get the site with time schedule. I think it is hourly. Go up the tram, or if you want walk to bar of tower. Go up",

          "After going up countless towers on a tour of Japan and Korea, perhaps this was a \u2018tower too far\u2019. So I accept that this may influence this review. We had to wait 30 minutes at the cable car before we could get up. The Q down was even worse, so it\u2019s quicker and more fun to walk",
          "Stupidly I agreed to walk with my friend from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. It took an hour but don't worry, there are several buses which go to the top. Out of the 3 towers you can have a view of Seoul, this is the cheapest and buying from Klook is 40% cheaper. N Seoul Tower",
          "Best to go a little before sunset to fully enjoy the view from the o observatory. We went on a Friday late afternoon and there was queue for the cable car rides. There are many choices of food available. Do take time to enjoy a coffee and savor the sights. What was terrible",
          "We hiked up the mountain using a stairway path. It was a hard hike! But once we got to the top there were lots of things to do. I think the coolest part was seeing all the \"locks of love\" at the top. There's a lot of restaurants up there and we went to Tokyo Steak which I highly",
          "I caught the cable car because it was easier for me to get to. When you make your way out of the station at the top, you're greeted with nice views and lots of the famous love locks. The view so far is really nice and you can see quite far. I thought \"The view from the",
          "We were lucky we visited on a good weather, and we could see the views clearly. The toilet cubicle is so interesting too, with a big mirrow reflection in front of toilet seat and the glass panel at the side of it, so we could either look out to the view outside or look at",
          "If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city, this is the place to go. I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at",
          "We made the journey to the tower giving ourselves plenty time but disappointed to find the ticket booth had closed early. We were also ushered away from a viewing deck despite it being quite a bit before the displayed closing time. We did have a bit of a wander about where we",

          "The N-Seoul tower is located close to the town centre and so provides a great vantage point to see \u2018greater\u2019 Seoul and gain an appreciation of its size. We visited during the day and (apparently) were fortunate in that the air was relatively clear, which allowed us to see more",

          "Great views of the city all around. Take the Namsan cable car from the Hoehyeon-dong platform to Yejang-dong platform at the top of Mt Namsan near the N Seoul Tower. The cable car is about 605m meters up hill over the road & forest with scenic views of Seoul below. You then",
          "We took the cable car up to the tower. It was a lot bitter than I imagined. It has few restaurants and many sites for photos. We loved walking around the tower and taking in the view of the city. We ate at the restaurant at the tower and it was surprising really good. It",
          "We were here on a tuesday afternoon and it was perfect. Stunning view over the entire city. The cable cart cost about 10,000 won, and so did the entrence to the observation deck. The restaurant on the observation deck is very pricey, but there is a great Italian restaurant on",
          "I was using cable car to reach this place. And it's so amazing. You could see Seoul from this place. This place is so romantic \ud83d\ude0d.",

          "I love this place getting there was as much fun as the attraction lots to do great views and plenty of great pictures The lines can be very long depending on the time of year you visit You can walk but we took a cab and then used the cable tram to get to the top. The lines for",
          "A bit of a uphill walk from myeongdong' but so worth it once you make it to the top. There is a tram that will bring you to the base of the tower, then take the elevator to the viewing deck of the tower, for a charge for both.",
          "We visited the N Seoul Tower in April 2019, and were not disappointed. The surrounding was beautiful with cherry blossoms all around it. The view was spectacular, especially at the top of the tower. We bought the tickets the day before on Trazy.com, and got a 25% discount. It",
          "We were advised on which bus to take. The view at the foot of the tower was beautiful. Bought ticket up to Observatory floor on 5th floor which included lunch at Hancock restaurant, cost 50,000 won altogether. The view was nothing special.",
          "Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul. It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it\u2019s manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful",
          "While the tower itself is like most viewing towers, the whole experience is unique. You start from the walk up to the cable car centre. Then there is the joy of taking the cable car up to the base of the tower. Once you arrive on the other side, there are lots of picture spots",

          "We walked up to base of the tower and back. Pleasant climb in a natural setting. The top on the hill has some shops and food and some public seats so you can spend some time.",
          "There are very few elevators. Once ypu get off the cable car it is nothimg but stairs. The veiw is beautiful but not worth the hike. Getting on and off the cable car there was nothing but stairs. Not sings letting us know. There is an elevator from the main road to the cable car",
          "My first trip there. Good eye opener to see how this being built and its concept. The weather was not good during our visit. Could really see the outside view. But with visiting. The ticket price cheaper will be good.",
          "Other than the steep steep walk towards the tower where the padlocks are, there wasn't really much to see here. The food at the top were limited and pricey. Our trip here could have been replaced by another place but what the heck; a check mark for you now that we've seen it.",
          "I went here wanting to go up to the top but it was a very hazy/polluted day so I don\u2019t go to the top as you can walk around and see Seoul for free. Great views on a clear day!",
          "Visited with a good colleague and he talked me into visiting on a day with good views. It was fantastic; what an experience. On the square at the foot of the tower there are lots of activities.",
          "Awesome site to see while in Korea. It\u2019s a must see. We went to the top and took pictures. There\u2019s even the little lock thing that people do. You can\u2019t miss it they\u2019re everywhere. They sell them there so no worries about bringing your own. I was told they\u2019re love locks.",
          "I came here because I saw how popular it was in the Korean drama. I was a little disappointed because I thought that the outside was the elevator that can go around to the top. Well, when you get inside, it's just an elevator that takes you to the top straight up, not go around",
          "Was happy that our guide was able to drive us almost to the top where the views were good but because of the haze rather restricted distant views",
          "I've been to many tower view points in my tours (Seattle Needle, Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building to name a few) and here it was a bit disappointing. We're reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city, but as the visibility was very poor due to",

          "My hotel was not far away, so I walked to the cable car station, which was easy to find. I decided not to walk up the path because I have a bad knee and climbing that many stairs would have hurt. I bought a one way ticket for 7,000 won. I didn\u2019t have to wait long for my turn on",

          "Maybe it\u2019s Labor Day holiday so there were many people/tourists. From the bottom of slope waiting for elevator up to the ticket station , queuing to collect tickets, to go up the tower station and finally to top of tower was long long queue and we waited for almost 2-3 hrs. I",
          "There is quite a bit to do at this location including many restaurants to have a meal. However, this attraction is at its best only when the weather is clear and the air is clear, so you can see afar. If the weather isn't so good, than it would be a slight disappointing",
          "I am thrilled to find cherry blossoms in here! Good place for sightseeing and picturetaking although most of the time there were too many tourist in here.",
          "Really beautiful, we went during the day however I think at night would be spectacular. Also don\u2019t go on a day where there is dust, as the view isn\u2019t good on a day where there is a lot of pollution.",
          "Must visit in Seoul. Colder up there, wear warmer clothes and gear specially if you\u2019re visiting from October to April.",
          "Use the cable car going up, you can easily walk down on your way back. This site will show you how big and wide and how progressive Seoul is. It\u2019s really impressive, and the site itself is a mix representation of Korea, very advance but they have cultural presentations scattered",
          "Tried to go 5pm on Sunday. It was super crowded. At the cable Car, they put up a sign saying queue will take 90 min. We skipped that and went to the tower. A long queue again to go to the observatory. But I strongly suggest exploring outside first where the love Locks are",
          "Really nice place with beautiful night scenery. Took a cable car up and the night view was awesome. Be sure to lock down your love with a padlock there!",
          "For first-time visitors, and if sightseeing is an important agenda in your visit then you should definitely visit this place. For starters, it gives you a breathtaking view of Seoul and depending on visibility, you can see nearby mountain ranges. I assume that it also gives a",
          "Really great views, people watching, coffee and <some> food options up top. We walked/hiked up (paved) through what's l like a linear garden with fresh air and nice views. Then pay to go up to the top, the views of the enormous Seoul metropolitan area are outstanding! Top it off",
          "Only stay up there for a short while. Nothing fanciful. Head straight to the ticket booth to purchase your ticket as you will be given a number and you got to wait for your number to be called.",
          "A must go place for tourist, however if i go again. I wouldnt go up the tower. Ill just buy the cable car ticket And i reckon the view there is good enough",
          "There are two ways to go, by walk and by cable car. We had used walk. Many stairs in a beautiful forest full of spring flowers and birds. Tired but happy. On top was waiting for us N Seoul Tower. View from the top is amazing. Special, when is good weather and visability. You can",
          "Once we got off the bus, we were surprised by the steep walk up the tower. It was difficult especially with a stroller. Then, when we got to the foot of the tower, there was a long line in the elevator and we decided to take the stairs so were very tired when we arrived to the",
          "I would recommend visiting this place during day time for better photo taking. The hotel I stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel is very near to the tower and we got on a direct bus just in front of the hotel. Easy and convenient. The love lock area is always packed with tourists and",
          "Excited. While we were in line for the cable car, I thought it will only take us a few mins to hop in. Not really. If you want to take the cable car, it will be a very convenient journey to the top~But you'll have to wait more than 30 mins looping around before you can even",
          "Try to go from evening to night. U get a nicer view of the city. There is long queue but move quite fast",
          "Unsure if it was the time we went but the lines were HUGE! We caught the elevator up to the cable car, the cable car up to the tower and then the elevator to the observation deck. There are quite a number of stairs and my poor Dad who has bad knees from an old sporting injury",
          "The Hop On & Off Bus makes a stop here. Gorgeous view from the top. It was a great day weather wise. The tulips were in full bloom as well as the cherry blossoms. Don\u2019t forget to use the restroom inside at the top to take in another great view.",
          "They provide a shuttle bus from the subway station. This bus stop in some points and also reach the tower park area. Cost 10.000 Won for observatory deck but I bought online in Klook.com because it's cheaper (half price). Locals bring food and do some picnics in this area. I",
          "What I liked the most about the visit was hiking our way up to the top. It\u2019s a nice walk that rewards you with nice views and a few restaurants. The views from the top are ok although the smog is not helpful.",
          "Limited interest as very touristic place with many fast food restaurants and gift shops. The panoramic view is nice by clear weather and you can really see the dimension of the city. To do if you have time to waste but not a must do.",
          "This the best view point location from which all can gaze down on the whole city of Seoul. But our best memories will be of the restrooms. Restrooms were floor to ceiling glass and we got in trouble when there were women in the men's bathroom. The men face out and the women",
          "I got here by subway than catch a shuttle bus no3 to come up here. Be there around 3.30 pm I saw some traditional performance. Then walk around the place. I brought the e-ticket from trip.com got some discount. The top of the observer floor you can see the Seoul city in 360",

          "This tower used to be among the tallest in Asia. Going to the tower itself would be a steep uphill climb . You will be rewarded with awesome views of the city before you enter this attraction. The elevator going to the observatory point is a breeze, and is quite fast. But with",
          "This place is very nice specially for lovers. It has a view overseeing the city which is very beautiful. Nice place for picture taking. Senior citizens will find it a little bit challenging to climb. Must see when visiting korea.",

          "We rode the gondola to the top of the hill and enjoyed the views from Seoul Tower. The souvenir shop and the teddy bear shop were favorites. We hiked down and enjoyed the vistas along the way.",
          "The only nice thing is rows of cherry blossom trees going up the to the place on the bus shuttle There are small shops selling ice cream and beverages at the outside of the tower",
          "We took the cable car to Namsan park. It was a uphill climb to the cable car station. The view at the lower deck is sufficient for us. We did not go to the observation deck. Be there early to avoid the crowds as there were bus loads of tourist when we left the place at around 11",
          "Well, we do not choose to go up by skycab. we walk up from Namsan park. it was a right decision we made! Namsan park is abeautiful park and nice place to see sunset. we visited during the evening. and when reach the N tower, the night view of Namsan City really make us feel",
          "Nice view. This is up at the top of a mountain. The area has the Lovelocks corner where you see a lot of padlocks put by couples and you can even put one too. There's a store there selling love locks. There's also the beacons, and the tower itself which you can go up using an",
          "Seoul Tower is an excellent viewing point. You will have a nice view of Seoul from the base of the tower even if you do not choose to take the elevator to the top. It is quite crowded on the weekends. On the weekends they usually have a small flea market there in late",

          "The North Seoul tower is the best way to see the city and the amazing views around Seoul. Take the gondola/ cable car up which is near Myeong-dong Metro station and you are taken to tower base within 10 minutes. The views at the base of the tower are stunning but you get the",
          "The view is great but the 90 minutes que to lower elevator and 60 minutes que at the top is not worth it. Go there and enjoy the view from the lower deck for free.",
          "A cheap morning or afternoon activity that\u2019s allows you to appreciate the scale and density of the city that is Seoul. They run a tight ship here: you are up top in no time. I recommend booing via Klook and simply scanning your pass at a machine to print a ticket; saves a",
          "I took the challenge to hike up for about 3 kms to and from N Seoul Tower. Once you reach the top, the magnificent view of the city from afar is worth the climb.",

          "The walk towards the tower may seem exhausting at first but once you get to the place and see the view of Seoul, you regain all that drained energy \ud83d\ude02 The view is definitely breathtaking \u2764 The only thing I disliked about it was that we were on a tour group so we had little",
          "We visited the Namsan Tower as part of a voucher deal we purchased. The walk up the mountain looked like a lovely and peaceful hike but not an easy climb therefore we took the easy route up via cable car. Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds however the view can still",
          "Seeing the whole Korea was fun. Travelling through cable car is more fun too. Lots of restaurant to choose from is a plus.",
          "It was an overwhelming experience to see the downtown Seoul especially in the middle of the night when the city lights are colourful, we also managed to send a postcard to the post box right at the observation deck. Thanks to Klook we managed to get a discount price and save a",
          "I usually shy from expensive tower attractions that involve several intervals lining up in queues. Mid morning and midday really was not bad for the lines. We had no more than 10 minute waits. You absolutely MUST go to the bathroom as both genders have private bathroom views!",

          "Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for",
          "This was a nice stop. At your leisure you can walk from the bus stop up to the Seoul Tower. My son and I were looking forward to the Cable Car but when we go to the top, we found out it was closed. We were so disappointed.... Anyways ...we just walked around the viewing area",
          "Fresh air and awesome view! Staying up there in the morning with sunset is just beautiful. It\u2019s a bit cold for this time but worth it! You will have an overall view over Seoul",
          "N Seoul tower and the surrounding Namsan park and gardens provide a nice break from the busy city. Enjoy a walk through the gardens up to the tower or take the cable car.",
          "Nothing spectacular about the tower itself however on a clear day you can see all of Seoul and the surrounding areas and mountains. It is a must to visit the toilets which have a clear glass wall and a wonderful View.",
          "We took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less. One would hardly feel it because there's a video showing on the ceiling while it's going up. The best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies' comfort room. One",

          "We didn\u2019t pay for the tickets to go up since the view from the bottom was already nice. I took the cable car up to Seoul tower. There were so people walk up which was free and they can also saw the view while they were walking. We took the cable car down and there was a lift",
          "The second highest point in Seoul city, this tower provides a gorgeous view of the city at night. The observation deck at the top provides a dazzling cityscape from the glass windows and houses a souvenir shop. While exiting the tower, I also came across the row of Love Padlock",
          "We went at night time and it was a lovely clear evening so the view was good. You catch the cable car up. If you are a senior 65 or over you get a discount. The locks of love are there and there must be millions of them. It should take you no more than an hour ago do this",
          "We are from the United States, so we're not able to really plan this visit around the weather. If you go, be sure to go on a clear day. We were lucky to have great visibility the day we went. The \"locks of love\" was great as well. We had no idea about it before going, and. were",
          "I've been here twice, once in the evening and once in the day. From the entrance to the tower, you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and it's a great view. It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for",
          "I'm sure the views would be nice if it weren't for the smog. 360 views of the city available. Avoid the souvenir shop. Utter rip off. Was charged 9,500 won x 4 for four cards to send to folks back home. That's almost $40 USD!! I'm honestly horrified that they charge such",
          "The tower experience itself is quite good. IMHO however, the Seoul skyline isn't particularly striking (e.g. compared to Busan). There are enough interesting things to eat and explore around the tower as well to spend a couple of hours. Tip: be sure to check out the restroom on",
          "Although the queue is quite long but on the top of the tower the 360 degree view is just fantastic! Beautiful place for sunset.",
          "Very happy we made it to this attraction. We got here during sunset and it was great. Very busy though so beware of people",
          "We went on a nice sunny clear day and were able to see all around the city. I recommend getting the beer and popcorn adult package (you can take it up with you).",
          "You can get a good view of Seoul at both the bottom and the top. That is because the tower is located on a mountain that is at one of the highest points in Seoul. Walking up the mountain is a nice way to get there, but there are also buses from Seoul Station to get to the top of",
          "Went to N Seoul Tower for the 3rd time already..never fails to amaze me. My faves there are visiting the Hello Kitty Island & the Locks of Love. So easy to go there from Myeongdong, just ride Bus 05. Always enjoyed my experience in N Seoul Tower! Till next time!",
          "Got up at 5:30an to hike from Meyongdong to the top. Amazing views along the way. Very physically draining. You will need to be pretty fit to make. Well worth it when you get to the top. Took me an hour up and 30 mins down. Which included breaks to take photos. Cable car wasn\u2019t",
          "This could be a very romantic place to visit. Views are great although it was extremely hazy on the day we visited. Not sure how it looks at night but I bet its very nice. You can hike up or take the cable car. It\u2019s definitely a worthwhile visit while in Seoul",
          "My family of 4 stayed near Seoul Tower and made the mistake of choosing to walk to the tower. From the map, we are just less than 800m away to the tower. But the walk to the tower took us nearly an hour. The 1st part was just a uphill walk, quite tiring but managable. The 2nd",

          "Having visited quite a number of these towers, this is by far the best! The tower itself is not as tallest but the atmosphere within and around is unbeatable. The endless number of padlocks and viewpoints make this a special place. Once up the tower you get great views of the",

          "One of the place that I looked forward so much, but, ended up being so disappointed. It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation. Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well, but, the hike up to the N tower was worth it, the view of Seoul from above is just",

          "Tourist attractions. For transportation to here and out, i suggest using a bus. More cheap and convenient. But for a life experience, can using cable car",
          "Refreshing view. You don\u2019t need to get on top of the tower to get an overall view of Seoul city. The walk to the tower is very refreshing too.",
          "Going Namsan Tower in winter morning is the right decision. The air is cold but so fresh. View as always pretty amazing. If lucky you can have snow fall here.",
          "The view is worth getting to the tower. No need to go all the way though. It's a long wait for a minimal experience. Stay on the outside and walk around...breathtaking",
          "Except for the fairly long queues (we visited at around 7PM) the experience you get is unique and worth all the 11000KW (around 10$ at today\u2019s rate). We visited the tower in the Halloween time and everything was very nicely decorated. The \u2026",
          "Make sure to come during a clear and cloudy day. Check the air pollution as well.\n\nTransportation to Seoul tower is quick and easy. You can choose to walk all the way up or take a bus that drops you off close to the tower. Afterwards there \u2026",
          "Been there 2 times, very well located you can have a view all over the city it's very nice.\nGoing there by walk is totally worth it and take around 20minuts, it's better to walk than to take the cable car in my opinion.",
          "This is place is so nice! Going inside the actual tower costs a little more, but is very much worth it! They have some cool merch (obv. Over priced) that you can only really find up there! The view is also breathtaking!",
          "Literally one of the top must sees in Seoul no matter what other sights u gonna go for. Albeit with the crowds of people lining up to get to the top of the city, the overall experience is still great. \nIt\u2019s a bit expensive to have the entry \u2026",
          "Amazing 360 degree view of Seoul and nice trail up the mountain. I really enjoyed it!",
          "I hiked up to it from the north side. Great little hike. The views would have been better if not for the smog. Wasn't a fan of the amusement-park-like restaurants.....",
          "Not much in the observatory, but i enjoyed the room full of lights before going up. Love locks are nice too. Dont take the cable car, waste of money.",
          "There are city views..... It's what you expect pretty much. If you have time to go that's great but don't worry too much if you miss it.",
          "This is such a good place to have a long and peaceful walk alone or having good conversations with someone else. The view is beautiful.",
          "As with many places in Seoul its all about being romantic. Beautiful and romantic scenery and at the top theres a few small restaurants, ice-cream parlours and souvenir shops.",
          "Lot of fun with a great view!! We took the cable car to the tower then walked back down the trail lots of fun next time we will just walk straight up the trail and skip the cable car. Did not go to the top of the tower because the view is already amazing from the top of the mountain and was not worth the 11,000 won per person fee.",
          "You go up to the tower for city watch. Enjoyable if you really fond of city lights. But beyond that, really nothing more to expect",
          "Amazing place. Very cool",
          "Scenery is very beautiful from the top of the tower. However, the entrance ticket is quite expensive, as well as the prices of shops inside. If you are on a budgeting trip, i would suggest not buying the ticket, instead climb up the hill \u2026",
          "It was pretty at night to see. Not as exciting as I thought it would be but a good experience. They have love locs for sale for 10,000 WON and a marker for another 1,000. A big of a rip off so remember to bring your lock with you. Didn\u2019t \u2026",
          "One of the highlights of my trip.  Best to go around sunset.  It may be crowed but it is definitely worth it.  If crowds are not you thing, then go anytime and get a great scenic view of the city.  The tower is on top of a small mountain, so you can basically see everything.  There are buses and a cable car that bring you up there.",
          "Nice view, good for rilex, and enjoy Nature",
          "Great place to visit! Beautiful view of the city. Have been here twice during my stay, the view at night is much better than during the day, because of the smog. (You even have a great view while using the toilet!) I recommend going up by \u2026",
          "Great Experience... Once you've arrive at the Cable Car Station, you may need to buy tickets to go up to the N Seoul Tower, either one way or return. Once you've at the top of the tower, you could explore many locations to view the city. \u2026",
          "Here is good point for viewing Seoul at night time, even daytime. If you buy a cup of coffee, there will be a good cafe.",
          "It is a 260 meter tower built on a hill. You can go up the hill on an elevator or you can take stairs of you wish to burn some calories. Then you need to buy tickets for cable car. View on hill top is just superb. You can also buy tickets \u2026",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Even though all towers are the same I do like seeing the city from this vantage point. There were many things to explore, the hiking trails were actually our favourite.",
          "Cable car's pack. ... take a direct bus up then walk down the hill would be a better option.  There's cafe and restaurant at the top... so you can get some snacks and nice coffee at the top of the hill.",
          "The view worth seeing. Also, if you buy ticket to that tower, you will see small performances before the elevator",
          "Fun area with great views of Seoul (if you can see through the pollution). Restaurants and a arcade on the 4th floor. Great place to send an afternoon.",
          "Easy to go by underground train. Has cable car to the top with ticket less than 10k won. Nice view upstair. Got shop sell foods & souvenior",
          "Here is really famous in korea. If you watch Korea drama, you must know here. Lots of ppls in here and very relax. If you don\u2019t wanna climb the mountain by yourself, you can take the cable car",
          "This place was so cool! It has a really great view of Seoul and has these cool outlines of the growth of Korea overtime. The gift shop is very cute and you have to experience the elevator for yourself.",
          "Nice scenery. Photoshot spot every where. There is also the famous gate love.",
          "First of all cable car, is a transportation  to commute people from A (foothill) to B (summit). Not from halfway A to B.\n\nPoor customer care and management. The que  was too long and staff should take initiative to control or inform people.",
          "One of positive experience in Korea. Walking, seeing beautiful landscapes and flowers. There are several nice stop by spots in the park. We actually enjoyed spending whole day in there.\nfirst part of day - walking in the park.\nsecond part \u2026",
          "Great hike up to Seoul Tower. And absolutely beautiful views!!",
          "Namsan Tower in Seoul is a magical place.\n\nIt boasts of a quirky and mind bending \u201cAlive Museum\u201d, that was a source of immense fascination to me, with its 3D effect wall paintings.\n\nThe lift itself combines an entertaining ceiling video \u2026",
          "Loved the tower. Unexpected surprise before going up in the elevator. Supercool",
          "You can see large area of city. It is 3 - 5 degree colder than in the city. Many places for taking pictures and selfie",
          "This place offers a surprisingly decent view of surrounding Seoul area! It may be crowded at night, my party had to wait a time to get up and down the cable car. Perfect place for couples and lovers as it's somewhat famous for the love lockets scattered everywhere at base of tower!",
          "I guess this place is a must visit if you are in Seoul. You can either take bus, cable car or hike to go up. Pretty nice city view and cold ( we were there in December). You also can find the famous love locks with different sizes, shapes, \u2026",
          "Far the best view after Eiffel Tower, Empire State and Space Needle.\nSuch an amazing 360 skydeck.\nWorth to visit.",
          "Namsan is a very interesting destination of Korea. Many people come here every day. A special feature here is the love lock - where couples hang and show love. The higher you climb, the more beautiful the view is. The atmosphere is \u2026",
          "Great views of the city. We went both at night and during the day. They now have a new room with protector art on the walls and floor. So cool. The locks of love was a cool experience too. Take the 402 bus to the library by the Seoul tower \u2026",
          "A great and Must go place if visiting Seoul. To ho up there there is a lift, I used it last year but don't remember the price of the ticket. But this year I went by foot and it was amazing. It takes about 30 minutes to climb around 1200 \u2026",
          "Excellent place to be. The complete birds eye view of the town. Must visit",
          "Another landmark to visit while you\u2019re adventurously roaming around the city. Located upon the hill .. you\u2019re able to reach the tower by bus or walk. Due to its extreme popularity by international tourists and even local ones, some crowds \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit in the evening... Especially the sunset view was beautiful to enjoy",
          "Would recommend taking a one way trip up with the cable car. The view is amazing as you can see the mountains and the city. You can walk back down which is easier than going up. Many places to bring your love lock with your loved one.",
          "It\u2019s quite the walk to get there, but view is awesome.",
          "Just like other tower, you can reach the tower and see surrounding views from high to the ground. They make a picture of you, you can choose which one you like and pay it. There's also souvenir shop. Not so interesting",
          "Beautiful landscape. You can have a big panorama picture.",
          "I took the shuttle bus to the last stop and then walked up. Personally, i figured i would have to walk a great distance at some point, especially after visiting Busan Tower. You don't actually have to pay, unless you want an even higher \u2026",
          "Quite a long queue, so expect to see queues after queues after queues. When you finally reach the tower, you need to buy your ticket and wait for your queue number, so if you are a very impatient person, then don't go, but if you really \u2026",
          "Best views of Seoul. The cable car view also exciting.",
          "Took the cable car up here, I would recommend you taking the stairs down to enjoy the scenery if you're keen, view from up there during Autumn is amazing, probably a bit chilly for some as the wind tends to be stronger up there, overall \u2026",
          "Great view of the city from above with a some food places and a coffee shop. Not a bad way to spend the afternoon. Especially with the free traditional demonstrations that take place.",
          "Icon of Seoul, you can see wonderful city view on the top.",
          "Namsan Tower is always a great time for family, friends, dates, or even tourists. But I think it is only great if you go up the short hike (1.5km) from the Grand Hyatt. It\u2019s a nice, scenic hike that isn\u2019t the main way up, but surely the \u2026",
          "Definitely don't climb up the trail. Take the cable car it's well worth your money unless you like a physical challenge. Climbing down should be easier though. I did not go up the tower itself as i thought the ticket was pretty expensive. \u2026",
          "Overlooking Seoul.  Easy to get to.  Great view.",
          "We\u2019re lucky enough as it started to snow when we are on the way up to the tower!!! Its very picturesque with all the white ground.  \nDo make an effort to go up to the observation point at T1 for a photo session!! Some cafe and shops available on that floor!",
          "It's a beautiful place to walk, definite must if you're a couple too",
          "This place is worth it. The view outside the tower is    breathtaking, although somewhat crowded. To get to the plateau, you must either drive, walk up, or take a bus. I recommend going up the tower for sunset for gorgeous pictures, sadly \u2026",
          "I walked to the tower from Namsan market.. it only took about 39 minutes but I took it really slow. It is worth the visit especially during or after sunset. And most importantly.... visit the bathroom on the observatory floor... You will sit on a toilet for a very long time enjoying the view all to yourself. :)",
          "We took the yellow public bus to reach here. Journey was a bit rough. Luckily my parents manage to get seats on the bus as the journey uphill is a bit rough.. Nice giew on top, instagrammable spots definitely! Worth a visit even without entering the tower.. Spend about 1 and half hours here to relax on the evening before sunset..",
          "Such a good place to visit! A lot of places to eat. Lot of good experiences. Fun for kids and adults. You should have at least a few hours here. The view is amazing! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4c",
          "An essential place in the modern history of Seoul that must be on your itinerary.",
          "Mt. Namsan area is the friendly place I visit most as it was a place where I would played in my primary school days.\nEspecially Seoul Tower is located at the top of Mt. Namsan. The most characteristic is that Seoul Tower brightly \u2026",
          "Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower, is a observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul, South Korea. At 236 metres, it marks the second highest point in Seoul .You can see  bundles of padlock.Shiny and colorful padlock here written name of love one's.",
          "Wow this city is big! You only get a sense of scale from the top. Amazing.",
          "As a tourist, you can come here for a visit especially night view is good.",
          "Enjoy the hospitality here. I cannot talk any Korean but they can understand my simple English \ud83d\ude02",
          "Nice place  masha allah",
          "One of the better views of Seoul, especially at night, can be found here.\n\nOne can walk up to the tower if they don't want to pay for the cable car, but it's not for those out of shape.\n\nRestaurants can be found in the tower itself and in the square that surround it at the base.",
          "You can ride a cable car for under 10,000 won, or walk your way up the hills. I took the cable car because my feet were sore from walking hours around Seoul, but otherwise I would recommend walking up. You also have to pay to enter the \u2026",
          "Great attraction to visit. I enjoyed going up the cable car and catching the amazing views. It is best to go before 6pm because it takes up to 1.5 hours to get up to the viewing platforms and another hour to exit. Restaurants close at \u2026",
          "Most memorable part of being in Seoul. The hike up was tiring however exhilarating (I was so afraid of heights) and the view was absolutely breathtaking. Sadly, the phone I took the pictures of the view broke, as goes for all my other \u2026",
          "What's good about this place is the stressed free and awesome view. The staff inside managed to control the people who visited the place. We need to experience a bunch of stop over like photoshoot,  3D images, and a lot more before you will \u2026",
          "Nice place, good view, long walking down by foot to the main street.",
          "Cool Tower very long wait for lift up and down. 40 minutes each way. Spent about 3hrs here. Went on a Saturday afternoon. If I could do it all over again I would go at a different time. Wasted my whole afternoon I felt waiting and trying to \u2026",
          "Love this place. Second time visiting here and it amazes me. Located in a high hill in the center of city, allows good pictures and knowing people all over the world",
          "Been here 3 times. Great place for hiking",
          "We used the cable car to get up to the tower, the sunset was breathtaking and the view was gorgeous  definitely  recommend  coming up. We put our love lock there as well!",
          "Very popular observatory tower in Seoul. Features tower observatory deck, light projection holding and waiting area, interactive lift, love lock area, coffee and souvenir shops. You have to check the weather on your visit so the view from \u2026",
          "Love this place! The night view is awesome. Although it take quite some time to line up for the cable car.",
          "Loved our visit here. The views are incredible. Everything down to our wait in line was entertaining (the line is in a green screen room!)",
          "Great experience to change your perspective of Korea by seeing it as heaven sees it. Amazing!",
          "Get the popcorn beer combo. Best deal and you get to enjoy it at the top of the tower while taking in the views.",
          "Very chill and relaxing. :) you can see the Seoul city from here.",
          "Crowded, fun and worth checking out!  I went before sunset on a Saturday.  Super busy, long lines and waiting.  The cable car is large and holds many people. Waited in a long line in the lobby then walked up several flights of stairs with \u2026",
          "Much better than it was 7 years ago when I apparently visited it. Great view of downtown Seoul. And I can see my house from there.",
          "Do you like queueing? Go here. Queue to buy tickets (15) , queue to get into the cable car (45) - hilariously there's only one? car... queue to sit down to queue to pay for food. Queue to buy tickets to the observation deck and queue to be \u2026",
          "It was really nice and very touristic. It's definitely somewhere you must go to especially for couples who want love locks. I guess the only downside of it is that the gift shops are kinda pricey, so best go to Myeongdong night market instead.",
          "Loved it. Great view of Korea when riding the cable car. Very high tower. Restroom glass view of the city! Lock love features",
          "Good Seoul View   You may find it out\nFall Season of Seoul Tower",
          "Prepare to wear something comfortable in case you have to climb up or down the tower due to the long lines for the cable cars. Beautiful sights. Nice place for tourists! I ate it up. The experience was amazing!",
          "Great views of the city.  Novel, something to do.  Lines but they move fairly quickly.  A few places to eat and grab a beer.  Pictures galore.",
          "Not a good option if you want to do photography  Took maybe an hour wait to actually get up to the observation deck and when we got up there, the glass was all smudged with fingerprints on both decks. Even if it wasn't, there was a lot of \u2026",
          "Take the cable car and go to the top of the tower. It's worth it. It's more than just a tower with a view... Although the views were superb. The light room with amazing. Gift shop was high quality and there's a restaurant too.",
          "It is really cold above N tower. Do you know the feeling when you are above the mountain in summer? Its the same for winter. It will be a lot colder. \ud83d\ude01",
          "This is a nice tower to visit with its own unique perks. I did prefer my experience at Seoul Sky Tower though and would recommend that to this if you had to pick one.",
          "Good view, especially at night. The Tower is located on the hill and first you must hike to the top or just take the cable car. Although, I recommend to take a walk and admire the Seoul's panorama.",
          "Whether you take the cable car or decide to hike up, the views are incredible. You don't even need to go up the tower, but it is a reasonable charge to do so (\u20a911000).",
          "High point in Seoul with breathtaking views of the whole city. Unique - they point distance of other countries at the observation deck. Stunning views of the bridge and experience was made much more special with photo booth and friendly service.",
          "Such a nice place. Nice view. Had many facilities there.",
          "Nice place. From Myeongdong just take bus no 5 and get off at the last stop. Enjoy the view",
          "Nice view of the city. Though the bright lights from the candy store in one section of the tower adds glare to the glass, so you see shadows when looking out to the city. Book tickets online as they are cheaper. Holographic room before \u2026",
          "I love this place as it's really natural. It can only be reached by the cable car. In May 2019, it costs 8500 won for a return ticket. You don't need to pay additional fee but for the cable car only. You might need to consider bringing a \u2026",
          "If you are planning to visit South Korea, you must include this place. if you are looking for love. Love locks is the key :) :) :)",
          "Beautiful views of the city, many places to have a snack or a drink",
          "Easy to get here by public bus. Directly to the location. Great view from the tower. Observation deck ticket is 11,000 won.",
          "You can see the entire city. Unfortunately I went on a cloudy day but it was decent, though I was advised by the clerk before purchasing the ticket that the view would not be great. There are also items to see outside the tower in the quad.",
          "There are many locks on the viewing spots. People put then there to wish for good luck in love or romance. It kinda ruins the view in my opinion. Also, it can get quite crowded. Nice view overall and especially nicer when you go during good \u2026",
          "Interesting place. Worth visiting especially the Souvenir Shop. Monday morning till 12noon the lift from Myeongdong to the cable car station is closed for servicing.",
          "Interesting place to visit when you're in Seoul, great views of the city.",
          "Great views of Seoul..  best visit at night time.",
          "Nice place and here also having show performance about korea culture and you can wear free hanbook",
          "Come prepared for big queues, both coming in... And out. Everything is likely to have a very long waiting time, but that shouldn't keep you out.\n\nOn the top you'll find places to eat, all around the breathtaking view from the top of Seoul. \u2026",
          "Long waits up and down using the cable. Long wait to go up AND down the tower.  Don't come on a weekend night as it is very busy! This has been the longest attraction we have waited for on our entire trip to Korea! Views are breath-taking, \u2026",
          "Wow its unforgettable thing..we gone top of tower and see the down side its look like a fly on the roof in plane\ud83e\udd2fwonder fully enjoyed ..",
          "The tower itself is an excellent location to view the city. Though lots of people and line queues. But the surrounding area like the long stair path going down from the mountain is also an excellent route to take specially at night time.",
          "Nice attraction. can see Seoul city from up here. There is cultural and martial art show at 3pm. Don't miss it.",
          "A great place you should not miss if you travel to Seoul South Korea. There are different ways you can go to this place. \n\n1. Bus (Namsan 02, 05) - better use Naver Map. For me, this is the most convenient if you want to avoid the long line \u2026",
          "Great views. I imagine it would be beautiful at night as well. There's a restaurant up top and a Twosome Place coffee shop. The gift shop sells postcards and stamps. You can write, decorate, stamp and mail them right from the top of the tower. Steep walk from the busses to the tower",
          "The scene here is nice, you may consider to buy the online voucher from kkday with a discounted price.\n\nAs the cable car to reach the tower itself charged 10,000 won already; and if you wanted to go upto the observation deck, it will charge separately",
          "The atmosphere of this place was so cool. Unfortunately, I approved to the tower at the raining + foggy day, and could not see the city from the top but fog. Luckily, I still had some photos at the couple or love bridge. It locates at the bottom of Namsan tower. (Nam is South and San is Mountain).",
          "You will have to work a little bit of trekking to get in to the top of the Namsan mountain where the N seoul Twer located. But if you don't want to walk you also can take a cable car to get there. An the top of the tower is the observatory \u2026",
          "My very first stop in Seoul, such a fun place!  Got rather lost walking/hiking up through Namsan Park, perhaps would recommend cable car both ways! I felt it was good value but actually there are many cute shops and things to see outside as well esp appreciating all the many many love locks! Bring your own or buy one there",
          "A must see if you\u2019re visiting Korea. 9.500 won to take the cabin car up to the tower and another 9.500 for going up to the tower. There\u2019s combos for popcorn and drinks that are reasonable. \n\nThere's quite a bit of walking but there's \u2026",
          "Worth the trip up. Beautifully tended gardens and park leading up to a small, modern, and understated market area with several restaurants and souvenir shops. $10 to go to top of tower, but free to still see great views if you want to stay at the lower levels.  Local tour buses stop at the tower or can be accessed by cable car.",
          "It was a great place to see the whole city! Make sure you make reservations if you want to eat in the fancy restaurants or there are lots of casual options. Lots of things to see and do.",
          "Lovely lookingout tower! You can see the northern Seoul from the centre. One can see the entirety of the old city, Hanseong. There are maps that show you where certain locations are.\n\u2606The ticket is considerably cheaper than other observation decks worldwide.",
          "Beautiful view! To go up you can take bus #02 all the way to the top, and then walk a little bit to the tower. The tickets  are purchase inside the tower. There's a few restaurants you can eat at, with a nice view. You can also buy post cards and stamps, and dropped them off right there too.",
          "Nice view frm the top, can see part of Seoul.",
          "Great views of the city. Not as tall as the Lotte Seoul Tower, but set up on a hill which gives it almost as much of a commanding view. Several coffee shops and restaurants as well as gift shops at the tower as well. Spend an hour for a \u2026",
          "The most fantastic view in Seoul. If you have 2 hour of free, you'd better visit here absolutely. The fresh air will make you happy.",
          "I went to the tower by night and it was well worth it. It is not cheap to go up but the view is amazing. Watch out for tourist masses, especially during the day. There will be lines for the elevator.",
          "Amazing views at night! Although it is pricey to get on top. \nArround 8USD to use the cable car (Totally worth it). And around 20 USD to get on top of Namsan Seoul Tower.",
          "Beautiful 360 view of the city, a must visit for any trip to seoul. Try to go on a clear night - then you can make out the Lotte World Tower. The lights of Seoul cannot be missed.",
          "Great views! The walk up at sunset us incredible",
          "Awesome view, just remember to catch the bus up AND down because it is a much longer walk than you might think",
          "Make sure you walk up. It's worth the hard climb.",
          "Must visit if you are going to seoul, it is located to to near Myeong dong subway station. Rather than taking Taxi or any other transportation. Just walk the mountain and enjoy roads. \n\nYou must go to observation desk of Seoul tower, from there you can see 360 degree view of Seoul.",
          "It's a tower and you look over the city... The view is nice, the area Namsan Park perfect for strolls and runs and the tower itself also not bad with some special features like being able to send a postcard from the top.",
          "Fun place with lots of things to do! Great views from the tower even before going to the top. Taking a cable car to the top cost 9500 round trip , but be prepared to wait in a long line. When you reach the top of namsan, there are locks all \u2026",
          "I just enjoy watching, I love the places and I want to go and visit and  know and see this Beautiful and precious places myself with my own naked eyes by Father God Almighty's Grace. Father God Almighty continue to bless Korea. Amen.",
          "A must visit place!! The view of Seoul city and beyond from the observatory was simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!! Perhaps also my first visit was at night. This time around I had a guide and the weather was good!! Clear sunny skies \ud83d\ude0e",
          "I was sceptical at first on the other reviews but its definitely worth going to visit if you're in Seoul. Fantastic vista of the city skyline, and don't have to pay to go to the observatory to get the views. Lots of places to eat nearby too. Easy enough to get a bus in from the city centre.",
          "Nice view from up there. I recommend to visit the tower during night time. Try to avoid the weekends, we were on Sunday and had to wait in line for hours. \ud83d\ude0e",
          "I love coming here. The cable car ride has a nice view, once there you get an awesome view of Seoul, there is coffee shops and the locks along the gates are just so charming",
          "The best place to view Seoul city. The ride through the curvy road with the trees bloom in a rainbow of colors is worth it. Trip to Seoul will not be complete without a trip to Seoul Tower",
          "Great views over the city. You can walk through a park up the hill if you're feeling like hiking. You can also take a bus up the hill. There is a small shopping mall and cafes at the top.",
          "Beautiful tower.\nEnjoy scenery of Seoul from this tower.\nBeautiful scenery.\nBeautiful lock of love \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Great place to see a view of Seoul for free. Nice walk up - be prepared for relatively steep uphill walking. The VR place inside is a nice touch with a free go available.",
          "A wonderful place where you can enjoy the view of Seoul. Recommended to go at night",
          "If you are a US soldier stationed in South Korea you should take an opportunity to go visit the city a soul\nIs a wonderful city to tour. One of the great highlights of my tour while I was station in Soul at the young son military base , Was \u2026",
          "Visited this place for many times already but is the 1st time with my husband ^^\nThis place is really nice place for sightseeing,  you can walk or go by cable with ticket for cable, the view was really so romantic and lovely for couple, \u2026",
          "Chilling weather but the uphill walk warmed me n latte did the trick. Faster lifts n deck u can locate ur country n its distance. Very good experience",
          "Beautiful view you can see from here..  And many interesting place you can see up here..its a must visit when you come to seoul..",
          "The hotel and rooms are great. The staff is even better. Very helpful concierge.",
          "Very Highly recommended place. It is really beautiful up there to watch and take pictures.",
          "Can't really say you've been to Seoul if you didn't go to N Seoul Tower. So did our obligatory visit to this famous landmark. A lot of tourists, but since we visited in autumn, the weather was perfect for strolling around and takig photos of the foliage.",
          "You can take either by bus or by cable car to get to this place faster. I visit this place on weekdays and there's plenty people there so I can enjoy the scenic Seoul city from the top of the tower.",
          "So lovely place n good resting area.",
          "Great views over the sprawl of Seoul. Well worth doing at Sunset.",
          "A great vantage point near the old palaces but you gotta pay for the cable car and the entrance fee which is not really cheap compared to the service quality. But still it's worth visiting there once. Recommended for those tourists who are visiting Korea for their first time.",
          "Took me 8 years to go to the top but wow! So amazing! Can't wait to go back in the summer!",
          "Good experience with great views. Spent about 2 hours here overall, staff were friendly spoke good english and price was very affordable. From the nearest metro station, there's a shuttle bus that took me up to the cable car station, and \u2026",
          "Tower is located in the heart of Seoul station. There are 2 ways to reach the base of tower; by bus or by a cable car. From base of tower, entire city can be viewed. An high speed elevator takes to top of tower which further gives beautiful \u2026",
          "A little disappointed at the top as there was no outdoor observation deck, but pretty cheap to go up anyway. Enjoyed the base of the tower much more, where the locks were. Would recommend getting the bus up rather than the cable car. Massive queues for the cable car and its not particularly scenic (and much more expensive!)",
          "Nice views and a fun experience overall because of the added rooms and interest when going up the main tower. Also property in expensive. Just a shame it wasn\u2019t a nice day for me! The way the outside area is lit up at night is nice too.",
          "Definitely best at night, when the city really pops out. Affordable, not super busy even at the peak, though we had to wait a bit to go back down as the sunset crowd was leaving. The park at the bottom is really nice and spacious, a good \u2026",
          "A very beautiful place that must be there once, especially in winter days with snow.",
          "I had to wait for an hour to get there with the cable car but it was totally worth it. The place was beautiful with a lot of places to see apart from the observatory deck. Also, the hot cocoa and grapefruit smoothie at Starbucks makes the place look like heaven.",
          "Beautiful view of Seoul from the tower. Lots of people. I was lucky because there were traditional performances on the day I visited the tower. However, it's not a recommended climb if your legs aren't up to it. Even the short climb from the bus stop was tiring because of the steep slope.",
          "The view was awesome! If you are going there for vacation it is definitely a place to visit!",
          "There's a lot to do once your there (restaurants, cafes, arcade, shops, vr games...)  and the view is very pretty. From what I saw there is many way to go up : climb stairs to the top, take the cable car (around 9500\u20a9 two-way and 7000\u20a9 one-way), and the bus",
          "Call place I went at night because I wanted to see the lights of the city definitely worth the trip just a warning though it is 11,000 won per person to actually go to the top of the tower.",
          "Just like any other tower attraction around tge world. You can see spectacular views of seoul. Also get gifts & eat at some very good resturants",
          "Great vantage point to get a view of the Seoul skyline. Took the cable car up. Did not make it at sunset or at night but the day view is great too!",
          "Place is full of people renting traditional Korean clothing so if u wanna have a feel of back to the future can visit this place",
          "A fun experience if you're in Seoul. The views are beautiful and overall nice experience. Don't bother buying package with beer and popcorn because then you're limited to having it in the lower area  (not top of tower-where there is food \u2026",
          "Really good view of Seoul. Don't forget to buy a padlock . There is a small souvenir shop that sells them",
          "Read this if u are going to take the namsan circular shuttle bus. All the buses have already stopped operating even though the official namsan tower website still states that they have free buses. We wasted half a day travelling to the said \u2026",
          "Cold December day, the glass on the observation deck was full of condensation, making it difficult to see outside.  A few shops up there make the light pollution (light reflection, etc) even worse. There are so many love/couple locks \u2026",
          "Nice view of the city and pretty easy to get up to. Had to queue a little bit for the ride. Walked down was also a good experience",
          "This place is really nice! Definitely one of the highlights of my Korean trip! I\u2019m taking stars off because of how pricey the place is! And for that long walk way up, there\u2019s not much to do besides taking in all the sights.",
          "Very good spot to have a 360 view of Seoul. \nGood walk to reach the top or you can use the cable car. The place is quite busy in the day. \nDefinitely unbeatable for an amazing sunset. \nEnjoy!",
          "Expensive but one of the best view. Incredible at night",
          "Get a 360deg birds eye view of seoul city. I purchased the return cable car ticket then realized that actually we can stroll down the hill side and enjoy nice view if time allows.",
          "Nice experience.. it was snowing when we visited.. good view of the city from all directions.",
          "Nice view for the city. Only negative is car parking is extremely costly and bus travel is painful for foreigners since bus drivers don't know English. Tower have good options including hello Kitty museum and Ryan cheeseball experience. Overall good time spend and must see place.",
          "Great view. Prices are acceptable. Take the 05 bus up and walk down. Well worth for the view.",
          "Beautiful view of Seoul from the Tower. There are few food shops as well in case of you are hungry. Few souvenir shops but bit expensive than Seoul city. Going up by cable car is a good experience. \nYou will find lots of love padlocks as \u2026",
          "Amazing ! Was just coming from Tokyo Tower and I must say that the Seoul tower is not short of anything in any ways. \nAbsolutely mesmerizing. The best way to appreciate Seoul that is quiet speed out",
          "Spent a few hours up here enjoying the sights around sunset. We got roundtrip tram tickets which were about 14000 each. We actually didn't go up the Seoul tower because you could see all around the area at it's base, but I'm sure it would \u2026",
          "So many amazing views for photography.. \nSo much adventure here!",
          "I took the bus to get here and i have to walk a bit to get to the locks of love. The observatory was really crowded. I liked it better at the outside and at the locks of love than in the observatory.",
          "This place was just wonderful, from the bottom of the tower to the top, the view is incredible. There are also plenty of shops and activities along the way as well as restaurants. I was impressed by how respectful people were, it was \u2026",
          "We did a photo shoot at the base of the tower ii no traditional Korean garb. The staff were amazing with the shoot and helpful with the touch ups before giving us the photos and a cd with all the professional shots. We had heaps of fun taking our own too.",
          "The best way to get to Seoul Tower is from Kampung Ku... From here you can get to the Tower by using a cable car. Per pax its only 10k won = MYR 35.00 Its only take 15 minutes from the station to the tower. The scenery is so awesome, the \u2026",
          "It has really great view of Seoul city, it was quite breathtaking but I believe the night view would be stunning. Don't forget to visit the toilet too\ud83d\ude01",
          "an excellent spot for seeing seoul city with delicious halal restaurant",
          "N Seoul Tower appears in many K dramas and for a good reason. Picturesque and visible from miles around.",
          "If you are walking UP from the MyeongDong side, from the cable car station, it\u2019s quite a stroll! Take your time. The walk up from Grand Hyatt is much gentler.",
          "I wouldn't waste money going to the top. You can get fantastic views from the top of the shopping complex (at the bottom of the tower) for free.",
          "The best place to see the whole city! So romantic, but very much a couple destination. We took the stairs up to the top. It took a while but so worth it. You can book a trip that includes the Seoul tower and get there by bus. But when you \u2026",
          "The fees are cheap and worth it! For the cable car, a round-trip fee all the way to the top is only about 9,500 won, and you can already enjoy taking pictures there, like at the love locks. We were also lucky enough to be in time to get \u2026",
          "This place for lovers. Who love to put their love lock and show their love forever. View the city of Seoul",
          "Lots of items to buy. Plenty of food. The bathrooms weren't that great or as clean as the rest of the area. The tram to get up to the tower takes quite a while to use. There's a waiting system to get up to the observation deck that isn't \u2026",
          "The view is splendid from Namsan hill without the need to access the tower. Twilight is one of the best moments to take memorable shots",
          "Has a fantastic view with a very reasonable price to go to the top, there are also an awesome video in the elevator",
          "I went to N Seoul Tower for free with my Discover Seoul Pass. Has a nice cafe on the observatory floor. Loved the light experience show just before the elevator.",
          "Not too many to see if you don't plan on going up to the tower.  We went down to level 3 where most tourist don't bothered to go the the stair, but there chairs to seat down and good to watch the city and River view. We spent less then 40 minutes there.",
          "I didn't go to the top but the view of Seoul from the bottom was excellent! I'm sure the Tower will offer amazing views of the city. Was a great run up and down the hill to see it.",
          "Beautiful views of Seoul. Classic nightscape. Plenty of places to eat, drink, shop. The views from the observation deck are ruined by the lights inside. Have to put camera to glass to lose the glare. Hello Kitty island is there. Good places \u2026",
          "Many visitors ride the Namsan cable car up the Mt. Namsan to walk to the tower. Really like this place...",
          "Though we went there during a rainy day, the view is breathtaking on top of the tower.  A  bit of a trivia, the color of the tower indicates the level of the microdust in the area: Good(Blue), Fair(Green), Bad(Yellow), Extremely Bad(Red). \u2026",
          "Best place to chill at night while stargazing on the sky and viewing the whole city. Went there twice and would definitely come back in the future. Best time to visit is around 6pm where the crowd gathers and the queue becomes longer.",
          "Excellent place to visit.  Great scenic view of the city.  The light show before entering into the Observatory was superb.  It was a time well spent.  The Love locks locked onto the gates were also a cool sight to see.  Mwah!!!",
          "When we went up it was too foggy to see any good view of the city but it was snowing and had a very enjoyable atmosphere on top.",
          "Awesome Experience. There is a room before you get to the elevator that has about 4-5 different shows that incorporates the entire room. Very cool to watch them all.  You can stay in that room as long as you want.  Views front the top are \u2026",
          "Good place to visit. You can take the cable car up or you can climb up the stairs. I recommend taking the cable car to go up and taking the stairs on the way down. Once you reach the Mount Namsan, you can go further up to the top floor in \u2026",
          "Excellent place to visit. The room before the tower elevator was very nice and well thought of.",
          "Another tower where you can view the surroundings area, lack info's in English.",
          "Amazing! There are lot of attraction beside observatory. I really like sparkly dark room and lamp show just before observatory. Really worth it!",
          "Tons of fun stuff to do here, the main attraction is paying to go up to the observation deck.  Sunset over the city was nice, it gets PACKED so get here early if you want a window.\n\nThe tram/bus system in the city is amazing. It will take you from your hotel to the base of the hill, the tram takes you the rest of the way up.",
          "I loved it, quiet high & very nicely maintained. When you get into the Elevator to go to the top Light sound effects blast you off into the space ... even the staff will tell you to look up towards the Elvator ceiling. Even when you are \u2026",
          "Nice place, natural, good view of city",
          "This place offers a good view. It is a shame good spot views are blocked by locks.",
          "Good experience seeing the gigantic seoul city fron the top..every sky scrapper feels minute from that height. Photo with seoul tower in background is a sweet memory..and its also not very expensive with i think 13000 won per \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to visit and great for pictures! I recommend taking the cable car. It is fast, inexpensive, and easy! I recommend eating before or after as the food at the top can be a bit more expensive is you're on a budget.",
          "Very good at night! Sunset in park then up tower for city lights.. Good Korean restaurant in tower.. Lovely time.",
          "Definitely worth visiting, good gift store. The view is questionable. Cute pandas at the foundation included",
          "A Beautiful and attractive tower in Seoul south korea. The tower is located at a high altitude. We have to reach the base of tower by cable car which is open up to 10 pm.\nWe can enjoy food and see the whole city view from the tower. Another \u2026",
          "this is nice.  the hill to get to the tower is kinda steep but worth the climb.    The tower lets you see all around the city.  Very nice.",
          "Nice place and good to have some walk!",
          "This is a must go place when you are in Seoul. You will need to either purchase Namsan cable car ticket KW9,000 (round trip), or climb the stairs if you have the stamina. \n\nAfter coming out from the cable, you will reach the Locks of Love \u2026",
          "It would be better if the sky is clearer",
          "View is really good no matter in day or in night. We arrived there around sunset and stayed till night. It has some restaurants, cafes, shops inside. Kakao friends VR is at 4th floor, we had fun at VR games too. We originally planned to \u2026",
          "Amazing, i take walking route in the morning and it's a worth exercises for my body ^^ the scenery too... you will take many pictures while enjoying the nature at every stop point.",
          "A nice scenic escape, but forewarned the lines in the evening are outrageously long for the cable car both coming and going.  I would also recommend ordering your cable car tickets online.",
          "Aside from the climb up to the location (lots of stairs if you're not driving), it was BEAUTIFUL. You get a fantastic view of Seoul, and can sit and enjoy the view. I loved that they also had locks to purchase for you to leave your mark. Try to get there early. Crowds can get there pretty quick!",
          "Observation tower quite okay but I prefer to go to palace. Maybe this is first and last. My daughter like stay at Hello Kitty island we spend 1H and half here to draw and explore the hello kitty island.its hard to use elevator due to many \u2026",

          "The view is probably the most amazing thing about this place. Going up the tower may not neccessarily be the must thing to do :) \nView at night is indeed lovely",
          "You can see the spectacular view of the city. only if the weather is clear (not foggy). unfortunately in our experience it was a little foggy at that time but still you'll be amaze by the view. especially during nighttime. even inside the \u2026",

          "The best way to take in Seoul. You get a true sense of the city up here, definitely worth the trip.",
          "N Seoul tower is almost world best. I think N Seoul tower is better than Tokyo tower, Japan. N Seoul tower's observation can see very wide scenery. And I think N Seoul tower is similar with Busan Tower, Korea",
          "We going in nigth time on winter time on January.and the temperature almost -4\u00b0C.so cold even got freezing.the view from tower is so beautyful evwn in nigth time.than many couple go there to put a \"lock\" in there...the fee for take cable car is \uffe69500/person for round trip.

          "The view is ALWAYS great, but the bus situation was horrible.  There didn't seem to be enough buses running. \n\nThere needs to be MORE trash & recyclable units. One section of the tower, people had just started piling more and more bottles \u2026",
          "I usually come here whenever I go to Korea but I never went to the top of the observation deck. This time I got the discover Seoul pass so I decided to try it. Had to wait about 20 mins for our time group to be called. And then another 15 \u2026",
          "Awesome tower on the mountain! The night here is so beautiful!",
          "Good place to waste a few hours as a tourist. Do not buy the cropped photos. Do not buy over priced souvenirs. Just grab a beer and enjoy the view.",
          "The Seoul tower is good but it's not that long. It's situated on a small hill. The place has traditional dress shop. There is a lock tradition there where couples lock their love by locking on the rail. You can see thousands of lock tied there. But surely lotte World tower has a better view than it.",
          "Absolutely astonishing view. Worth walking up on foot, if you have the stamina. The linea for the cable car can be really long, especially in the evenings.",
          "A little pricey if you plan on going to the top of the tower, as it's roughly $10 for the cable car and another $10 to go inside the elevator, but it is worth it. The view from up there is beautiful. Definitely worth doing at least once. I'm certainly coming back.",

          "Go all the away up to the top of the tower only if you have >4 hours free. Had to wait in a super long line. If you like walking, my recommendation is to walk to the top of Namsan Park (basically the base of the N Seoul tower). This will \u2026",

          "Best view of Seoul 360 is here at the top deck. A sightseeing worth to go if you are in Seoul. Don't forget to visit the \"Locks of Love\" at the stairs of 1F too.",
          "Great place with beautiful views to the city, even if you don't go up to the top of the tower (It's 20.000 won) the views are still pretty amazing and all the colorful locks look so pretty. Also a very romantic place if you have a partner.",
          "The elevator was fast, took only 30 seconds to reach the top",
          "This attraction sits atop a beautiful mountain and park and overlooks all of Seoul.  Getting to the top viewing platform involves a fee, but it's worth it.  Elsewhere in the complex there are nice restaurants that aren't over-priced as food \u2026",
          "Great view make sure to use the cable car unless your ready for a long walk up thousands of steps haha",
          "If you are at Seoul you have to visit this place the views are amazing by day and night, totally worth visiting. Here are some considerations, you have to pay for the cart that takes you up and down of mountain (10,000 \u20a9 round trip) and \u2026",
          "You can see the city from the top. You can either walk up to the mountain or right the cable car, 9,500KRW for round trip. There are restaurants, Game Center and other activities.",
          "Quiet nice place. A lot of photo spots there. All you need is a good angle then just click the camera button.",
          "I really recommend to visit Seoul Tower. I gives you a unique view of this sprawling city. If you have enough time, visit it in both daylight and at night. In the holidays and weekends it is really crowded so be prepared for a long-time waiting.",
          "This is a must-see in Seoul! It's beautiful during the day and an exquisite view of the city at night. It's a steep walk to the base of the tower but stairs and elevator available once you get to the tower. Great dining and shopping \u2026",
          "Not just for lovers but something for everyone. You can take the traditional 4-wheeled vehicle or take the cable car to the tower. \nSunset views  and night views are great. \nFind the name of your city etched on the glass around the tower.",
          "VERY NICE VIEW 17:00 - 19:00",
          "It's so beautiful! I love you @bobbyraneka",
          "Good place to enjoy Seoul view.",
          "Great place to visit in Seoul. Best to go during sun set, astonish views of the city. There is a restaurant and a coffee shop. It is not too expensive to go up the tower to the observatory deck. Take the cable car up and then walk down the path on the way back. You can come with friends or children. 360 view",
          "You can get awesome view from here of Seoul. No need to pay the extra cost of other buildings to enjoy a similar view.",
          "The view is definitely something worth checking out at least once during your visit to Seoul! This park is surrounded by nature and it was nice hearing birds singing in contrast to the cars of the city. There are hiking trails throughout \u2026",
          "You can find a lot of \"love pad locks\" there. Put yours once you're there",
          "We took the bus to NSeoul Tower which was a breeze and took us like 20mins more or less, expect to walk a bit to reach the tower. They also offer cable car ride which leads you to the tower right away, we like the place esp. the lock heart \u2026",
          "Good place to get an idea of how big Seoul is. However, bring enough time since it takes roughly 1 hours to get there by cable car (waiting time 45 min) and same back down. Alternatives are walking, taxi or bus - all significantly quicker!",
          "Nice view. Nice weather",
          "The nicest staircase to the top of a mountain I can imagine. Beautiful views! Come early for the kpop exercise! Five stars!",
          "Amazing views of the city from a central point of view. Choose a clear day before you go up! \nThe best place to see the extents of the city  unless you go up Lotte Tower (which is not centrally located)\nTo go up you can take first the cable \u2026",
          "I looooove south korea",
          "Iconic tower that should not be missed. You can take a bus up to the tower. It gives a nice view of the city. Costs 10000 won, but if you buy the T-Money city pass plus card, it contains a coupon and you can get 1000 won discount. It is \u2026",
          "The best. The tower has a lovely view. I recommend the hike on foot, at least downwards. It is fully illuminated at night (even the mountain road). The way up is recommended to be done at daylight where you will enjoy the lovely park \u2026",
          "Finally I MADE IT HERE !\nOne of the place I want to go on my bucket list !\nAs amazing as in the Korean Drama \ud83d\ude0d\nBought the tickets online as well as the N Burger \ud83c\udf54.\nThe view surrounding was LIT ! Beautiful hill, you can see seoul from above.",
          "It's really a magical place. A must watch if you visit Korea!",
          "Good place its better when yo go there on summer,  if its so cold in winter",
          "Came here with my family. At first we were about to walk to the tower, but from another tourist we knew that it'd take much time and energy since the tower is located on a hill.. so we ended up using cable car. It cost not more than 10.000 \u2026",
          "The view is better at night. Overall experience was okay. There's too many people during our visit which on weekday, can't imagine how pack it can be during weekends. We took cable car (return at 9,500 won per adult) and skip the stairs. \u2026",
          "little expensive but worth a visit.. the views are good\np.s.you are not allowed to take the popcorn upstairs... so if u buy one ..finish it fast",
          "This is the amazing tower in South Korea. This is the first time i have come here so this is so great. The view is very picturesque. You can go up here by bus or van. There are some restaurant here, if you hungry you can try ( hamburger or \u2026",
          "This is the tallest tower in Seoul \nFrom there you can see the whole of Seoul \nAmazing place for taking selfies",
          "It was raining when I went to Namsan, so the views were not as spectacular. I went during Korean Thanksgiving where couples and families were aplenty. I was a solo traveler and I missed my kids. The place had an ambiance not suited for \u2026",
          "Amazing views of Seoul, head there in the evening for some sunset pictures into city night light pictures. I went round so many times to make sure I got the city from every angle! Also so many free attractions around the building, and many gift shops!",
          "Has restaurants at the ground floor. The ticket price is a bit pricey for us.",
          "Very scenic place. You could view almost every place in Seoul. \n\nGreat place for couple & family.\n\nLots of things/attraction here for every ages.",
          "a must place to go with your love couple and do the love lock activities together, dont buy it there but you can bring one from your country\ud83d\ude01",
          "Great views and reasonable pricing, especially if you like to get these Greenscreen photos that you can buy at the top.\nThe way up is stuffed with rooms full of projectors throwing videos and animations to the walls, a lasershow and gift \u2026",
          "good excercise to walk all the way up namsan",
          "Cool views of Seoul. You can't really tell the enormity of the city till you're up there. It's massive!",
          "Best place to visit for views of seoul",
          "It has a nice view of Seoul. Not much to do. There are few restaurants and coffee shops. Better come early in the morning as it becomes too crowded mid day onwards.",
          "Due to holidays cable car was crouded, we walked instead for only 30 minutes going up. It gave us a nice view.\nGoing down the bus station had 1 hour queue so we went down by walking, the trail has good light and lots of people around, pretty safe",
          "Very nice place to view Seoul",
          "Walked over to the cable cars from the hotel.  Took me a little while to find.  Only 10,000  KRW ($8.66) to go to the top.  Cheapest tower I've ever been up.  Thursday afternoon, and although it was not empty, I certainly would not call it \u2026",
          "A nice hike from your hotel. If you aren't so ambitious you can take a cable car up. The hike walks along traditional barrier walls, and the higher you go the better the view. You can pay for a ticket to go up the tower, but honestly you don't get much more value in doing so. There is plenty of food and good views",
          "Wonderful veiw of Seoul city. Lovely walk up and down from the drop off point.",
          "Great weather outside at the deck in winter and feel the breeze, near love lock fence.",
          "It's a nice place to see night view",
          "Quite touristy, but great views and scenery - provides an incredible view of the surrounds. Cable car provides fast access, restaurants are a bit pricey - if you can fight off the hunger pains, there's better food for less in other areas of Seoul. Great couples area to visit, plenty of photo ops.",
          "Beautiful place for a view of all or Seoul. Seoul is much larger than I anticipated. Fun shops and snacks at the tower and the locks was a fun thing to do with my husband!",
          "Bird eye view of Seoul, 360 degree manner. You don't really have to go the the observation deck actually. Hanging around T1 and lv4 is quite good enough.",
          "Lovely, romantic place for couples",
          "Great 360 view of Seoul.",
          "Feel like princess \ud83d\ude48 feel like I\u2019m in K-Drama XD feel special \ud83d\udc97I\u2019m complete my dream and see you next time \ud83d\udc97",
          "Nice place for couple..awww",
          "The place is at an elevated place. Go to N Seoul Tower bear to the evening or before sunrise to see a beautiful sunset or sunrise. And transportation facilities are good too.",
          "The place is awesome for sightseeing as it has a tall structure that you can go up and take photos",
          "Nice place to bring your date here. Rmb to bring your own lock and marker to lock down your relationship at the namsan tower  :)",
          "Very hight and colorful tower, that makes possible to see Seoul from \"another point of view\", showing the magic of the lights of these city. It's easy to reach by feet from Myeong-dong station (just take the street on the right side of exits number 2 and 3).",
          "My wife was very tired on our day tour & nearly passed on climbing here at the tower during the sunset. I'm very glad that I have convinced her to proceed. Great I found the right bus going here. It is because this became one of the best \u2026",
          "What an amazing place. Started from the bottom and hiked all the way to the top and walked past great sceneries. There were Midway stops just for you to take panaromic photos of Seoul but be warned, the climb is not easy. There were crazy \u2026",
          "a great place to photography but come early as waiting time is quite a challenge.",
          "Some fantastic parkland if you decide to walk up.....this is an arduous task and not for the faint hearted. If you're unfit or just a little lazy, take a taxi or bus \ud83d\ude09\nThe tower itself has fantastic views overlooking Seoul and for the more \u2026",
          "Absolutely wonderful but don't take the cable car. Hike up from Hanok village it is wonderful. At the top is just a mall though but the hike makes it fun. I wouldn't recommend going to the top of the tower it costs money and they still just try and sell you stuff at the top.",
          "Ok.just nice.crowded on weekend.theres a shuttle bus from daiso to station but until 8pm.",
          "Wonderful place to take a walk and work out even with your pets. \nAble to take a bus or a cable car to get the top. And there are lots of interesting things to watch. Also able to enjoy the meal with beautiful sightseeings. Its night view from the top is so amazing. (Please check the weather first!)",
          "Great place. Not just city viewing from Tower, but also free graphing viewing of the city inside a special room on your way up.\nCable car not worth it you're. You might as well enjoy thy walk up and down",
          "Very nice place with a wonderful view of the city, especially by night. A must have to do when you come to S\u00e9oul!!!",
          "It's an easily accesible globalbman made  monument with the most beautiful 360\u2022view of the city.  It's a pleasant and refreshing experience .",
          "Amazing place and scenery best place to come espicially with a loved one xD!!",
          "This place is so beautiful \ud83d\ude0d with seoul tower and portrait Seoul city. And you can make lock love. In here you can buy lock with price 12.000 - 15.000 won korea.",
          "Not too expensive, great night time view.",
          "This place well exceeded my expectations! Everyone knows the love locks but at the base of the tower, there\u2019s plenty of view lookouts, a plaza and also a craft market operating when we were there. We didn\u2019t go up the tower as it was \u2026",
          "Surrounded by a lovely 30 minute walk to the top of the mountain, I'd really recommend skipping the bus and doing it on foot. When you get there there's a great food court for lunch and some lovely bars for a beer with a view. Even if you don't go to the top, include this in your day exploring Seoul.",
          "Good, some stairs though! \nDidn't expect to pay for the cable car AND then pay for access to the observation deck -  just seems like a bit of a rip off but all well. \nNice area once up there with cafes, bars and stuff for kids.",
          "Very cool \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\u2764",
          "nice view soul city from here...",
          "The best. Refreshing scenery and really heavenly. My only concern is that since it's a MAJOR tourist magnet and tons of photo-ops, batteries get drained super fast. There was no charging station or any outlet for people to charge their gadgets. So maybe and hopefully they'll think of a way to install some.",
          "I loved the place, but it was abit crowded the day I visited. I had to wait 30 minutes to go up, and 40 minutes to go down. But the view is lovely at night. Recommended !",
          "We get here at night with Bus, it\u2019s not crowded and not so much people around., Theres a lot of things to see, and there a nice view from top where you can saw the city., I don\u2019t regret that we visit at night, because the view is nicer :)",
          "The views are extraordinary. And you may send a letter from the top. Nevertheless, kind of crowded.",
          "A good hike and easily reached by walk or public bus. It offers a great view of the mountainous metropolitan.",
          "I had a \"speedy\" experience while visiting this place because it's already late at night and I just manage to see things and do some window shopping inside the tower. Overall, this place is totally nice if you come in the day. At night, yes \u2026",
          "We walked from the railway station to the top instead of taking the cable car.... Nice environment and manage to view the whole city...",
          "View hazy today but still spectacular. Metallic stamping machine faulty unfortunately. Superb cake and smoothies at restaurant at top of tower. Also fun dressing in traditional garb for photo shoot. Made some great memories.",
          "Fine observatory but a lot of queuing time. I recommend hiking up there and back down since the line for the ropeway is long + I found the ride down a little underwhelming and too crowded.",
          "Good place~~",
          "N Seoul Tower offers great views of the city, as well as some decent food options for your visit. On a clear day or night, you'll have a view of basically the whole city. Keep in mind there's an extra fee to go all the way to the top. Bring \u2026",
          "Although not as tall as other towers in other countries, the walk up to the Tower is very scenic and the contents of the tower are fascinating.",
          "Beautiful views of the city don\u2019t really even need to go up the tower itself as the park at the top of the mountain is also quite beautiful. Gets crowded around sunset but definitely not to the point we felt awkward. Just a lot of people.",
          "It was free to visit the base. Take the cable car (foe a fee) or hike up. Beautiful sceneriea from above.",
          "Beautiful view, even from the base of the tower (going up is 10.000won)\nThere is bus going close to the tower. The road by foot is nice, but there is a lot of stairs",
          "Very romantic destination for couples nor married partners. However, the track to climb up there is inclined and I think not suitable for the old ones.",
          "Nice view. If need exercise try taking the 1km forest mountain trail up the tower!",
          "Nice place but a little bit crowded.",
          "First tkme for me to visit Namsan Tower at night. It's colder and has a different effect. Though I guess night visit is best for lovers! \ud83d\ude09\u2764",
          "It was amazing seeing Seoul city from the top of the observatory deck. Easy to access, you can find many transport options to go there. I think it's best to visit at the evening.",

          "Winter....cold..but interested place to visit if u came to Seoul Korea",
          "The view from the tallest tower in Seoul was magnificent. You can see a different view of southern Seoul and northern Seoul.  The air was clear and many people came here to take a walk and ride a bike.",
          "It's one of those tourist spots you go to, and you do get to view Seoul from the top. Interestingly they allow tourist to graffiti on many areas, leaving their mark and love notes, since apparently they sell these love locks for couples to \u2026",
          "If you expect this wholesale place to give you good deals, you might be in for a disappointment. All stalls have the same pricing and I gotten the same sweater KRW5000 cheaper in Myeong-dong than in Namdaemun.",
          "I walked for 1.5 miles up to reach the top of the mountain that holds the the tower. They should have proper transportation!!!",

          "Very beautiful view of seoul city",
          "After a lovely walk ( yes, not the bus or cable car ) through the lush green forests ( was spring!) to the impressive tower. Many places to snack, drink or restaurants around. Good views but the W10000 ticket to the observation deck gives great orientation of Seoul for a first visitor.",

          "The views were spectacular! Bonus, couples locks for the fence and Hello Kitty store and museum. Downside, be prepared to walk a long and steady step incline. There are buses that drive close to it, but there isn't a smaller shuttle that takes you all the way to the Tower.",

          "Came here at night to long lines going up, dirty windows to try taking photos through and about s 50 min wait for the elevator down.  To me, the trip wasn't worth the effort. Was sadly disappointed.  Hopefully if you have a day trip it's much better.",
          "Must to go there to enjoy a mountain view of a city.",

          "I loved the tower, we went at night and the view of the city all lit up from the tower was incredible.  I did make the mistake of going on a Saturday night though and it was VERY crowded.  The line to go back down the tower was really long and it took forever.  Definitely still worth it though!",

          "The area around the tower is awesome, go and do everything around there, I recommend it. You can go right up to the tower for free. Walk back down, it's a pleasant (if steep) stroll. But the tower itself just isn't worth the price of \u2026",
          "Totally worth it. 360 view + embedded experience before going up. Really nice indeed",
          "Great views of the whole city. A really fun hike to get to the tower too! Thankfully, you take an elevator to the top.",
          "There was too full of people even Sunday night, but was beautiful and fantastic!",

Following a government mandate to globalize Korean universities, the university's international faculty head count peaked at 242 or 4% of the total in 2010, but subsequently declined.Seoul National University, or its undergraduate liberal arts college in particular, finds its roots in the remaining properties from the abolished Keij\u014d Imperial University, one of the Imperial Universities founded by the Japanese Empire. In the 1940s, with US Military Ordinance No.102 of United States Army Military Government in Korea, Keijo Imperial University was abolished. Later the Government of Republic of Korea merged the remaining properties with nine colleges and professional schools, and the consolidated institution was renamed as Seoul National University in accordance with the Act of the National University Seoul enacted in the National Assembly.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-establishment ===\nSeoul National University originates from various educational institutions established by King Gojong of the Joseon Dynasty. Several of them were integrated into various colleges when Seoul National University was founded later.\nTo modernize the country, Gojong initiated the establishment of modern higher education institutions. By means of the issue of a royal order, the law academy Beopkwan Yangseongso has been founded in 1895. It produced 209 graduates including the later envoy Yi Tjoune. Hanseong Sabeomhakgyo (established in 1895), a training school for teachers and Euihakkyo (1899), a medical school, are also considered the origins of respective colleges.\nAfter the proclamation of the Empire of Korea in 1897, Gojong, the then emperor, was motivated to create more modern education institutions. In 1899, a medical school was established. This school changed its name several times to Daehan Euiwon Gyoyukbu and Gyeongseong Euihak Jeonmunhakgyo (Gyeongseong Medical College) and finally became College of Medicine of Seoul National University. In 1901, a department for nursing was established, which was the forerunner of the later College of Nursing.\nDuring the Japanese rule, Keij\u014d Imperial University was established as one of Japan's nine imperial universities. After World War II and the independence of Korea, the name of the university was changed from Keij\u014d Teikoku Daigaku (\u4eac\u57ce\u5e1d\u56fd\u5927\u5b66) to Gyeongseong Daehak (\uacbd\uc131\ub300\ud559, \u4eac\u57ce\u5927\u5b78, Gyeongseong University). The Hanja letters, that were used in the name, were pronounced in the Korean reading and the attribute \"Imperial\" was removed. The renaming of \"National\" was based on the academic nationalism supported by the US military regime in Korea at the time.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nSeoul National University was founded on August 27, 1946 by merging ten institutions of higher education around the Seoul area. The schools which have been merged were:\n\nGyeongseong(Seoul) University (Gyeongseong(Seoul) Daehak, \uacbd\uc131(\uc11c\uc6b8)\ub300\ud559)\nGyeongseong College of Education (Gyeongseong Sabeomhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uc0ac\ubc94\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong Women's College of Education (Gyeongseong Yeoja Sabeomhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uc5ec\uc790\uc0ac\ubc94\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong Law College (Gyeongseong Beophak Jeonmunhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\ubc95\ud559\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong Industrial College (Gyeongseong Gongeop Jeonmunhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uacf5\uc5c5\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong Mining College (Gyeongseong Gwangsan Jeonmunhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uad11\uc0b0\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong Medical College (Gyeongseong Euihak Jeonmunhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uc758\ud559\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)\nSuwon Agriculture College (Suwon Nongnim Jeonmunhakgyo, \uc218\uc6d0\ub18d\ub9bc\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong College of Economics (Gyeongseong Gyeongje Jeonmunhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uacbd\uc81c\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)\nGyeongseong Dentistry College (Gyeongseong Chigwa Euihak Jeonmunhakgyo, \uacbd\uc131\uce58\uacfc\uc758\ud559\uc804\ubb38\ud559\uad50)The first president was Harry Bidwell Ansted. For over a year and a half, there was a protest movement by students and professors against the law of the U.S. military government in Korea merging colleges. Finally, 320 professors were fired and more than 4,950 students left the school. The university's second president was Lee Choon-ho (\uc774\ucd98\ud638, \u674e\u6625\u660a), who served beginning in October 1947.\nThe College of Law was founded by merging the law department of Ky\u014fngs\u014fng University with Ky\u014fngs\u014fng Law College. The university absorbed Seoul College of Pharmacy in September 1950, as the College of Pharmacy. This had previously been a private institution.During the Korean War, the university was occupied by North Korea and Seoul National University Hospital massacre occurred, then temporarily merged with other universities in South Korea, located in Busan.\n\n\n=== Relocation ===\nOriginally, the main campus (which embraced the College of Humanities and Sciences and College of Law) was in Dongsung-dong, Jongno-gu. After the construction of a new main campus in Gwanak-gu in February 1975, most colleges of the university relocated to the new Gwanak Campus between 1975 and 1979. Part of the former main campus in Jongno-gu is still used by the College of Medicine, the College of Dentistry and the College of Nursing and is now called Yeongeon Campus.\nIn 2012, lawmakers reported that the ruling Saenuri Party, prior to the presidential election in December, seriously proposed a plan to relocate the university to the newly established special autonomous Sejong City.  The move came as part of an overall effort to decentralize the capital's governmental apparatus. Originally the national government had approached the university in 2009 to host the building of a satellite campus. It was reported the following year that the university had considered withdrawing from the Sejong plan.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\nAdmissions to Seoul National University is extremely competitive. From 1981 to 1987, when an applicant could apply only to one university at a time, more than 80% of the top 0.5% scorers in the annual government-administered scholastic achievement test applied to SNU and many of them were unsuccessful.\n\n\n=== Academic structure ===\nSixteen colleges of the university offer 83 undergraduate degree programs. For master and doctoral programs there is one graduate school with 99 programs from five fields of studies. The interdisciplinary programs are the ones invented and operated by more than two departments. In addition to that, there are nine professional graduate schools.\n\n\n=== Colleges ===\n\n\n== Campus ==\nSeoul National University occupies two Seoul-based, one Pyeongchang-based campuses: the Gwanak Campus is situated in 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu; and the Yongon Campus is north of the Han River in Daehangno, Jongno District; and the new Pyeongchang campus in Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do.\n\n\n=== Location ===\nGwanak Campus, the main campus, is located in the southern part of Seoul. It is served by its own subway station on Line 2. Yeongeon Campus, the medical campus, is on Daehangno (University Street), northeast Seoul. The defunct Suwon Campus, the agricultural campus, also known as the Sangnok Campus (Evergreen Campus), used to be located in Suwon, about 40 km south of Seoul. The agricultural campus moved to Gwanak in Autumn 2004, but some research facilities still remain in Suwon.\n\n\n=== New plans ===\nIn February 2010 Seoul National initiated a memorandum with the city of Siheung to establish a global campus. Signed with the city's mayor and governor of Gyeonggi for administrative assistance, the university acquired 826 thousand square meters (204 acres) of property in the west-coast economic zone, near the Songdo International Business District, Pyeongtaek harbor, international airport, seaport.The land acquisition will increase the university's size by 58% over its current 1.4 million square meters (350 acres) to 2.2 million square meters (550 acres) and headcount by an expected 10,000 people or 33% of its current figure.  Along with lecture halls and additional liberal arts and graduate courses, the initiative will add a medical complex including a research hospital and training centre, research centre for dentistry and clinical pharmacology, dormitories, apartments, an international middle and high school, and other facilities. Planning to open the international campus in 2014, the university intends to share the initiative with other regional national institutions.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Library ===\n\nSeoul National University Library is located behind the university administrative building in the 62nd block of the Gwanak Campus. In 2009, the library's collection of books, including all the annexes, was 4 million volumes. The chief librarian, Dr. Kim Jong-seo, professor of religious studies in the College of Humanities, took office in 2009.\nThe Central Library has constructed a digital library, which in addition to the regular library collection provides access to university publications, ancient texts, and theses. Included here are images of pamphlets, lecture slides, and insects. The digital library offers access to video of university exhibitions, scientific events, symposia, and seminars.\nThe library was opened in 1946 as the Seoul National University Central Library, inheriting its facilities and books from Kyungsung University. In 1949, the name of the library was changed to the Seoul National University Library Annex. When the main branch of the library was relocated to the Gwanak Campus in January 1975, it was renamed the Seoul National University Library, and then renamed again in 1992 the Seoul National University Central Library.\nIn 1966, provisions were made to systematize the library's collections. The original library was organized into 12 annexes for each of the university's colleges: engineering, education, physics, art, law, theology, pharmacology, music, medicine, dentistry, administration, and agricultural sciences. Two years later, in 1968, libraries for newspapers and the liberal arts were added to bring the number of annexes to 14. However, as the main branch was moved to the Gwanak Campus, the education, physics, legal, theological, administrative, newspaper, liberal arts, and pharmacological libraries were combined in a single building.\n\n\n=== Kyujanggak ===\n\nThe Kyujanggak, also known as Gyujanggak, was the royal library of the Joseon Dynasty. It was founded in 1776 by order of King Jeongjo of Joseon, at which time it was located on the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace. Today known as Kyujanggak Royal Library or Kyujanggak Archives are maintained by Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies (\uaddc\uc7a5\uac01\ud55c\uad6d\ud559\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0, Gyujanggak-Hangukhak-Yeonguwon) at the Seoul National University. It functions as a key repository of Korean historical records and a centre for research and publication of the annual journal Kyujanggak.\n\n\n=== Museum ===\nSeoul National University Museum is located at the Gwanak Campus. It opened alongside the university in 1946 under the name \"The Seoul National University Museum Annex.\" The original two-story Dongsung-dong building, which was erected in 1941, had served as the Kyungsung Imperial University Museum until it was transferred intact to SNU. When the museum was moved to the sixth floor of the Central Library, in 1975, it was renamed the Seoul National University Museum. The museum was then moved to newly constructed facilities, next to the Dongwon Building, in 1993, which it has occupied to this day. Dr. Park Nak-gyu is its director.\n\n\n=== Museum of Art ===\n\nSeoul National University Museum of Art (SNUMoA) was established in 1995 with contributions from the Samsung Cultural Foundation after a proposal from Dr. Lee Jong-sang, a professor of Oriental Art. The building was designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, with construction entrusted to the Samsung Group. The 4,450 square metres (47,900 sq ft) structure lies three stories above and below ground, with its major distinguishing feature, the forward area, cantilevering off the ground. Construction lasted from 2003 to 2005, and the museum opened on June 8, 2006. Dr. Jung Hung-min assumed directorship of the gallery in 2006.\n\n\n=== Dormitory ===\n\nThe dormitory of Seoul National University is named Gwanaksa (\uad00\uc545\uc0ac). Dormitories for undergraduate and graduate students as well as families are located here. It was founded August 1975, with five Gwanaksa buildings and one welfare building, which housed 970 male students. The female dormitory was founded in February 1983. By June 2007, there were one administration building, two welfare buildings, 12 undergraduate dormitory buildings, six graduate students\u2019 dormitory buildings, which in total housed 3,680 students. Unlike other university dormitories in South Korea, there is no curfew hour.\nThe Yeongeonsa located in Yeongeon campus, which is the medical school of Seoul National University. The Yeongeonsa can house 533 undergraduate students and 17 family households.\n\n\n=== University Newspaper ===\n\nThe University Newspaper (\ub300\ud559\uc2e0\ubb38, Daehak-Sinmun) is the students' press of Seoul National University. The first edition of the paper was launched while seeking refuge from the ravages of the Korean War, on February 4, 1952. In 1953 it was moved to Dongsung-dong in Seoul, where from 1958 even editions for high school were published. Financial difficulties in 1960 led the paper to cease printing for a time. It was relocated to the Gwanak Campus in 1975, where it has been in continuous publication until the present day. At the time of its first launch the paper was sold for 500 won a copy, sometimes twice a week. Now, however, it is distributed for free every Monday. The school paper is not available during schools breaks or exams.\n\n\n== Reputation and rankings ==\n\n\n=== Reputation ===\nA KEDI study found that the university's name-value translates into wages that are on average about 12 percent higher than that of any other Korean university. SNU graduates dominate South Korea's academics, government, politics and business. Approximately one in four Korean university presidents studied for their undergraduate degree at Seoul National University. Between 2003 and 2009, more students who graduated from science high schools and received presidential scholarships matriculated at Seoul National University than at eight other leading universities combined.The chiefs of the College Scholastic Ability Test conducted by the government of the Republic of Korea are mainly Seoul National University, and graduates are widely studied in academia, politics and business circles in Korea. At the same time, there is a perception that 'the best university in Korea' or 'the place where the best minds of Korea gather' in Korea while discharging many talented people. South Korea is at the cusp of academics and there has been a claim that SNU should be abolished in order to overcome it. In fact, President Roh Moo-hyun had promoted the abolition of Seoul National University and SNU earlier.[\uc11c\uc6b8\ub300 \uac1c\uad50 60\uc8fc\ub144] 6\u00b725\ub54c \ubd80\uc0b0 \ud53c\ub780\u2026 91\ub144\uc5d0 \uccab \uc9c1\uc120\ucd1d\uc7a5\n\n\n=== International rankings ===\nIn 2015, Thomson-Reuters ranked Seoul National University as the 31st most innovative institution in the world. QS World University Rankings (2016) considers it 35th in the world and 10th in Asia [33, 36], whilst it was 4th in the independent regional QS Asian University Rankings (2013). SNU was 9th in Asia and 85th in the world by the 2016 Times Higher Education World University Rankings [32, 35]. In 2014\u20132015, its World Reputation Rankings were considered it to be 26th globally. Moreover, ARWU (2015) regarded SNU to be among 101st-150th worldwide and the best in the country. CWUR 2016 ranks Seoul National University as 24th best in the world.QS University Subject Rankings (2018): 25th, Arts and Humanities; 16th, Engineering and Technology; 37th, Life Sciences and Medicine; 21st, Social Sciences and Management; 20th, Natural Sciences.\nThe institute was ranked 20th in publications by a 2008 analysis of data from the Science Citation Index, and the following year ranked 8th in the world in clinical trials.\nIn 2011, the Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities reported that Seoul National University is ranked 10th in the world in terms of the number of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune 500 enterprises.\nSeoul National University also had the third highest number of students who went on to earn Ph.Ds in American institutions in 2006.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nThere are issues concerning diversity and racial discrimination against foreign professors at SNU. There was an effort to recruit foreign professors for several years from 2009 onwards, with numbers peaking at 242 or 4% of the total. This number has declined, with a large proportion of the newer \"foreign\" recruits actually being former South Korean citizens who became naturalized as foreign citizens abroad. Many of the earlier batch of foreign professors left after complaining of racial discrimination against them, sometimes without even giving notice. SNU failed to boost its international reputation by offering contracts to Nobel laureates, but they are mostly retired and holding other academic posts elsewhere, are rarely on campus and sometimes leave before their contracts run out.\n\n\n== Notable alumni and faculty ==\n\nAmong its notable alumni are prominent figures in international organizations and businesses such as Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), Hoesung Lee, Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Song Sang-hyun, former President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Lee Jong-wook, former Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), O-Gon Kwon, former Vice President and Permanent Judge in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and Kwon Oh-hyun, CEO and chairman of Samsung Electronics.\n\n\n== In the media ==\nThe campus was used as a filming location for Seoul Broadcasting System's 2008 drama Star's Lover. It was used as the university of Kim Chul Soo's, played by Yoo Ji-tae, employment, his lectures and Lee Ma-ri's, played by Choi Ji-woo, visit to the school. Locations used included the gallery, Kyujanggak, and museum roads. This is the first time the university has allowed its campus to be used as a filming location.In May 2015, the 185th trip of the famous Korean variety show 2 Days & 1 Night advertised the university by holding various tasks on the university campus in the shows very own fashion.In the hit 2016 tvN Korean drama Reply 1988, Ryu Hye-young who played Sung Bo-ra in the drama portrays a Seoul National University student majoring in Math Education.The 2016 hit drama Cheese In The Trap was filmed at Seoul National University.\nIn the hit 2018-2019 JTBC Korean drama Sky Castle, Seoul National University is heavily involved in the plot.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTEPS\nSeoul National University Hospital\nSeoul National University Station\nFlagship Korean National Universities\nList of national universities in South Korea\nList of universities and colleges in South Korea\nEducation in Korea\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSeoul National University, \"\uc11c\uc6b8\ub300\ud559\uad50 40\ub144\uc0ac\"(The 40 years history of Seoul National University), 1986.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)\nOfficial website (in Korean)",

          "Went to The National Musuem of Korea. It is in a beautiful setting with plenty of room for everyone. There was a free concert on when I arrived, playing great jazz. The guy playing the saxophone was great. The Musuem is always worth a visit. Everything is beautifully displayed.",

          "This is a very large museum. The number of artifacts they have collected is astounding. You learn so much about Korea\u2019s fascinating history. I\u2019d recommend a couple of hours to visit this museum. They have many English written descriptions for the displays and exhibits. If you\u2019re",

          "There are plenty of reading materials that they provide in different language as well and it's all for free. They even have these stamp pad that you can roam around and complete as you go along the way. It's amazing seeing them in person as we always see it in the korean tv",
          "The architecture is stunning, the staff helpful, and the exhibits themselves interesting and informative. I got the audio-guide and I spent an entire afternoon roaming through the museum. I think those with an interest in history would certainly enjoy it. The museum itself is",

          "Great activity for hot, cold or rainy days. This place is massive and contains a wide array of artifacts from Korea\u2019s history. This place does tend to get crowded, especially during the summer heat. Getting there: Metro Line 4, Ichon was station exit 2 will take you",

          "The design of the museum is lovely. However, the exhibits can be much improved. We were unfortunate to have visited the museum to coincide with a school visit. With kids out of control, the museum became a market place of voices and vandalism. My heart goes to the museum staff",
          "Wow! Great experience and lots of things to see. Clean. Well-organized. Amazing artwork. Joyful and beautiful landscape. Lots of space. Explored and learned. Thank you for all the people who make it great place of learning and rest.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit. The building is spectacular and the landscape / grounds fantastic. Exhibitions are good. Disappointingly not so much around Korean War and modern history. Perhaps that\u2019s in another museum. There\u2019s a gorgeous area in the grounds worth walking around",
          "By this museum we can learn and understand about korean people. We can take the photo inside the museum but not alllowed to using flash",
          "The museum itself is huge, free of charge, today works till nine o'clock. It has many objects, shop, lockers, clean toilett etc.",
          "We only spent part of a day here. You need more than a partial day as we did not see a lot of the Museum. I highly recommend seeing the Budda section.",
          "Large museum with lots to see. We spent a whole afternoon here. Easy to get to on the underground. The Buddhas were fantastic. Also has a great outdoor garden area.",
          "There's a lot to take in in this museum and I will admit my favorite part was finding cool art prints in the gift shop. There's a lot of pottery, but many other things too. I especially enjoyed the large Buddha statues.",
          "The building alone, along with it's vast gardens is worth a look but once inside, you could spend a whole day. Wonderfully displays depicting the history with plenty to keep the kids interested too.",
          "I visited National Museum of Korea 10 years ago. If you love history, artifacts and arts, then this is a place you must visit. The museum has everything you need to know about Korea's history.",

          "This was a last minute plan. We took the metro and the museum is right there. Free entrance and free guide. Our English speaking guide was a gentleman in his 80\u2019s with a great passion for his country and history. The highlight of my trip was the statue of Sidhartra as a young",
          "If you like history and museums. A must visit. A very large museum and very very clean. Free entry. Only special exhibits are paid. Their 'tea shop' on 2nd floor (at the rear) has excellent and delicious local tea. Reaching the Museum is very easy. You can take Line 4 (Jungang",
          "Highly recommend! I would definitely recommend a guide. There is a lot of amazing content. We hired a personal guide, and it was entirely worth it. The guide drastically amplified the experience. Even if you don\u2019t have a guide, it\u2019s still going to be worth while. I\u2019d plan",
          "This was truly one of the best museums we have ever visited. Extremely well laid out. Fascinating. Took the subway there. Just a short walk from the stop. The museum is laid out in chronological order of the history of Korea. Learnt an awful lot.",
          "There is not much hype on the Museum so we did not plan to visit it at all. In fact, it was only because it was located directly opposite the palace and we had some time before our appointment with our guide, that we decided to pop in for a look. Entry is free. There are",
          "The place is beautiful! i have been there twice and I still feel in awe with the beauty. the collections are nice.",

          "We visited the National museum of Korea on a Sunday. The place was crowded. The museum was a 3 levels place. The 1st floor was all about history and the 2-3 were all about culture and art. The Brochure was available in Korean, English and Arabic. The museum was worth the visit,",
          "This is a new museum, with a great collection of korean art. THe building itself is impressive, and the lightniung is great. A nice pagode gives way to the museum secrets.",

          "This museum is just beautiful!!! Huge, well laid out, architecturally stunning. We took Free English tour. Since there is so much ground to cover I highly recommend the tour as it highlights some MUST SEES. 90 minutes long it goes quick but provides interesting insights.",
          "This museum was very well laid out with the ground floor dedicated to the history of Korea up until the early 20th century. I only had a few hours so I spent the majority of them there so didn't get a chance to see the rest of the museum, but I had a quick glimpse of the first",
          "A good place to bring high school students to visit the museum. However, no information about the Korean War which we are very interested to know more.",
          "This museum is my favorite museum in Seoul, with a vast array of artifacts ranging from ancient times to the era of the Korean War. The museum is educational for learning about the history of Korea, something which is mostly ignored in Western education. Many of the rooms are",
          "The museum offers a decent download of the history of Korea, till the formation of modern Korea. Sadly you wouldn't get to see anything like the impact of World War. Alot of stuff are touch and go, but that is understandable because Seoul also hosts many other related museum",
          "I won't tell anything but suggest all to come here visit and get yourself to learn about the country. Cool place, one of the must-go",
          "i can tell you from extensive travel experience that this museum is a work of wonder. the architecture, organization, presentation and landscape already make it a great place to visit and adding to the fact that it showcases the best of Korea for FREE is a great way to learn",
          "The architecture is great, the way the rooms and lighting (both natural and electric) really highlight the art. There is enough on display that everyone should find something interesting, i was delighted to see the cultural influences of surrounding countries as that aspect is",
          "We enjoyed this peaceful, amazing architecture and all of the many wonders within. You can see so many different periods of Korean history here. From the famous \"Turtle Boats\" of the 10th century through the Korean War and beyond. A balance focus on events and culture.",
          "Subway Line 4 will take you there. Just follow the sign and then walk along the long corridor, you will soon reach the museum. Very spacious and the environment is quite good. Quite true, it\u2019s a bit cool in the sense that there are not too many people and the space itself is",
          "We were so looking forward to seeing Danwon and Hyewon paintings in this museum. It was easy to take matro line 4 to get there. Walking through air conditioned tunnel, we thought it is a great design to avoid the sun light. The museum campus is quite big, well maintained and",
          "Massive museum that is worth a visit - mainly Korean objects but some Asian (particularly Chinese) as well. Plenty of English explanatory notes, and videos and the apps are nice supplements. Layout is reasonably good, and one can easily spend half a day there. Admission is free",
          "It's big museum with an extensive collection of archeological finds and art. Furthermore it's free. There is only limited information on the more recent developments in Korea for which the History Museum of Seoul is a better choice.",
          "The National Museum of Korea is connected to the Ichon Station (Line 4) and a comfortable walk both to the museum and within the museum. While it is a big location with multiple artefacts to keep you occupied, I will first warn that most of the permanent exhibits are of art and",

          "This massively impressive building in Seoul is home to a lot of South Korea's History. The building is made up of three floors and is spilt into a number of different chambers dependent on time periods of various kingdoms/empires including the Japanese colonisation period. There",
          "If you got your history classes in high school (EU students), then most of the information obtained here is repetitive. Nevertheless, it does generally specify on Korea. I would recommend the war museum whocj gives the same information but more specified on their own korean",
          "This is a nicely organized museum. Exhibition is arranged according to chronilogical order. Going through the exhibit halls and rooms taught me a lot about the history of Korea. I may be wrong but the artifacts often looked like recent replicas.",
          "Built in this location in 2005. It\u2019s huge. So easy to get to from the #4 Metro. Signs in the Metro pointing to the Museum. We took the free docent tour. Took about 1:20. Lots of information on the tour. There is a huge breath to the museum. We particularly",

          "Three friends and I visited the National Museum of Korea after spending about a week studying the Korean War, and we all walked away really glad we spent most of our day here. After covering Korean history from 1949-1953, roughly, we felt like we had a much better understanding",
          "If you don't read Korean and are not familiar with Korean history, this is going to be complicated. I walked through it but it wasn't engaging for me.",
          "Unfortunately we were rushed round this stunning museum by our tour guide. It gives a fascinating history of Korea and has many uniquely fascinating exhibits.",

          "On returning to Seoul from a few days in the country we headed here for 2-3 hours before returning the hire car. The place is vast so we didn't do it full justice, but it is stuffed worth Korean treasures from across the ages Professionally presented, well laid out, there is a",
          "Mostly artifacts. A nice, big space but not too interesting. Would have liked to see more art. Don't expect to spend much time here unless you have a keen interest in Korean artifacts.",

          "This is my 3rd time here and I still enjoy it. However, I note that the exhibits hasn't changed much over the years. We didn't understand the English guide much but because he was so sincere, it would have been terrible to fault him.",
          "we went to the museum for a visit. we pre registered for an hour and a half tour. they have yours in several languages. it was excellent. without this you just wonder around and it's too big. it gets you to the right points. so my suggestion us,to do this your and if you want",

          "I thought this was going to be a museum about the Korean War but I was wrong, it covers the history of warfare on the Korean Peninsula since like the dawn of time haha. There are displays of ancient arrowheads and things like that, as well as displays covering warfare in the",
          "This should be the top attraction in Seoul, an amazing museum with huge outdoor areas where you can board warships and get up close and personal to warplanes and tanks! A good place to understand Seoul\u2019s history and the sacrifices made by many nations around the world.",
          "Many may not know exactly how South Korea became the country it is today or why there is so much tension with North Korea but this will explain a lot. There is the usual displays of military hardware but there is a very informative section on the Korean War and how things got to",

          "The memorial monuments on the forecourt acknowledge the roles of other nations in securing freedom for Sth Korea and recognise that the Korean War was a struggle of brother against brother. The comparative size imagery of Sth Korean vs Nth Korean suggests more than just little",
          "Certainly an interesting museum, could easily spend a couple of hours there. Free entry and rather easy to get to. Almost all of the exhibits had signs in English as well as Korean. Unfortunately on my visit some of both the inside and outside exhibits were closed to renovation",

          "This is not a war museum. This is the Korean War museum. It is beautiful and incredible. If you have a heart it will bring tears to your eyes. There are testaments to all of the countries that helped defend them from North Korea, China and Russia. It is a soulful and",
          "Good for an afternoon, loss to see and do. I though it would be a bit boring as really not into war stuff. I was pleasantly surprised, liked walking around all the aircrafts.",

          "A beautiful memorial to honor those who served in the Korean War. It gives awesome insight to what was happening in Korea as well as the world. This beautiful place honors those who deserve honor. Korea is a beautiful place with a sad history. We had a tour guide that said, \"We",
          "Interesting exhibition with a lot of detail in an imposing building. The 4D films are a bit contrived and cartoonish as are some of the rooms, but overall an interesting way to learn about the Korean War.",
          "This is a great place to understand the history of Korea, dating right back to 900BC! Entry is free. You can get here via Samjaki station and you enter on the South side. One full days itinerary could be: 1. Was memorial 2. National Museum of Korea 3. Ichon Hangang riverside",

          "This is a 3F museum with history inside and outside with the inside including history from the dawn of the korean people to the current day practically after the separation of the two Koreas. There is so much information I didnt see it all. Outside there are flags for each",

          "Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones I've visited or know of, all are well presented. It seems little is spared to put on a hood, high quality show. The National War Museum is no different. It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the",
          "If you like war museums, this is the place for you. I learned a lot and was quite impressed with the gratitude expressed to the 21 nations that contributed troops or support.",
          "Last fall, I timed my visit here to coincide with a free Honor Guard Ceremony that took place at 2 p.m. on Fridays between mid-October and the end of November. I found it fascinating to watch the military band, marchers in colorful attire and displays of military precision on",
          "This museum is simply amazing. I could try and describe it but I simply won\u2019t do it any justice. This is a must see for anyone visiting Korea. You won\u2019t be disappointed!",
          "A large number of war exhibits. Both modern and ancient ones. Loved the 4D experience. Such detailed explanations about the history of the Korean war and the course of the war. Makes us gain great respect for the Korean community. \"Freedom is not free\" for sure!",
          "Carefully architected with a beautiful garden. But most of all, it is an entertaining way to get a better understanding of the North/South Korea cease fire that continues from 1950 up until today. If you have no historical background or if you already know a lot, the setup and",
          "From the moment you walk into the building, you can feel the solemnity of the environment. The combination of minimalistic decorations sometimes contrasts with the sheer size of some of the exhibits; giving me always that feeling that peace is easy and simple, but only if we",
          "That\u2019s the poignant catch phrase that sums up the general feel of the War memorial. There are indoor and outdoor exhibits that makes this old school museum a sight to behold. The exhibits are grouped into 2 main rooms - one from the north\u2019s and one from the south\u2019s",
          "Large museum with engaging presentation of historical facts. Outdoor area has real military equipment, including planes, tanks and boats, some of which can be climbed on or in. Indoor area has multiple video displays or 4d movies, as well as standard plaques. A couple floors",
          "This is the place where you will understand everything about the Korean war! Good English speaking guide!",
          "We visited this with a South Korean friend, but missed the English tour - nevertheless, it's an absolute must-see for you to understand the recent history and current climate of this land. We would love to return and join the English tour, but lots of the signs and videos are",
          "Moving, sad and fascinating. Worth a half day visit if you're in Seoul. Closed on Monday's (we made that mistake first time).",
          "This is a poignant reminder of what happened during the korean war. It is very big so allot some time to be able to appreciate this museum. At the back are old planes that were used and a boat where you can go up and take pictures. At the entrance of the museum are the flags of",
          "If you have time to visit this museum you will learn so much about the history of the Wars in Korea. One of the best museums we have ever visited and well worth seeing. Allow at least a half a day or more to make sure you get to see all that the museum has on show.",
          "This museum will teach you all you need to know about the war in Korea and the story behind North and south Korea. You should check it out if you have time for it.",
          "The history of the war is particularly interesting for a visitor from the US. Go, even if you think you won't enjoy it. It's a good experience and you'll know where you are in a more real way.",
          "We got here late so we had very little time to peruse the grounds, but we did have time to see the memorial and find the names of our relatives. It is an amazing place and allows one to realize the full cost of the Korean War to all the countries that participated. I had no idea",
          "The best military museum I\u2019ve ever seen. Korea\u2019s War Memorial has about 650,000 square-feet under roof, and more than 60 fixed-wing aircraft, choppers, tanks, artillery pieces, missiles, and naval vessels outside in the rain. You get a crash course in the history of Korean",
          "It is in fact an army weapons and history museum. Very large and large rooms sometimes complicate to navigate. English. Interesting mini video shows. Nice courtyard.",
          "We are Turks and we are proud of heroes that live with us forever. All the nations that are included in the war are seen with their names, flags and clothes.",
          "Visited here for two hours and I wish I\u2019d been able to spend more time. Very impressive memorial with lots of displays covering centuries of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Goes well back in time, not just focusing on the Korean War. Great displays everywhere.",
          "I visited the War Museum of Korea with 3 teenagers in August 2019. They are not big fans of any museums or history related places, but they really spent good time there. It was not boring at all. The architecture of the War Museum itself is amazing and the display was quite",
          "I learned a lot just this museum visit. Very well laid out and there is a great deal of information presented. Spent about 2.5 hours there and could have spent a few more. Very well designed museum and worth a visit if you're into history or just want to understand more about",
          "A beautiful, sad museum, which summarizes Korea's history of wars through the ages, including airplanes, tanks and weapons from the war of the Korea's in 1950. There are signs in English, a clear sense of order, and the place is very respectful of the sacrifices made.",
          "Very interesting museum but the wonderful visit were wasted by some racist worker. As we were waiting for the line for an animated room (incheon landing 4D simulation) with a 15 people capacity and 30minutes long waiting line between the sessions, the staff member who were in",
          "It will be interesting for those who are interested in the history of Korea. Very informative! Many rooms with exhibits, there is a real combat equipment Equipped area for watching documentaries about the war in Korea.",

          "This museum was included in our Seoul City Tour company's tour of N Seoul Tower, Hanok Village and Korean War Memorial. This museum is a Traveler's Choice Award museum and it does deserve this. This is a huge modern multi media museum that was free to go into. I concentrated",
          "Very educational.on work day wasn\u2019t crowded.loved everything especially outside!lots of pics and fun!",
          "On a rainy day museum was crowded, noisy kids running around. Worth to visit still, I learned a lot of Korean war history and felt nice how they remembered for example all UN partners in Korean war. Intresting how they linked modern technology with paintings and sculptures.",
          "This is a must-see if you are visiting Seoul. Especially if you are interested in military history. It takes you through all the military conflicts involving South Korea.",
          "A huge memorial location with many exhibits to view. Easily a half day tour. Food in the attached restaurant was good and reasonably priced, Well worth a visit.",
          "Honestly one of the best Museums I have been too! Well spaced out, clean and taken care of. You can feel the respect for their history in the information and atmosphere you see and feel. No charge but donations welcome. Free English speaking tour at 10am & 1pm, we unfortunately",
          "Sadly, Korea's history has been marred with warfare over the centuries. But this museum is a great collection of this history with artifacts, interactive displays, and panoramas that take the visitor to some of these battles. Also interesting to note are some of displays on",
          "Wasn\u2019t too sure what to expect from this museum, but upon arrival we were blown away by how massive the place is. The museum was really large inside and out, with lots of exhibits to look at, interactive ones as well. A lot of in depth rich history and there\u2019s even free",
          "Was great to learn so much about the Korean war and the struggle the KoreN people had to go through after that to become who they are right now.",
          "Huge collection, spanning early Korean history to most recent conflict in the Gulf. As expected, there is a significant focus on the Korean War, but there is much, much more. The outdoor exhibits are extensive, including a B52D from the Vietnam War. The memorials are",
          "My family of eight visited Seoul in June 2019. We had never been to Korea before and didn't know quite what to expect. We chose the War Memorial because of our interest in history and the Korean War specifically. We weren't disappointed. The museum is well laid out and there is",
          "We were here a half day and did not nearly see it all. We started with the outside area first coming upon the Clock Tower of Peace and then the Statue of Brothers. From there we visited all the outdoor sights and particularly the Open-air Exhibition Area. On a warm May day I",
          "We spent a half day in the museum. We were with our 20+ year old sons. Shortly after arriving, we drifted apart and did not see each other for a few hours. We all found things that captivated our interest. Lots to see and learn. Very well done displays and explanations.",
          "I was not expecting much about this place, but was surprised to see the indoor and outdoor displays. They have a lot of tanks, artillery, fighter jets, and even a huge air force B52 bomber on display. There is also the coast guard cutter that still contains all the holes",
          "The museum provides a well illustrated history of the painful Korean war. You leave the museum a lot wiser than you arrived. Certainly in terms of the events of the war, but perhaps more interesting, you have a much better sense of the pain and deep wounds this meaningless war",
          "Excellent, very educational place to visit. Free admission. Be prepared to spend about 3 hours there. It is about 5 to 10 minutes from the subway station. The signage at the subway station exit is not so clear though, can certainly be improved. The museum is huge. At the lawn",
          "We visited the War Memorial of Korea today. It was my second visit and it is well worth the time to explore. The building and grounds are beautiful and full of war relics. From prehistoric weapons, displays from different eras in Korean history to the high-tech displays to",
          "Attempting to find one's way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor (exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest, line 4 more difficult). The memorial itself, however, is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a",
          "The area is big and there is a lot to see and learn. No entrance fee and you can learn a lot from the exhibit as there are a lot of things to see, hear, and experience. Suggest to put this in your agenda when visiting ROK.",
          "There is a Memorial Hall for those who have passed from service in various Wars of Korea. Also there are military vehicles such as planes, ship, tanks and others where you can take photos or get a closer look. Within there are exhibits for the various wars Korea was involved in",
          "A total look at Korea at war from early time through Japanese imperial invasions to present day. Well worth the visit.",
          "As war museums go this was all the encompassing for the Korean Peninsula. Korean friends back home stressed that we must see this. Well, there is a fair bit of jingoism here and I can see why Koreans feel strongly about it. If stressed for time, this is a miss.",
          "If you plan on coming here then don\u2019t be rushed! There is so much to see. We had to plan well as we were on a time limit. We visited the rooms about the Korean War which were really informative and interesting. The English is just fine. They have rooms on further back in",
          "This place not only documents the Korean war, but also pays tribute to all the nations that sent their sons to fight for the Korean people. Very moving.",
          "For most of us who are uninitiated about the Korean War, you mostly think of it as a US war like Vietnam. However the War Memorial of Korea really open your eyes that it involved the UN and China. The museum doesn't just focus on the Korean war - it highlights how Korea fought",
          "Initially I thought this museum would just be focused on the Korean War but it went into a lot more details on other historical battles waged by long ago Kings. Outside there were a number of memorial statues as well as a large assortment of aircraft, rockets and fighting",
          "The outside memorials are, in my opinion, the best part of the whole thing. The statues and installations are very moving and well designed. Inside the Korean War exhibits are very well put together, and take you through each year of the war, the help received by various",
          "When you're interested in Korean history, this museum is a must visit. However, I found it a bit dull. The information was presented very simple, without any 'extra's.' I think I expected more information about the course of the war. The information could have been presented",
          "A beautiful interactive display of history that gives you opportunity to understand the importance of what it means to fight for your freedom. War is scary but this gives the opportunity to be guided through history to understand the changes and development of people during the",
          "Very nice to visit if you want to learn about South Korea's history. Lots of military plane, tanks, etc. to see and take pictures here.",
          "We came after lunch to the War Memorial. It has excellent programs that explain the war and the international coalition that brought the North Korean-Russian-Chinese forces to armistice. There are lots of details for those who love details and it is easy to choose what to focus",
          "Great, free, museum about conflict on and over the Korean peninsula from ancient to modern times. I spent 2.5 hours here and still didn't see, read everything. A wonderful mix of multi-media (movies, actual US/ROK and captured equipment, wax museum like staging, and other",
          "It's huge and they have put in a massive amount of time and money. If you are interested in this kind of stuff allow a full day. If not spend an hour or two and see what you want. Probably the most informative museum in the area and its all free.",
          "There is a lot to see at this museum there are old tanks and aircraft and more on the outside and inside There is no fee to this museum and it can easily take a day to see everything They give you a lot of historical information on Korea and the US and it is near Yongsan US",
          "As I had some free time left in Seoul, the War Memorial seemed a good place to visit as a follow-up to visiting the DMZ. Although I'm not really interested in military history, I found an impressive and informative range of displays on the history of war on the Korean Peninsula",
          "I visited this as a last minute decision, heard the announcement on the hop-on-hop-off bus and figured I would check it out. It turned out to be a good decision. The museum is very modern and well organized with a lot more exhibits than I ever expected. There are 3 floors inside",
          "Fantastic museum. Well worth a visit. You need a few hours to have a good look. Very easy to get to on the subway.",
          "Spent a few hours at the large free memorial. Amazing collection of items from the war. The largest I have ever seen at a single museum on the war. Provides detailed history of the conflict between North and South Korea.",
          "A wonderful memorial to those who were lost in the \u201cforgotten\u201d and continuing war. This memorial gives you a feeling for the losses suffered by the Korean military and civilian population which escapes Mose Americans. A Highly recommended stop.",
          "This is quite amazing. Its free and it tells the story of war through the ages. there are lots to look at and many movies explaining the history of the Korean empire. It tells every aspect of the story even the peace keeping aspect of the Korean military. I was very moved by the",
          "Well....it definitely IS a WAR museum. I found it simply obnoxious. We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game. It was a 4d movie! Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye.... ok.... not my idea",
          "Spent the morning there and it's a must to see. It's wonderfully kept for you to wander around and take in the past. It brings it home to you what South Korea went through and how many countries were involved. It also reminds you that it was one of the poorest countries after",
          "A stunning circular memorial plaza, surrounded by black marble plaques detailing all the names of the ROK dead. The museum details the geo-political background and build up to the war in 1950. Too much to mention, good exhibits all detailed in Korean and English. Lots of",
          "Very well done war museum that tells the story of all of the wars Korea has faced in its history. But for Western visitors, it's sufficient to focus here solely on the exhibition dedicated to the Korean War. It's a great place to learn about the war that essentially brought the",
          "Excellent museum - It's part memorial part museum. While there is always some sombre moments visiting a war memorial, I found this one to be very well designed and tourist friendly. It tells the story with easy to follow layout and exhibitions. Highly recommended to anyone with",
          "This was my highlight in my trip to SEOUL. Fantastic military equipments on the outside and very informative musseum on the inside. Btw, admission is free.",
          "An excellent museum to learn about Korea. Great exhibits and storytelling. Entrance is free and you can download an audio guide when you get there using their free Wi-Fi. There's some focus on wars, but lots of general history as well. Explains a lot about why the country is the",
          "Covers everything from thousands of years ago to the present conflict, with a surprising amount of depth in any area. Would be good for kids or especially for adults.",
          "I visited with my friend from Australia. He didn't have any knowledge of South Korea. I thought this place just explain about weapon or flight of war something ... I have been there, but I didn't remember well. And I knew I was totally wrong. we had 5 hour there but it was not",
          "The museum is quite big it will easily take 4-5 hours to go thru all. So we joined a hour guided tour. Very good. Now we understand more about the history and how the Korean people were suffering. Is a MUST if you wanted to know the history how north and South Korea were",
          "One of the great things about the museum's in Seoul is that most of them are free to include the war Memorial. It's easy accessible by metro, it's huge with great visual history on the inside and has a large park on the outside. It's one of the best museums that I've been to.",
          "Really glad I spent a few hours at the War Memorial. So moving. There are free tours in English (one in morning (10?) and 2pm. Many audio visuals to make it interesting, and worth visiting the outside just to see the monuments. Bonus--beautiful cherry trees in the area.",
          "Before heading to the DMZ pay a visit to this museum. You need to understand the histoty of this torn country.",
          "This monumental building is indeed a monument or memorial, and does not include a lot of guns and other military hardware. This contrasts with the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which despite its name, is mostly filled with the machinery of war. More English lsnguage",
          "I\u2019ve been to many number of war memorials and military museums: this takes the cake. Huge collection of both Western and Soviet vehicles (tanks and aircraft) outside. The inside of the war memorial is touching, and appropriately conveys the loss of life in the Korean War. It",
          "We stumbled upon this on a rainy afternoon when looking for something to do in the area. We arrived late afternoon to find it filled with School children but they soon left. The outside was filled with war vechicles such as tanks and planes and you can easily wander between them",
          "Great museum, lots of cool exhibits. Great service and very tourist friendly. Free & no cost which is great. Must visit if you come to Seoul! Learned lots about all the wars Korea was in and Korean history! :)",

          "I\u2019m a huge of General history, so this place hit the spot. And it\u2019s free! There are warring vehicles outside the museum and a little bit more inside. The place is massively huge and it may take a full day to finish the entire place. There are a couple of 4d theaters with limited",
          "This is a must see if in Seoul. The museum was very artfully done and told the history of war in Korea. I am not a fan of war museums but this one was amazing. I loved all the different visual effects and felt they did a wonderful job of recognizing the refugees of the wars and",
          "For history buffs like myself, you should set aside at least half a day for this sprawling war memorial and museum. The outdoor section includes symbolic monuments, planes, tanks, and a 4-D video exhibit about heroic South Korean sailors which made me tear with emotion. The",

          "What can you say about war memorials? It\u2019s a memorial, not a museum. It\u2019s a must visit, but we didn\u2019t stay more than an hour. Wouldn\u2019t visit again, but would recommend to friends.",

          "The outside is just as good as the inside. Powerful sculptures, a massive amount of relics, flags and number served from each country, wall of remembrance. Inside is also great, but if you were on a tight schedule, you could easily walk the outside and grasp the depth of",
          "I lived in Seoul for five years and visited the Memorial several times and went on the narrated tour. The tour was great. Don't worry if you don't speak Korean the tour is given in multiple languages. It gives a real insight of the Korean War and the suffering the Koreans",
          "This was on our to do list for our one day excursion to Seoul and it was definitely worth the time. It is a tribute to those who fought and died during the Korean war.",

          "It was nice. I feel like I went back in time. You can see how war affected people then, and still today. So many lives were lost, and I feel nostalgic going here. The layouts of the sections of the history were easy to navigate. I like how the rooms connected to each other. It",
          "A very good place to learn about war in Korea. But the downside is that since the visual is kind of real and they make the wax image and all, it can be kind of depressing once you visited the museum. But still it really worth visiting~!",
          "The museum is quite huge. It is split in many parts, with one part focused on the World War II. The museum is entirely translated in English, and there's various documents and items that are available to see.",
          "As a person without that much knowledge and detail about the Korean War since it is not taught in schools here, this place was great. It is not only informative but it is presented in such a way that it makes you want to learn while still presenting the truths and horrors of",

          "Great memorial a must see. So many little details about the memorial that you have to ask the attendant. So many things have significance like the number of soldiers the echted faces on the wall. Go and be respectful.",
          "Spent a good few hours here, there is so much to see and so many pictures to take. Absolutely amazing, the workers there are so friendly, gave me a couple of leaflets to explain the history. It really does touch you. So if your interested in history I totally recommend this",
          "If you like airplanes, canon, tank, etc. It\u2019s a really nice place to visit! It\u2019s free and there are a lot of machines that you can see or even touch!",
          "I am not a huge history buff, but this memorial/museum is extremely well done and informative. The memorial statues are well done, the old tanks and planes interesting to see, and the museum gave me a concise overview of the Korean war and history. You can only shop and eat so",
          "Another place to give you a complete review about Korean Hystory. Don't forget to pick a war chronicles book at the entrance, it is fee. Lots of pavilions with several war itmes ... places ... cars ... And of course tons of Korean History details easy to go thru.",
          "A sobering look at the geopolitics of the Korean peninsula. Ignore some of the South Korean propaganda and you'll get a great perspective of what makes Korea tick. Walk through all the floors to discover fascinating history of Korea. I would suggest going to this place first;",
          "Sombre and wonderfully curated. I learned about the history of war on the peninsula and the events of the Korean War. The outside a with the tanks planes and such was really neat too.",
          "It's a weird scene -a lot of one-sided displays, some really cool military hardware, juxtaposed against mobs of schoolchildren all over the place. Not really schoolchildren -we're talking barely kindergartners if that... oddly posing with cartoon characters right next to massive",
          "Gives an outsider a better understanding of why North Korea exists and how american culture has influenced South Korea. Must visit",
          "This museum is very well done and maintained. Tours in other languages including English are free 2x a day. The tour is very nice. A retired ROK colonel gave us the tour. Tour runs 90 minutes. Great displays inside and out for kids. Retired planes, tanks, parachutes you",
          "Much more than a war memorial (that part us actually the less interesting one) - huge museum with many exhibits not just on the Korean War but also all aspects of Korean military history throughout the ages. Lots of military hardware on display, and most exhibits have English",
          "Quite an amazing place. Amazed to see such a selection of aeroplanes, tanks, rockets and even a boat. But then the memorial with all the names of those who died, together with the complete history of the war is very solemn. Well worth visiting.",
          "We started off with the outside expositions. There are two exhibits and many planes, tanks, 2 small boats and 1 large you that you can board and visit the insides. We watched the 3D movie after visiting the boat (I'd recommend watching it beforehand). Turns out it's the exact",
          "Definitely a place to visit when in Seoul. The admission is free and the museum has something for everyone. Outside there are several airplanes and tanks to observe. Each one has a sign explaining what it was used for during the war. Near the ship there is a 3D movie",
          "this is good for History buff. its has a lot material to see and understand the history and ancient Korea.",
          "This was not like so many other war musems in Asia.It was an historical trip, so respectful to those who gave their lives.No gory photos etc. or propoganda.Sad statute of 2 brothers, opposite sides, embracing on battlefield.Also wall plaks with names, so many. A class place.",
          "Impressive Museum with extensive memorial. Names of all the fallen soldiers and their country of origin listed. Info in English, free entrance. You could spend a few hours, there is also a cafe.",
          "You could easily spend an entire day in this museum and still not see everything. There were renovations being made to the pavers in front of the main entrance when I visited, so I sort of came in on the side. That gave me an opportunity to view more of the monuments outside,",
          "I am no so fan of museum since its hard to understand but this place it is worthy to see it! Inside all the story it's explained about the Korean war and if you don't have time you have outside all the planes and tanks from the war. Also the memorial itself is stunning!!!",
          "It is really impressive,especially for nationalists and military people.First of all its free.They have the arms ,thanks and planes of both sides,that includes russian,chinese and american arms.Koreans are equal to all countries that shed blood for south! As an example,us lost",
          "It put the history of Korea in context for me starting from prehistoric times to current. It made me realise that invasions and wars not only shaped Korea but the whole world. I found it extremely interesting both inside and the external displays of military machinery.",
          "* Spent most of the day there * Outside area with tanks, planes and rockets * Very comprehensive history of the Korean war, plus one floor dedicated to the earlier history, including Japanese occupation * Impressive building * 4D cinema show * Nice grounds with water and gardens",
          "Only the view on this musea is allready imposant. The expositions are respectfull to the history and give you A lot of information about the korean war. The lost of soliders and also the UN soldiers is many. You will vind all the namens of the Dutch lost I recomended to visit",
          "Very detailed, interesting and interactive museum on the Korean War. While it is sometimes a bit biased in its presentation of the Korean War and aftermath it's much less the case than expected. A must do in Seoul!",

          "This place is truly beautiful. First off, it\u2019s FREE. What a great place to go for no money at all. It\u2019s educational, and coming from someone who HATES war museums and such, this was actually really interesting. The art was incredible in the memorials. Absolutely stunning. And",
          "Real tanks and rockets display outside are the highlight for me. But the Museum itself is very informative, clean and organized - a lot of things to see like the turtle boat of Admiral Yi. Very child friendly. We spent 4-5 hours there. Highly recommended.",
          "It's an interesting place to spend a couple of hours. I like how they emphasize the costs of the war to the ordinary families. A good educational experience.",
          "Each time I return to Korea, this is a must see on my list. This year for the first time I took my wifre. This is not a day to rush. Take ypur time, look and read. The displays inside and out ate second to none and the constant upgrades with technology have made this a must see.",
          "Never thought to stop at this war museum, just because of the jet fighter outside of the museum that you can see when bus passing by that place. I just walk alone in this area start with the all the warrior names. Than start to explore all the hall and this museum is awesome,",
          "This museum was very informative and being an American whose grandfather fought in the war, it was very touching. The Korean people are very thankful to the UN for fighting alongside them. I learned a lot about the war, as did my boyfriend who is a history buff.",
          "Most poignant was the statute of 2 brothers embracing on the field of battle, one fighting for the North and one for the South, standing on a dome with a crack in it representing the division of the Koreas. A number of airplane including a B52 bomber as well as a Korean made",
          "This place is amazing and FREE! They even offer a free book on the Korean war. You can donate upon exiting, which I did. Outside, the different monuments are accessible to all and in the building itself there are different permanent exhibitions all wotrh a visit. I only spent",
          "You'll feel a range of emotions going through this place. The dome with the crack down the middle, two soldiers on top embracing, that is something that will hit you hard. The planes, tanks, guns, etc are great for the kids. The part that hit me the hardest was they have the",
          "The history starts from the ancient age to till the 1953. Anyone can live the history in this place. Inside the museum don't miss the tear drop and outside the peace and war statue.",
          "This was one of the stops on our bus tour and it looked nice on the pictures, so we decided to give it a try. It is really informative and very well done. Good for kids too, as there are many things to see for them (planes, boats etc.). We didn't go into the museum, just walked",

          "I visited this place because it had high reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not expecting too much of it but it was a great experience. I was just disappointed by the national Museum and this memorial saved my day. Totally worth the visit and plan 3 hours at least to go through it.",
          "I took the English tour at 14:00. I visited here before long time ago, so do not recall what I saw at that time. Couple of years ago, I felt too huge to visit so I visted only the outdoor exhibition. The tour takes alsmot 1 and half hour, the volunteer explain quite well about",
          "We thought it was going to be a quick trip but stayed all day. There are so many things to see and lots of english to read. The statues were fantastic and the whole day was well spent.",
          "We recently visited Seoul for a week and has the opportunity to visit The War Memorial of Korea and I'm so glad we did. The the Memorial is as much a museum as it is a memorial. It is incredible collection of uniforms, equipment and weaponry used by the countries that were",

          "We were really impressed with how interesting this museum was. The building itself was huge and was architecturally significant in itself. The memorial spanned over a few levels and was quite creative in how it presented its information. There were large scale replicas, video",
          "Went expecting to be there for a couple of hours Five hours later we had to leave as we had other things to see And we only scratched the surface Expected to focus on the Korean War but this place is about so much more, from 'ancient history' to current conflicts and",

          "Our visit lasted almost six hours. The first hour was spent outside, in extremely cold weather, looking at aircraft, tanks, missiles, bombs, trucks, helicopters, and even a war ship from the last 100 years. Very impressive outdoor memorials that are worth visiting as well.",

          "As an history buff, going to Seoul without being to the war memorial is half the experience. The museum was well organized with great exhibits. The only down side was the fact that for some attractions, curtain hours are available. So you cant always explore every aspect of it.",
          "I have been to Korea so many times but this is the first time I've been here and I was really shocked that I have not visited before. The place was really amazing. The grounds is so big and the outside exhibit simply took my breath away. From the war planes, tanks and",

          "Impressive. Quite a distance out the city, we were surprised at the size of the grounds the memorial/museum is. We were also surprised at the amount of security here and in Seoul in general but unbeknownst to us Donald Trump was in town. One of the best attractions in Korea,",

          "Lots of information. Lots of artifacts. Having only a general knowledge of the conflict in Korea when I went in, I felt like an expert when I came out. And the helicopters, planes and tanks...hard to believe that fit all that in central Seoul. Good place for adults and",

          "Worth visiting, should be combined with the outdoor exhibition of airplanes and combat vehicles next to the museum (which includes things from a B-52 via a copy of a sunken ROK patrol boat to tanks) which is quite interesting as well. For the very interested, the war museum",

          "They have many great statues, monuments and military hardware outside but the main reason for going is to learn more about the Korean War. The building is large and the information comprehensive without being overwhelming. It succeeds in giving the details and facts, as well as",
          "This Memorial (and museum) are incredibly done. Outdoors there are tons of old ships/planes/weapons with an explanation of each. There is a memorial wall to all those who died in the Korean war, listed by country and further by US State. Good history of Korea during different",

          "A very informative museum. The outside display of tanks and planes was very interesting and gave a good perspective. Inside (all free) was history of war throughout Korean history (which was very informative). The 2nd and 3rd floor was dedicated to the recent Korean conflict",

          "I've been to a few war memorials, and this one doesn't disappoint. I went to the Victorious Fatherland Memorial in North Korea, so it was good to see the otherside. Note: there is a bit of bias (as one would guess), so make sure you come in and reserch anythign that seems a bit",

        "wiki": "Lotte World Tower (Korean: \ub86f\ub370\uc6d4\ub4dc\ud0c0\uc6cc) is a 123-floor 555.7-metre (1,823 ft) skyscraper located in Seoul, South Korea. It opened to the public on April 11, 2017, and is currently the tallest building in South Korea and  the fifth tallest in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter 13 years of planning and site preparation, the tower gained final approval to start construction by the government in November 2010 and the first groundbreaking activities of piling and frame assembly were observed at the construction site in March.\nAt New Year 2016 the LED-pixels of the facade showed \"2016\".On April 2, 2017, Lotte shot off fireworks to celebrate its official opening.\nOn Jan 1, 2018, Lotte shot off fireworks with LED laser show for 7 minutes to celebrate New Year's Day and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Design ===\nIn 1989, the first design was made and there was a plan. Design changed again in 1994, 1995 and 1997. The design that came out of the second Lotte World in 2002 was similar to that of France, which literally copied the Eiffel Tower. Following the revision of the bird's eye view from 2004 to 2006, the bird's eye view was changed seven times in 2008 and the design was changed in 2009 and the Lotte World Tower began to break ground.The Shard of England is said to be similar in design. The Shard, the design of renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, was launched in 2008 and completed in 2012 and opened in 2013. Its interior and elevator atmosphere are similar. In addition, space externally on the roof tower is similar.\n\n\n=== Height ===\nOn March 17, 2016, prior to the final phase of external construction, the Diagrid lantern-shaped roof structure was completed. The roof structure was constructed with steel counterparts that are each 12 meters and weigh 20 tons. The counterparts were made up of bent metal panels that are 6 cm thick, and the structure itself is 120 meters high, and it covers floors 107\u2013123. Approximately 3,000 tons of steel parts, a high-precision 64t tower crane, high-precision GPS alignment systems and highly skilled welding technicians were used in the construction of the roof itself. The roof structure is engineered to withstand its weight without reinforcing pillars, and endure earthquakes up to a magnitude of 9 under the Richter magnitude scale and winds up to 80 m/s.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nLandmark\nLotte World Tower is a landmark in Seoul. It is the first 100-story building in Korea. As of its completion, it was the fourth-highest tower in the world and the highest in the OECD countries. The conceptual design calls for a slender cone with convex, gently curved sides. An exterior of pale-coloured glass draws inspiration from Korean ceramics and features accents of metal filigree.\n\n\n== Floor plans ==\n\n\n=== Main facilities ===\nSeoul Sky is located on the 117th - 123rd floors of Lotte World Tower in Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Korea. The 117th floor is the entrance floor and the view floor; the 118th floor has the Sky Friendly Cafe and Sky Terrace; the Photozone on the 119th floor; Seoul Sky Cafe on the 122nd floor; 123 lounge, which is a premium lounge bar, is on the 123rd floor. There are four media stands on the 117th and 118th floors. The view floor has prominent views of the city, as well as a glass floor and a telescope. The sky skylight of Seoul Sky was the highest glass floor observatory as of the tower's completion. Lotte Tower and One World Trade Center have concluded an operation and technical service agreement.\n\n\n== Issue ==\n\n\n=== Urban exploration ===\nIn 2016, two Russian and Ukrainian urban explorers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov from Ontheroofs, illegally climbed the under-construction Lotte World Tower through stairs and Vitaly Raskalov then free-climbed up the crane on the tower's top.\nThe video was viewed over 3 million times as of September 2016 and received worldwide media attention. \nFollowing the climb, Lotte World Tower released posters with the photos of Vitaly Raskalov and Vadim Makhorov and banned them from the building.\n\n\n== Incidents and Accidents ==\n\n\n=== Safety issues ===\nIn 2013 and 2014, three construction workers died during the construction of the tower, and an executive director of Lotte's construction arm was given a suspended sentence of eight months in prison in 2016 for his role in neglecting safety measures at the site. In December 2014, the Seoul city government ordered the mall and cinema complex at the base of the tower, which opened before completion of the tower, to be closed for five months after water was found leaking from an internal aquarium. Independent engineers who assessed the building found that these issues bore little relation to the overall structural integrity of the building and the mall and cinema complex reopened in 2015.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBusan Lotte Town Tower\nList of buildings with 100 floors or more\nList of tallest buildings in Seoul\nList of tallest buildings in South Korea\nLotte World\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLotte World Tower Official Website",

      "name": "Dongdaemun Design Plaza",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Dongdaemun Design Plaza, also called the DDP, is a major urban development landmark in Seoul, South Korea designed by Zaha Hadid and Samoo, with a distinctively neofuturistic design characterized by the \"powerful, curving forms of elongated structures\". The landmark is the centerpiece of South Korea's fashion hub and popular tourist destination, Dongdaemun, featuring a walkable park on its roofs, large global exhibition spaces, futuristic retail stores and restored parts of the Seoul fortress.\nThe DDP has been one of the main reasons for Seoul's designation as World Design Capital in 2010. Construction started in 2009 and it was officially inaugurated on March 21, 2014. It is physically connected to Seoul Subway via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station on Line 2, 4 and 5.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) was designed by British Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, winner of the 2004 Pritzker Prize, with the concept of \"Metonymic Landscape.\" Metonymy refers to a method of describing a specific object indirectly and, Hadid integrated historical, cultural, urban, social, and economic aspects of Seoul deduced from this method in order to create a scene of the landscape. Designed as a cultural hub in the historical district of Seoul as well as Korea's largest fashion district, the DDP is composed of undulating surfaces that resemble the flow of liquid and allow flexibility in space. The state-of-the-art BIM  (Building Information Modeling), mega-truss (extra-large roof truss) system, and space frame system are the key features in terms of creating grand-scale spaces. According to Hadid, the fundamental features of her design were \"transparency, porousness, and durability.\" Many ecological features, double-skin facade, solar panels, and recycling water system are included in the building.\nThe construction project for replacing Dongdaemun Stadium with a public park had been discussed since 2000 in the media, and the city of Seoul established a basic master plan for alternating the function of Dongdaemun Stadium in 2005. Upon the advice of architects, and in order to secure a high-quality design for the new landmark of Seoul, the city invited architects in February 2007 to participate in a design competition. As the guidelines, the city requested the architects to include a design plaza, underground spaces, history, and culture park for the project. Zaha Hadid's Metonymic Landscape won the competition.The exterior envelope of the DDP, a smooth and giant mushroom-like structure floating above ground level, is made of concrete, aluminum, steel, and stone. The interior of the building is finished with plaster reinforced with synthetic fiber, acoustic tiles, acrylic resin, and stainless steel and polished stone in the interior.\n\n\n== Main Programs ==\nThe DDP has 3 underground levels and 4 above-ground levels, and the main building is 280 meters long. The building is equipped with diverse public spaces including exhibition hall, conference hall, design museum, the design lab, the academy hall, media center, seminar room, Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, the designer's lounge, and the design market. Diversity of spaces allows the DDP to provide the widest range of events spaces possible to help to bring fresh vigor and cultural vitality in the city.\nThe art hall works as a launching platform for the Korean creative and cultural industry and operates as a key space for conventions, trade shows, exhibitions, fashion shows, concerts, and performances. The museum hall consists of five sections and allows many artists to engage in the design industry and exchange their ideas. The design playground, Design Dulle-gil (trail), the design museum, the design exhibition hall, and the design rest area are located inside the museum hall.\nThe design lab operates as an incubator for budding product designers from the inside and outside of the country. The design market is a multipurpose space for cultural event and shopping, and it opens 24 hours a day to provide a public space for visitors and residents of Dongdaemun Market, the town that never sleeps.In addition, the DDP has parking areas, dispensaries, a feeding room, a coatroom, a cafe, and other facilities and they are operated and managed by the Seoul Design Foundation of the city of Seoul.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDongdaemun Stadium was the first modern stadium in Korea and was built during the Japanese Colonial Period to celebrate the wedding of the Japanese Prince. From 1925 until its demolition in 2007, various national sports and celebration events had been held. The stadium was abandoned after the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and had become a local market in front of the largest fashion hub in South Korea.\n\n\n=== Demolition of Fortress Wall in the Dongdaemun District ===\nAround the district of Dongdaemun, Dongdaemun-gu, a fortress wall once existed to protect Hanyang (the capital of Chosun). However, the wall was damaged and destroyed from war and the rapid development and expansion of the city. The first demolition was conducted in 1889 for the construction of the trolley railway between two areas of Seoul, Seodaemun, and Cheongnyangni. The wall in the vicinity of Dongdaemun was demolished in 1908 during the visit of the Japanese prince, and a wall connecting Dongdaemun and Gwnaghwamun was destroyed to build Gyeongseong Sports Complex in order to celebrate the marriage of the Japanese prince during the Japanese Emperor Hirohito's reign in 1924. The construction of residential housing for citizens further destroyed the remaining walls, and a number of illegal construction after the Korean War accelerated the demolition process.\n\n\n=== Hullyeondogam and Gyeongseong Sports Complex ===\nThe construction of Gyeongseong Sports Complex in 1925, later known as Dongdaemun Stadium, resulted in further demolition of the wall and the buildings near the area. The first modern stadium was renamed the Seoul Sports Complex after Korea became independent, and the stadium became an important venue for various national events.  The complex was once more renamed the Dongdaemun Sports Complex, and its use decreased when the Jamsil Sports Complex was built in 1984 for the Seoul Olympics.\n\n\n=== Formation and development of Dongdaemun commercial area ===\nThe Dongdaemun commercial area developed in the latter part of the Chosun Dynasty when people started to create an autonomous market place around Baeogae. Another large-scale modern market, Gwangjang Market, was formed, and the district became a constellation of various markets and small businesses. In 1960s, a large number of sewing factories were built near Pyenghwa Market, Dongdaemun-gu, and the market soon became the largest shopping district for shopping. With the addition of Miliore, shopping mall for fashion constructed in 1998, the area has become a new retail sphere where citizens and other visitors buy the latest fashions at a reasonable price.\n\n\n== Dongdaemun History & Culture Park ==\nDongdaemun History & Culture Park is located on the east side of the DDP. The park connects the round-shape Downtown Green Field Corridor from Mt. Naksan to Mt. Namsan, and serves as a cultural space for exhibiting historic and cultural assets of Seoul. Originally, Hadid designed this area as a design street that introduces the latest design trends, but, during the excavation and demolition process of Dongdaemun Stadium started in December 2007, various historical remains were found. The city of Seoul established an excavation and investigation team for a safe and detailed survey in the area. In June 2009, the city decided to preserve and exhibit the excavated remains and announced the construction of Dongdaemun History & Culture Park that would work as a venue for the exhibition of historical remains. The area of the park is 65,232\u33a1, and the fortress wall of Seoul and Igansumun, two outdoor exhibition spaces, Yigansumun Exhibition Hall, Dongdaemun History Museum 1396, Dongdaemun Stadium Memorial, and Gallery MUN are the key features and facilities in the park area.\nThe local fashion hub district and the residential area share the park at the center, which was previously separated by Jangchungdanro-ro. In addition, because of the improvement in pedestrian walking environment after the construction of underground walking network, the park and building serves as a new cultural space that connects many parts of the downtown area of Seoul.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nChung, H.

          "If you are walking around the Dongdaemun area in Seoul City and all of a sudden you notice a piece of architecture that looks like a spaceship. Don't worry Seoul City is not about to suffer an alien invasion, don't you dare to run, what you actually have to do is to go inside",
          "During my short trip to Seoul, I tried to walk around the city as much as I could and found that stumbling upon the DDP around night was one of the highlights of my time there. It's absolutely stunning, there's ample space to just sit and relax, chat with friends, or take in the",
          "Omg, this place you can shop and shop till you drop.... many many kinds of fashion outlets and all the newest fashion are found here...",
          "a new place to hangout, and very stylish even at night. People are very relaxed and there's night markets every Friday and Saturday. Though not many foods for selection, you won't regret visiting.",
          "We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza late in the afternoon after a day of sightseeing as I was interested in seeing the Zaha-Hadid designed building in real life. The building itself is breathtakingly beautiful and equally impressive in my opinion and worth the trip alone.",
          "If I say this the same as mangga dua jakarta indonesia. Goods there tend to be expensive. If not join the tour then this place can be missed. But if you join a tour then try touring around the building, you will find Korean street food",
          "Very impressive architecture. Saw the led roses lit up at night. Beautiful. There were stalls selling handmade accessories and essential oils. There were also carts selling food and drinks at night. Prices are quite high tho.",
          "The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking. There are a bunch of shops inside, The second time I came here (in 2015 I think), there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing. It was no one I recognized and",
          "We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes. The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos. It is also a subway stop so it's handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood.",
          "Love how this place offer bazzars and some events. They have some good places to go. My favorite is kakao store^^",
          "enjoyed the design and if you go in the evening it is decorated with colorful light, found not much to do.",
          "This is a huge place full of interesting architectural designs. There are some shops indoors; another museum, cool eating/cafe area inside. Lots of great spots for pics. My daughter was there a couple of months ago during Fashion week & said you could see all kinds of ordinary",
          "As many are aware of, the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid. Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges. But, the inside is not impressive. There were just a few events and shops. It felt like a newly built office building. There are some things to have fun, though.",
          "Actually I didn't take many events there. When I was there, there were some special exhibition or shows, but I didn't have enough time, so I can't enjoy them. But I looked around design shops and design museum there, and it was great experience.",
          "There are so many amazing buildings in Seoul to see, mostly historical palaces, but there's something new and very impressive to see, Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) it is rather futuristic. The DDP is divided into a Design Hall, Art Hall, and Museum Hall, the whole complex is",
          "It\u2019s definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasn\u2019t worth paying 10,000 Won to visit the museum inside. There wasn\u2019t much in the museum and it featured some drawings, paintings, and hanboks. There was a gift shop in the museum.",
          "What a fantastic idea. So much creativity to see and on the day we went, there was an African food market. Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative. Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat (or cold) too.",
          "Visited the Van Cleef & Arpels exhibit. Worth the visit ! Very nice outdoor fashion show also. Nice music !",
          "This is the place where Seoul Fashion Week is conducted and it sits near the famous Dongdaemun Shopping Area. The building is contemporarily artsy and most people come here to take pictures on the photogenic spots.",
          "I went to the DPP for the first time a few years ago, checking out its architecture and the galleries inside. It's a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul, in particular if you are interested in architecture and design. Great photo ops both day and night. When I went this time",
          "Besides the beautiful architecture of the DDP (we have not visited the galleries), the highlight is the LED rose garden which looked so beautiful at night! A must visit when in Seoul!",
          "Very artistic and very big but very interesting. Lots of things happening inside, even if you didn\u2019t want to do anything it\u2019s just nice to be there and enjoy the scenery. Lots of shopping opportunities. Love Seoul.",
          "The only cool thing about this place is the design of the plaza and the rose led garden so go at night to see it lit up. Shopping is the same as everywhere else. I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better. I'm not a big souvenir shopper",
          "went to dongdaemun and pass by the DDP for a look around wonderful architecture but thats just it.. nothing special inside..",
          "The design of the complex is great, but that is all about it. Many empty stores and spaces. Better to be seen than visited.",
          "No doubt DDP is one of the most interesting sites to see in Seoul. Designed by famed Iranian architect Zaha Hadid, DDP is a fascinating contradiction to the squarish city that is Seoul. To really appreciate the marvel, visitors need to spend at least half a day walking and",
          "As great it is to walk around, you should really go in and check their design stores with some tasty coffee",
          "The name of the place speak for it. It's a very decent plaza to hangout for awhile, all specially created gifts, toys, travel item etc. One of the booth attract me it's the 3D printing, you take pictures surrounded by lotsa camera from 4 direction and the owner can print your",
          "Nice building and design. Walking distance to dongdaemun shopping district. There is a museum too. Visit if you enjoy design and arts.",
          "Wow. This place amazing and beautiful. It's also the venue conferences, fashion shows, trade shows,.... The museum hall is a harmonious blend of Korean design and globalization. I will be back here when I come back Korea.",
          "This is my first encounter with zaha hadid\u2019s architecture and can finally understand her talents. Every architect who is aspiring to be great should come here to study her work. Architectural documentation does no credit to her.",
          "Happy I've seen it, architecture alone is breathtaking. But nothing else. It's just a fancy mall. Come if you want to drop your kids to a playground, come for food trucks and coffee shops, come for cheap memorabilia shopping. You won't find here anything you may not find",
          "Beautiful building designed by Zaha Hadid. Even though nothing of interest went on inside or around the building for me, it is worth an hour just to look around the building.",
          "I was amazed by this building, seeing all the curves. I am an engineer so i appreciate from its exterior alone. I wonder how they have drawn this. There were nice buildings also within the vicinity so i guess visiting this place is worth it from the shopping plazas around",
          "Stunning architecture and well worth a look particularly in the evening. For those interested in reasonably priced Korean fashion, its proximity to the Nandaemun fashion malls is an extra plus",
          "Easily accessible by Dongdaemun History and Culture Metro station. Big and beautiful building, rather unique and artistic design. A great place to walk and take a stroll at in the evening if you are coming to Dongdaemun, lots of shopping and eateries opposite it.",
          "The design of the building is fabulous! At night it looks amazing. It shows Seoul\u00b4s modernity. I recommend to visit it.",
          "This place is a must to see, The architectuur can you campare with the modern part of Valencia, or the Gugenheim building in Bilbao. In the building you will be surprises buy the rolling lines of the wall\u2019s.",
          "This is a very artsy place where designers or architects would love it. Even so, do come and take a quick visit before heading over to Dongdaemun for your shopping. There are many exhibits which are quite interesting to see and you can chill at the rooftop grass field.",
          "The design plaza is interesting to visit, with many modern sculptures and exhibits. I went to the Aardman exhibit, displaying many canimated creations such as Shawn the Sheep and Walace and Gromit. They explain the many different aspects that make clay figures into a movie, the",
          "What I love It s the design The Main building is so stylish There is a nice garden around with lot of pleasant sitting area All around you ll find department store that open all night long Enjoy",
          "I only spent a while here because of time restriction, but if you wait until evening, the food truck will be open for business, and the surrounding will be lit. Inside, there are lots of exhibits and art market. On the top floor, they have a beautiful roof top garden and some",
          "It is amazing area for shopping especially at night there is beautiful designs of clothes with good prices",
          "A very artistic and modern plaza where local youngsters love to hang around. There are special labs for art students, seminar rooms, auditorium and a library. On certain days, there performance for budding young people to show cast their talents (singing, dancing) as well as",
          "The place itself it\u2019s amazing and the expositions inside are changing constantly and very interesting. We were there for the Fashion week and the location fitting amazingly with the event. One of my favorite places of the area. The surroundings have a lot of cool places to visit",
          "On first sight this Massive amazing architectural structure looks like a huge space ship. It is designed to host various events domestic and international, launches, fashion shows,,conventions, different performances .Museum is remarkable.Nice shops selling lots of local Korean",
          "It is a nice building, surrounded by malls and restaurants. Good for photo taking but the place itself has nothing much. Perhaps spend an hour or less there, take some photos and move to the shopping malls nearby or find a nice cafe to relax. There is a tour bus station (hop-on,",
          "I can't forget the view that welcomed me to this mall, so many LED roses bulbs all aglow! Good thing we went there at night. Plus weather right now is good, spring season, not too cold and not too hot. Plus, I was so ecstatic when I saw the area where my favorite Kpop group",
          "At first glance, the DDP looks like a set from a sci-fi movie (more like a giant space ship). The building has a very modern and futuristic design so it makes a very nice background for photos. Don't forget to go to the back for the LED roses which light up at night. There are",
          "Upon arriving at the DDP , as soon as I stepped inside I can instantly tell the design was by the famous Zaha Hadid. He buildings are huge and have very unique designs. It is definitely a place for those who love art and architecture or even photography as the building offers a",
          "Only stopped here because the building looked so cool from outside (my husband and I were on a bus tour). Didn't go inside, but walking around the building is cool enough; cool vibe and great people, lots of food stands around and great architecture, would highly recommend.",
          "The only unique experience here is the building features and the way the path is design. Building is quite big and there is a mini flea market going on the day I was visiting. Thus there are some local product on sales where they promote their products.",
          "The only nice thing I saw around this place is the colorful piano. The white roses looks dirty already and even their lights are getting dimmer. Hope they clean or fix them tho. They look better when brighter. You can spend a hour or two here and that's it unless there's an",
          "In awe of the architectural structure. it's designed by Late Starchitect Zaha Hadid. It's a must visit, mostly for the architecture. Their Archive cafe is also very nice, with really good breads and hot chocolate.",
          "Interesting art pieces around the plaza. Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times. Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area.",
          "This area is bustling and so lively at night. It is more of a wholesale market where people from all around the globe sell their stuff. The place has a array of shopping malls from luxury brands to locals ones selling souveniers. This is the place to buy local souveniers which",
          "This is exotic and nice building, for sure. Made several shots of it. But inside... I was expecting something unusual inside as well, however there's only food and shops. Sometimes exhibitions.",
          "In this plaza there is a exhibition hall, and fortunately I went there when Pixar had a big event on their 30th anniversary. I had a great time with my kids, watched all the history of Pixar and got more knowledge of how did they made animation movies such like Toy Story, UP, etc",
          "Impressive place in terms of design but lacks an information counter or signages in English. Good to walk around if you have no agenda.",
          "The Dongdaemun Design Plaza was amazing, i came here in the night and the lights make it more magical to see. Since the mall around here they open 24 hours so this area will be packed by tourist and local who shop.",
          "If you are ever in Seoul and want to enjoy modern architecture, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a MUST!",
          "This amazing building has to be seen to be appreciated. Go to the top floor and out to see the \"green roof\", walk up and down the stairs, explore the inside. There are many small shops selling design goods and souveniers, and cafes as well.",
          "Not really a big attraction, but it does have dining options and a interesting area for photos at night. The LED rose garden is worth seeing at night without it being too crowded. It is tucked away in the back of the building with stone walls surrounding making for",
          "Their operating hour is Tuesday-Sunday from 10AM to 7PM with extended hours of up to 9PM during Wednesdays and Fridays. This landmark is very accessible since it is connected to Seoul Subway through \u201cDongdaemun History & Culture Park Station\u201d. There are also a lot of shopping",
          "A beautifully constructed building, great place to go at night & take pictures. Coffee shops inside.",
          "I took lots of pictures here. It is so futuristic feel...huge and wide buildings. If you love stationery, there is a Monami concept stall where sells nice quality pens which i feel is a good souvenirs to friends or relatives. Not to mention it is a Korean brand.",
          "A must see in Seoul, especially at night. Very impressive architecture by late Zaha Hadid, she was an Iraqi-British architect. Looks like an U.F.O. has landed. Has a lot of interesting design shops inside",

          "I can say we were lucky because in our everyday itinerary we need to pass by in Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The modern, amazing architecture is simply picture perfect. We had the opportunity to view this beautiful architectural work both day and night. This is near Dongdaemun",

          "A must see when in Seoul. For photographers of all levels, this massive and unique design looks spectacular at night. During the day, it is a wonderful place to find younger locals who are always willing to practice their English with you....and of course a selfie or two!",
          "There are many little shops in this Plaza, but the most interesting is the building itself. Inside and out is it a marvel.",

          "We went here on Sunday night to enjoy LED Rose Garden. We came from exit 1 of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park station. The building was so awesome. There was a skating rink there. Besides of rose garden, there was some exhibitions inside the building. Some of the",
          "The place looks surreal but I enjoyed visiting it especially since we went there at night. The building is a sight to see definitely but nothing much to do there. There is some shopping inside but the malls across the street from the DDP are more interesting. We looked for the",
          "Shop till you drop or take a walk with art it its futuristic form. Even when it is closed it will still make you awe with their thousands and thousands LED ROSES at the back and the night spot lights emphasize the sexy contour of the building!",
          "This is a cool spot in downtown Seoul. I enjoyed walking around and through the rather large plaza and building designed by a probably pretentious architect with an idea of modernism. Still, there are plenty of shopping options and overpriced cafes :)",

          "The exterior of the building is absolutely striking and the interior is just as fascinating. The current exhibition looks neat but it seemed a bit pricey and small. It is an interesting place to visit if you like taking pictures and it's a place that you are going to like it or",
          "eye openers for new idea and design. great place to visit if have time from major sight seeing places in Seoul",
          "Soooooo boring. Don't know. Some people like the building but inside nothing interesting. Only few expencive shops. Was glad to see a good shopping center nearby, so it made the way there not so useless :)",
          "Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit. There weren't many exhibitions going on when we were there though so the design shop was actually the most interesting thing inside with so much cute anime or kpop inspired things or design pieces.",
          "This huge unusual building has no corners or straight walls. Walk around it and enjoy the interesting surface of the building. You will also pass the old city wall. If you are smart you take an elevator of a the highest highrise building next to the DDP. Once you have reacherd",
          "We came to see the rose led installation but since it wasn't dark yet, they weren't lit. The building is pretty cool architecturally and we enjoyed walking around the complex. There was a lot of walking space free from vehicular traffic. Also, we walked inside a couple of the",
          "If you love beautifully designed contemporary buildings, then it's worth checking out DDP. We visited while there was a fashion show and there was a lot going on, but there's also some shops and some art museums and stuff. I believe there's kpop groups performing here from time",

          "This place should be best to visit at night when the lights come on. An impressive building by day, the structure and its surrounds really comes alive when the sun sets, and the various angles get enhanced by the external lights.",
          "Although there are still some minor works going on in the interior and exterior, this is an extremely avantgardistic and impressive project - at the site of a former stadium. Don\u2019t miss the self-guided audio tour (4000 Won) with good background information on 16 stops outside",

          "It is a very popular place, but it is more saying that it rally is. Has some cool places but not enough for a big place. I\u2019ll doble think if I go there again.",
          "As a student of architecture, and I especially liked the unique architecture of this work. It was created by Zaha Hadid, a great architect !! I really admire! Architectural exterior as well as inner space is extremely great! Inside the building is a shopping area with art shop",
          "I went to this exhibit, which is mainly housed at the DDP and was wowed. First, the architecture of the building itself is really very unique, with its undulating curves and color. Very futuristic and stylish. Then the main attraction was the exhibit, which was incredible.",
          "The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise it's just shops on the inside. My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul, but I reckon you could safely miss this one.",

          "This is an attention grabbing building with little utility. There is little going on inside... Some shops selling modern design wares, venders, cafe.. Nothing substantial. The Dongdarmun Market bldgs are still there with its shops crammed with products.",
          "t must go there. A magnificient design. Like a museum but it's more than that. Should visit on Saturday's night. They have a garden of neon roses. So great.",
          "The museum building is amazing (5 stars) and worth seeing by itself which is almost the case. Is the museum a work-in-progress or has funding been reduced? There was a room full of chair showing design changes since 1932, an innovative play area for small children and that's",
          "While the building on the outside was pretty cool, there was little happening with the actually space. There was no reason to even go inside it - a quick walk around on the outside is all it's worth.",
          "If you do not know where to spend your night in Seoul, this place is not bad. It is windy at night. There was a public piano put at the street, anyone can play. My girl who likes to show off enjoyed it so much ^_^",
          "We came here to have a stroll at night and this place was simply beautiful. There were loads of food trucks if you want to have some street food. The LED roses also made the place even more beautiful. Good for a night stroll and some picture taking at night.",
          "it's an architectural master piece in my eyes. Never seen something like this anywhere. I love the night market and truck food. LED rose lights at night makes it charming enough. Head to 'Dongdaemun history and cultural park' station for direct access. 'Dongdaemun' station",
          "The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure. You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls, although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them. Everytime I visit the place (about every couple of months) there are no events. The design plaza is",
          "You don't see this type of building in your day to day life. A moden marvel of architecture. A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy. (my kids were not interested though)",
          "this place is very big and so many tourist. its not even a problem here. maybe because its near to shopping mall and food truck outside. we bought some souvenir at the road down there. and the street food look really tempting. yall really should try that.",
          "What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdrama's . I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP. Boy the choices was good... looking the portion of some of the",
          "Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place, with its countless street markets and architectural design, but it's nothing really more than a few photo ops, here or there. I do visit Dongdaemun frequently, to clear the head after a heavy night out, but there really isn't anything",
          "If you are into Architecture, you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I went here with great expectations and totally amazed with the building - although I am not a fans of zaha hadid style of Architecture. The building itself is breathtaking, because of its enormous size, and",
          "We went there for the night market. We were attracted by the Kakao Friends shop, and spent some time there taking photo. The Night market opened at 6.30pm and it is outdoor. The tables are limited, but there are plenty of bench we can sit. There were music performers who",
          "The architecture is simply amazing and mind blowing! There's a lot of space to sit around for a picnic so I suggest getting some beer and chips from a convenience stall and sitting down on the many small alfresco dining areas or the grass hill!",
          "Near the fashion areas and large shopping malls, this is a harmonious and curved architecture that can be seen from far",
          "I am in awe of this building! It has got to be one of the coolest Zaha Hadid buildings. Definitely worth checking out at night, when the electric rose gardens are lit and the building lights up with changing lights - it makes the whole complex look like this futuristic organism.",
          "I enjoyed walking the halls of the Design Plaza, but I was expecting more art and less commercial space. The exhibit space was nearly empty and very few staff were working in these areas. Most visitors were in the mall or restaurant area. Very cool building and a great place",
          "You would have a hard time finding a more splendid building. From the grassy roof to the curves that you want to touch, this is a one of a kind place. Walk about the grounds and just take it in. After that, well...there is not much. A art shop area was actually sort of a",
          "I love DDP. There's always something new and fresh to explore. I feel creativity coming from every angle and love wandering around looking at the buildings and sculptures. I love that there's a continuous change of exhibits and love the vibe of the whole area.",
          "happen to drop by... it is via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park subway line, which i cannot remember now. but it is nice to just wander around this area and visit the shops in the plaza.. there is also a tourist centre downstairs where u can sign up for tours, etc. or simply",
          "This place holds various exhibitions and fashion shows, so it really depends on personal preference. The last time I went was during its exhibition. Quite a nice view except that the pictures didn't turn out good on my phone. This is located at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park",
          "Come after dinner to see the lights and appreciate the architecture of the Design Plaza before heading to shopd which open all night. Accessible by a couple of metro stops",
          "Yea, if you're into architectures, yea this is a must go place for you. But if you're not into it, DDP might only be a strolling place for y'all. BUT, there's this LED flowers now, and it looked really nice! Of course, it's in Dongdaemun district so you can come here for a good",
          "The structure of DDP is worth the visit. There isn't much going on during the day but evenings are filled with street vendors that selling food, souvenirs, clothes, etc. The outside structure is very interesting with great architectural lines.",
          "The architecture of this place was amazing! It was beautiful inside and out. We went in the afternoon and missed the lighting of the LED roses at night, but even in the daytime, those flowers were impressive, especially the history behind them. There were nice shops inside",
          "Well worth going there to see beautiful modern architecture, museums and interesting shopping places with stuff from local and international designers. Nice open areas to hang around and chill out. There is also a public piano if you want to entertain yourself or other people.",
          "Impressed by the architectural design . simply out of this world with great accessibility to metro, buses. Its in the heart of Dongdaemun - the East gate shopping extravaganza!.",
          "Great piece of architecture and design, if your lucky there may be an interesting exhibition on as well (we got lucky with '30 years of pixar'), design shop is cool too. Def one to see if you are a fan of architecture",
          "Seoul is city of design. One of the most unusual design is Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I love it, inside and outside!",
          "Interesting building with exhibits. Lots of shopping nearby and there is a subway station at the plaza.",
          "Worth the Visit when you're in Korea. Been here for two times already and this place still amazed me.",
          "Best to visit in the evening with changing and throbbing lights and all! We did not bother entering as we were so tired from a day's tour, we just posed and took some selfies. Next time, we'll check the schedule of events.",
          "The DDP is good for photoshooting and you can easily get an instagram-worthy picture here.I went there at night and the DDP is just look like a UFO stations at Seoul city. The lights on the DDP blinks slowly at night. You can take a walk around DDP and enjoy the night view of",
          "There are museum/ Exhibition center/ in the building, you should check schedule before visiting! After I had shopping near around It's very convenient to take subway there! I love Seoul!!!! :)",
          "The building is it-self interesting to visit. Small museum shop, some shopping area. Good to take a coffee at the garden or at the terrace.",
          "DDP itself has nothing much but the exterior structure is amazing, and surrounded by lotsa malls which means endless shopping!",
          "This place is great to just wander around and explore. The architecture is magnificent and lots of good photo opportunities. There are also several picnic spots. You can also visit the museums and exhibitions inside for a price. Very good for dates or if you're tired of",
          "We went here with friends one night for a look see. The buildings themselves are really cool architecture and the rose light garden is great to see, but apart from that much of the buildings are still empty and the design part is not so obvious. There is a good atmosphere in",
          "Artistic modern design it was really open my eyes must go place in Seoul Then walk inside the culture park you will see the LED light roses field...main reason what's attract girls tourists to go there",
          "When I first see DDP, I think it may be a science park or something extraordinary inside, I think this DDP is invest by the Seoul goverment to showcase the products that create and design by Korean talents, well worth a visit if you have spare time..",
          "I was surprised to see this beautiful building.. And then I discovered that it was designed by Zaha Hadad the great engineer.. You can go around the build but I don't think there are much to see and to do inside",
          "This is my second visit here. This time not on purpose as I went to see the night market but at night the Design Plaza looks very cool! Probably best in the day if you want to have a bite to eat but at night visit it with other things in the area!",
          "The DDP facility is neat to see but when we visited in June 2017 there wasn't much to do there inside. The design museum was featuring a Korean calligraphy exhibition entirely in Korean so that was kind of a loss for us. It is worth walking around the grounds for 20 minutes",
          "Highly futuristic architectural design and awesome place. A must visit when in Seoul as it will leave a lasting memory for sure.",
          "I have never seen anything like it. From the outside it looks like a complex stadium or maybe even a spaceship. Inside the spectacular designs continue with elaborate archways and fancy lighting. There is so much to see and do here from shopping to eating. I have visited",
          "The architecture was very impressive! It's really an icon for art. They held art exhibition regularly too.",
          "Located in the Dongdaemun shopping district, you couldn't help but be awestruck by the jaw-dropping architecture of DDP. The gargantuan size of the building is simply too hard to miss as it totally dominates the Dongdaemun area. It is even visible from the Seoul city wall",
          "An amazing building to see and walk through and around, it is huge, curved and has a sci-fi look (we are sure there will be Sci-Fi movie made there one day). Just outside Dongdaemun station on Line 2, when you walk out of the station you encounter your first sight of this",
          "You cannot help being mesmerised by this stunning structure which dominates the area. You can marvel at the lines and its shear size. Make time to see this spectacle from the mind of the infamous Zaha Hadid. Can easily combine with a visit to Gwangjang market and a walk along",
          "Spectacular designed building celebrates small new designs inside. Travel up to 26th floor of the shopping plaza opposite to get a good view. See the precinct at night to see the LED white 'roses' at night and visit the museum at the back to see the history of the site.",
          "Lots and lots and lots of shops!!! Can be quite pricy for the local designers apparels, pay for their quality.",
          "There's nothing special about this place. If you pay extra for the special exhibition that you want to go, then maybe it's worth it. Other than that it's just the building. Nothing else.",
          "The DDP (Dream Design Play/Dongdaemun Design Plaza) is humongous in its entirety. It's also a great place for people who appreciate modern art and architecture, as the DDP holds about 4 floors worth of exhibition space for lectures, talks, and other brand launches (When we",
          "Impressive and unusual architecture which needs to be viewed by walking around and in it. Unfortunately we were unable to see the design exhibits due to lack of time, but just walking around the building as it snakes around a vast are of land was an experience by itself. Be sure",
          "DDP is very attractive building with beautiful lightnings at night. It's a nice place to walk around, don't miss the artificial rose garden.",
          "Modern architecture building with great landscape. Outside is better than inside as the shops inside are a little disappointing. Went to see the night LED roses landscape and totally worth it for the photo.",
          "the building is beautiful but not quite sure what's inside this magnificent building. but at least the exterior of the building and the historic park were amazing",
          "The place is vast and multi functional. The architecture is stunning but discrete at the same time. During Seoul fashion week it become the main spot",
          "While the building is impressive, the content inside is less so. I was disappointed in the design store as most of the Korean products have been removed compared to my visit a year ago. I could not identify a clear sense of vision as to what the DDP provided.",
          "The LED roses were really pretty at night, thats the only reason I went there.. haha.. and there is a Kakao friend store too!",
          "Nice building, stunning architecture. The building houses some small museums but I did not visit them. It's located in a very nice area with lot of shops, restaurants and foodstalls. Also there is a market of such which sells everything from phonecases to socks and pots & pans.",
          "We didn't plan well so ended up reaching here quite late and by that time we were tired as well. It's a nice place with lots of activities for kids . So if you want to spend sometime with kidd doing done design workshops this is the place to go.",
          "We found the area to be interesting and enjoyed the historical museum and the old wall. The actual exhibits in the building weren't of a much interest to us. The staircase in the main building is amazing",
          "We go there in the evening so we can enjoy food truck and taking the photo with flower lights. There many local vendor too.",
          "It's a nice place to sit down and take a break from the shopping. There is also a huge atrium inside where they sell many interesting household decorative stuffs. The prices are very reasonable.",
          "My opinion is that such buildings like this DDP (as well as other buidlings by Zaha Hadid architecture) need more space outside. You need to have a better vision of the general buidling to get more impression (take Baku, Azerbaijan for example). But here the buiding is stucked",
          "didn't see anything because you have to pay and not sure if it will be worth it to see do didn't end up seeing anything.",
          "As dongdaemun is famous for its shopping area. this plaza adds beauty to this place. this plaza is also a fashion hub there fashion shows are held regularly.",
          "Just seeing the building is impressive in itself. The shops inside are pretty generic, but just going to check out the architecture is worth it. What a great piece of art.",
          "Really glad I went to check out the famed architecture. It really is quite stunning. The Design Lab is also good. Expect high end prices on quirky goods. Lots of international representation, so dont expect everything to be Made in Korea, although there are enough local",
          "Thought there would be more to this place. There is a movie theatre and places to eat at the lower level, but not sure it was what we expected. Could have spent the time somewhere else.",
          "Very nice and unique building in Seoul. Near shopping center as well. We went to this building because of the strange shape, didnt really get into the building and explore",
          "I happened to visit this area during fashion week in March. So much fun seeing all of the people dressed up, wannabe models and photographers, various food trucks and so many people.",
          "We visited DDP on a tour. The place is pretty cool if you are into funky and unique goods and souvenirs to take back. For example they have a stall which can make 3D statues of yourself which are made of plastic using 70+ cameras. They also have goods by unique designers from",
          "Actual place is another 1km away. We ended up taking another taxi ride to the actual place. Google map would be a more actual representation.",
          "The plaza design is one of a kind and worthwhile to visit just to see. Especially good for a rainy day. The design shop was puzzling. We most enjoyed seeing the art exhibition on the Korean alphabet Hanguel, which had an entrance fee. Other temporary exhibitions at the time were",
          "Not being a fan of Museums, well I thought this was one of them, it surprised me, it had shops restaurants and everything in between. It even hosted food trucks! Amazing! Well worth the visit!",
          "If you're already at the area and have a few minutes to spare, then it won't hurt to go here. There are a lot of magnificent art and building designs to see which is great for picture taking. Aside from that, there are also various food carts which features authentic Korean",
          "Really nothing much. Most people visit because it is near Dongdaemum and the building design is unique. The shops within are just a waste of time, in my view.",
          "You can't missed this building if you shop around Dongdaemun. The building structure is very special and big. Take some time to explore the place. Better to visit in the evening as the lights are beautiful.",
          "It is worth of stepping out the metro for 10 min and taking a photo but not much more. Exhibits and shops inside are boring and only interesting place is the black hole like tunnel they showcase on photos.",
          "Happen to visit this area and still has some time. Decide to walk over to take a look of this Silver Dome. This is unique structure by itself in this tall buildings area. It is ready huge building and think is the same idea as The Arc in Daegue.",
          "DDP is close by to Dongdaemun market, didn't think we will spend much time here but once we were here it was really quite something. The Design Lab had many different stalls selling different artists unique crafts and gadgets. We easily spent over an hour in there. Worth",
          "Not only stunning from the outside, the inside offers a huge range of museums and designer shops where you can find design gems from great young and talented designers.",
          "I came here for the DDP night market. The night market closes quite early. My friends and i arrive there around 12 at night and almost shops are closed. We didnt eat anything there. Luckily we took some picture with the LED roses for 5 minutes. Lights turned of very soon. Most",
          "I have never seen so much shopping in my life. There were hundreds of stalls and stores in the area. You can buy wholesale and also by the peace. Anything you need for a home or to wear is found here. I purchased many items. A must see.",
          "I didn't get to go in but did enjoy this massive architecture from the outside. I went up a department store to the 10th floor, and got a bird's eye view of it, the building has a balcony. See photo.",
          "This is a beautiful building from all angles and when we visited there were some great stalls by local artists set up. The shopping nearby is also well worth a look. Plenty of restaurants nearby too.",
          "This is an up and coming tourist attraction mainly because of its initial appearance to a korean drama, My Love from Another Star. But the place is really a work of art that houses different art exhibits and other events. Go here at night to see the entertaining light display of",
          "First i saw this buliding, so exited. Its so unique like ufo building ^^ I recommend you to go here at night because its more beautiful with led rose garden. Light floor like tetris just wow to me can go here. Its really modern Building Near with doota and other fashion market",
          "It is not really a good place to shop...but a best place to see latest fashion if you love K-Pop. It is quite expensive ...but a good place to stroll around",
          "This incredible space was design by starchitect Zaha Hadid, the building hosts the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and exhibitions spaces occupying the landscape like a spaceship. The entire space comes to life at night surrounded by a field of LED flowers. The impresive building has",
          "I visited the plaza during winter where Fornasetti Practical Madness was featured as the artist. The lovely architecture of the plaza was even more celebrated with the fusion of Fornasetti's design pieces strategically positioned on every curve of the design plaza. Want to come",
          "Impressive design. Nearby park where you can also take some pictures. I was really impressed with the design of the building. Was not able to visit the shops though, will check them out next time.",
          "We liked to walk around this place. Lovely architecture. The design lab inside of one of the buildings was not what we expected, stores that sold some stuff. We thought that it will be some kind of architectural design exhibition.",
          "The DDP is worth a visit primarily to see this architectural masterpiece by Zaha Hadid, the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize. I didn't find the shops particularly interesting, but they're worth a quick visit.",
          "1) Main thing about this place is its cosmic architecture. Spend some time and try to rich all points and layers of this gorgeous building. 2) Two small museums and exhibition spaces. Museums have free admission. Admission for exibitions varies. 3) Lot of small shops in Design",
          "Went there on a Monday and found out it was closed. But decided to visit the design shop on the 2nd floor and found some nice unique boutiques. Hope to return in the future to check out more.",

          "Very unique architecture building! A landmark in Dongdaemun designed by the world renowned architect Zaha Hadid. It features over 40,000 aluminum panels on the exterior walls. There are exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop. Several",

          "In short they call it DDP, and it caught my eyes since we were crossing the street. Luckily this place was just within walking distance from our hotel. I prefer to stroll around DDP while my friends shopping at Dongdaemun Market and Doota Plaza. This is such an architectural",

          "I've never been in the museum side, but the design plaza is a unique little shopping area. I've bought some interesting things in here before, and it might be worth a look around, but I think if you are visiting Seoul that there are much more interesting and better places to go.",
          "This building is the face of the future. Very modern and very impressive architectural details. You find here also the location of the hit korean TV series \"My Love from the Star\".",

        "wiki": "Seoul (, like soul; Korean: \uc11c\uc6b8 [s\u028c.ul] (listen); lit.\u2009'Capital'), officially the Seoul Special City, is the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea. Seoul has a population of 9.7 million people, and forms the heart of the Seoul Capital Area with the surrounding Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province. Ranked as an alpha world city, Seoul was the world's 4th largest metropolitan economy with a GDP of US$635 billion in 2014 after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles. International visitors generally reach Seoul via AREX from the Incheon International Airport, notable for having been rated the best airport for nine consecutive years (2005\u20132013) by the Airports Council International. In 2015, it was rated Asia's most livable city with the second highest quality of life globally by Arcadis, with the GDP per capita (PPP) in Seoul being around $40,000. In 2017, the cost of living in Seoul was ranked 6th globally. In 2018, Seoul's real estate market was ranked 5th in the world for the price of apartments in the downtown center. Seoul was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which was co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. \nWith major technology hubs centered in Gangnam and Digital Media City, the Seoul Capital Area is home to the headquarters of 15 Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, LG, and Hyundai. Ranked seventh in the Global Power City Index and Global Financial Centres Index, the metropolis exerts a major influence in global affairs as one of the five leading hosts of global conferences. Seoul has hosted the 1986 Asian Games, 1988 Summer Olympics, 2002 FIFA World Cup, and more recently the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit.\nSeoul was the capital of various Korean states, including Baekje, Joseon, the Korean Empire, Goryeo (as a secondary capital), and presently South Korea. Strategically located along the Han River, Seoul's history stretches back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18 BC by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The city was later designated the capital of Korea under the Joseon dynasty. Seoul is surrounded by a mountainous and hilly landscape, with Bukhan Mountain located on the northern edge of the city. As with its long history, the Seoul Capital Area contains five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty. More recently, Seoul has been a major site of modern architectural construction \u2013 major modern landmarks include the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, Trade Tower, COEX, and the IFC Seoul. Seoul was named the 2010 World Design Capital. As the birthplace of K-pop and the Korean Wave, Seoul received over 10 million international visitors in 2014, making it the world's 9th most visited city and 4th largest earner in tourism.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (Korean: \uc704\ub840\uc131; Hanja: \u6170\u79ae\u57ce, during the Baekje era), Hanyang (\ud55c\uc591; \u6f22\u967d, during the Goryeo era), Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131; \u6f22\u57ce, during the Joseon era), Keij\u014d (\uacbd\uc131; \u4eac\u57ce, during the period of annexation to Japan).During Japan's annexation of Korea, Hanseong (\u6f22\u57ce) was renamed Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the hanja '\u6f22' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word Han (\ud55c) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".After World War II and Korea's liberation, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, Seorabeol (Korean: \uc11c\ub77c\ubc8c; Hanja: \u5f90\u7f85\u4f10), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla. Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name Geumseong (\u91d1\u57ce, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name Seorabeol had the same meaning as Geumseong.\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On January 18, 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic Hancheng (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u57ce; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u57ce; pinyin: H\u00e0nch\u00e9ng) to Shou'er (simplified Chinese: \u9996\u5c14; traditional Chinese: \u9996\u723e; pinyin: Sh\u01d2u'\u011br).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSettlement of the Han River area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.Seoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul. There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site. As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century, and from Goguryeo to Silla in the 6th century.In the 11th century Goryeo, which succeeded Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Southern Capital\". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement. When Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872. After Joseon changed her name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.\nOriginally, the city was entirely surrounded by a massive circular stone wall to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (Korean: \ubd81\uc545\uc0b0; Hanja: \u5317\u5cb3\u5c71), north of the downtown area), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun). During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry. In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.Much of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean\u2013U.S. owned enterprises. In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.\"After the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijo\" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.In 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.During the Korean War, Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces several times, leaving the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to Busan. One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5 million by 1955.Following the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities. From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.Until 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its de jure capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.According to 2012 census data, the population of the Seoul area makes up around 20% of the total population of South Korea, Seoul has become the economic, political and cultural hub of the country, with several Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, SK Holdings, Hyundai, POSCO and LG Group headquartered there.Seoul was the host city of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2 (233.69 sq mi), with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The Han River and its surrounding area played an important role in Korean history. The Three Kingdoms of Korea strove to take control of this land, where the river was used as a trade route to China (via the Yellow Sea). The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. Historically, the city was during the Joseon dynasty bounded by the Seoul Fortress Wall, which stretched between the four main mountains in central Seoul: Namsan, Naksan, Bukhansan and Inwangsan. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas. Due to its geography and to economic development policies, Seoul is a very polycentric city. The area that was the old capital in the Joseon dynasty, and mostly comprises Jongno District and Jung District, constitutes the historical and political center of the city. However, for example, the city's financial capital is widely considered to be in Yeouido, while its economic capital is Gangnam District.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSeoul has a humid subtropical climate influenced by the monsoons (K\u00f6ppen: Cwa). Being in the extreme east Asia, the climate can be described as humid continental with great variation of the precipitation throughout the year and warm to hot summer (Dwa, by 0 \u00b0C isoterm). The suburbs of Seoul are generally cooler than the center of Seoul because of the urban heat island effect. Summers are generally hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 32.6 and 23.4 \u00b0C (91 and 74 \u00b0F) with higher temperatures possible. Winters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 1.5 and \u22125.9 \u00b0C (34.7 and 21.4 \u00b0F) and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9 days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F), and on some occasions as low as \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) in the mid winter period of January and February. Temperatures below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) have been recorded.\n\n\n=== Air quality ===\n\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul. According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic metre (1.0\u00d710\u22125 gr/cu ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.Since the early 1960s, the Ministry of Environment has implemented a range of policies and air pollutant standards to improve and manage air quality for its people. The \"Special Act on the Improvement of Air Quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area\" was passed in December 2003. Its 1st Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2005\u20132014) focused on improving the concentrations of PM10 and nitrogen dioxide by reducing emissions. As a result, the annual average PM10 concentrations decreased from 70.0 \u03bcg/m3 in 2001 to 44.4 \u03bcg/m3 in 2011 and 46 \u03bcg/m3 in 2014. As of 2014, the annual average PM10 concentration was still at least twice than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines. The 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2015\u20132024) added PM2.5 and ozone to its list of managed pollutants.Asian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality. A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.Besides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Administrative districts ==\n\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu (Korean: \uad6c; Hanja: \u5340) (district). The gu vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km2 or 3.9 to 18.1 sq mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each gu is divided into \"dong\" (\ub3d9; \u6d1e) or neighbourhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighbourhoods. Gu of Seoul consist of 423 administrative dongs (\ud589\uc815\ub3d9) in total. Dong are also sub-divided into 13,787 tong (\ud1b5; \u7d71), which are further divided into 102,796 ban in total.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris. As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million, in 2012, it was 10.44 million.\n As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.As of 2016, the number of foreigners living in Seoul was 404,037, 22.9% of the total foreign population in South Korea. As of June 2011, 186,631 foreigners were Chinese citizens of Korean ancestry. This was an 8.84% increase from the end of 2010 and a 12.85% increase from June 2010. The next largest group was Chinese citizens who are not of Korean ethnicity; 29,901 of them resided in Seoul. The next highest group consisted of the 9,999 United States citizens who were not of Korean ancestry. The next highest group were Taiwanese citizens, at 8,717.The two major religions in Seoul are Christianity and Buddhism. Other religions include Muism (indigenous religion) and Confucianism. Seoul is home to one of the world's largest Christian congregations, Yoido Full Gospel Church, which has around 830,000 members.Seoul is home to the world's largest modern university founded by a Buddhist Order, Dongguk University. Native Seoulites tend to speak the Gyeonggi dialect of Korean.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003, and the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall in 2012. In 2008 the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9. The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nThe traditional, labour-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries; however, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries. Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka; top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery. It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n\n=== Finance ===\n\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai. Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island), which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s. The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office.

The 2nd World trade trade center is being planned at Seoul Olympic stadium complex as MICE HUB by Seoul city. Ex-Kepco head office building was purchased by Hyundai motor group with 9billion USD to build 115-storey Hyundai GBC & hotel complex until 2021. Now ex-kepco 25-storey building is under demolition.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nSeoul has been described as the world's \"most wired city\", ranked first in technology readiness by PwC's Cities of Opportunity report. Seoul has a very technologically advanced infrastructure.Seoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fibre-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s. Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places. Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month. In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, WiFi and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005. Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city, on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n=== Historical architecture ===\nSeoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site, Gangdong District, neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.Urban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul \u2013 Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Gyeonghuigung \u2013 all of which are located in Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project. The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, Unhyeongung is known for being the royal residence of Regent Daewongun, the father of Emperor Gojong at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.\nSeoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. Pungnap Toseong is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of Wiryeseong. Mongchon Toseong (Korean: \ubabd\ucd0c\ud1a0\uc131; Hanja: \u8499\u6751\u571f\u57ce) is another earthen wall built during the Baekje period that is now located inside the Olympic Park. The Fortress Wall of Seoul was built early in the Joseon dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about \u2154 of the wall remains, as well as six of the original eight gates. These gates include Sungnyemun and Heunginjimun, commonly known as Namdaemun (South Great Gate) and Dongdaemun (East Great Gate). Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013. Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, Namdaemun Market and Dongdaemun Market.\nThere are also many buildings constructed with international styles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Independence Gate was built in 1897 to inspire an independent spirit. Seoul Station was opened in 1900 as Gyeongseong Station.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern architecture ===\n\nVarious high-rise office buildings and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the Tower Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, and the Lotte World Tower, dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 4th highest building in the world.\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences.

        "wiki": "Cheonggyecheon (Hangul: \uccad\uacc4\ucc9c, Korean pronunciation: [t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\u028c\u014b.gje.t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\u028cn]) is a 10.9-kilometre-long (6.8 mi), modern public recreation space in downtown Seoul, South Korea. The massive urban renewal project is on the site of a stream that flowed before the rapid post-war economic development caused it to be covered by transportation infrastructure. The $900 million project initially attracted much public criticism but, since opening in 2005, has become popular among residents and tourists.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCheonggyecheon is an 8.4 km (5.2 mi) creek flowing west to east through downtown Seoul, and then meeting Jungnangcheon, which connects to the Han River and empties into the Yellow Sea. During the presidency of Park Chung-hee, Cheonggyecheon was covered with concrete for roads. In 1968, an elevated highway was built over it.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe stream was named Gaecheon (\"open stream\") after the first refurbishment project to construct a drainage system during the Joseon Dynasty. The work, which included dredging and bolstering the banks of the stream and building the bridges, was carried out every 2-3 years during this period from the reign of Taejong, the third king of the Joseon Dynasty. King Yeonjo especially undertook the refurbishment work as a national project.Gacheon was renamed to Cheonggyecheon, its current name, during the Korea under Japanese rule. During this time, financial difficulties disrupted and prevented the Imperial Japanese forces from covering up the stream despite several attempts to do so.After the Korean War (1950\u20131953), more people migrated into Seoul to make their living and settled down along the stream in shabby makeshift houses. The accompanying trash, sand, and waste, and deteriorating conditions resulted in an eyesore for the city. The stream was covered up with concrete over 20 years starting in 1958, and a 5.6 km-long (3.5 mi), 16 m-wide (52 ft) elevated highway was completed in 1976. The area became an example of successful industrialization and modernization of South Korea.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nIn July 2003, then-Seoul mayor, Lee Myung-bak initiated a project to remove the elevated highway and restore the stream. It was a major undertaking since the highway had to be removed and years of neglect and development had left the stream nearly dry. 120,000 tons of water were to be pumped in daily from the Han River, its tributaries, and groundwater from subway stations. There were safety problems due to the deteriorated concrete. Still, restoration of Cheonggyecheon was deemed important as it fit in with the movement to re-introduce nature to the city and to promote a more eco-friendly urban design. Other goals of the project were to restore the history and culture of the region, which had been lost for 30 years, and to revitalize Seoul's economy.\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government established several organizations to oversee the successful restoration of Cheonggyecheon: the Cheonggyecheon Restoration Project Headquarters for the control of the whole project; the Citizen's Committee for Cheonggyecheon Restoration Project for the management of conflict between the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the union of merchants; and the Cheonggyecheon Restoration Research Corps for the establishment and review of the restoration plan.\nTo address the consequent traffic problem, the Cheonggyecheon Restoration Project Headquarters established traffic flow measures in the downtown section affected by the restoration work and coordinated changes in the downtown traffic system based on the research of the Cheonggyecheon Restoration Research Corps.The restoration of two historic bridges, Gwangtonggyo and Supyogyo, was also a contentious issue, as several interest groups voiced opinions on how to restore historical and cultural sites and remains and whether to replace the bridges or not.The Cheonggyecheon restoration project had the purpose of preserving the unique identity of the natural environment and the historic resources in the CBD of Seoul, and to reinforce the surrounding business area with information technology, international affairs and digital industries. The plan encouraged the return of the pedestrian-friendly road network connecting the stream with traditional resources: Bukchon, Daehangno, Jungdong, Namchon, and Donhwamungil. This network system, named the CCB (Cheonggyecheon Culture Belt), tried to build the cultural and environmental basis of the city.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nThe stream was opened to the public in September 2005 and was lauded as a major success in urban renewal and beautification. However, there was considerable opposition from the previous mayoral administration of Goh Kun, which feared gentrification of the adjacent areas that housed many shops and small businesses in the machine trades.\nCreating an environment with clean water and natural habitats was the most significant achievement of the project. Species of fish, birds, and insects have increased significantly as a result of the stream excavation. The stream helps to cool down the temperature on the nearby areas by 3.6 \u00b0C on average versus other parts of Seoul. The number of vehicles entering downtown Seoul has decreased by 2.3%, with an increasing number of users of buses (by 1.4%) and subways (by 4.3%: a daily average of 430,000 people) as a result of the demolition of the two heavily used roads. This has a positive influence by improving the atmospheric environment in the region.\nThe project attempted to promote the urban economy through amplifying urban infrastructure for a competitive city in the business and industrial area centered on the stream. The urban renewal project was the catalyst of revitalization in downtown Seoul. Cheonggyecheon became a centre for cultural and economic activities.\nCheonggyecheon restoration work brought balance to the areas south and north of the stream. During the modernization era, downtown Seoul was divided into two parts, north-south, based on their features and function. The restoration helped to join these parts to create a new urban structure connecting the cultural and environmental resources in northern and southern areas of the stream (Hwang n.d.), resulting in a balanced and sustainable development of northern and southern areas of the Han River.\nThe project sped up traffic around the city when the motorway was removed. It has been cited as a real-life example of Braess' paradox.\n\n\n== Cost ==\nBudgeted at 349 billion won, the final cost of the project was over 386 billion won (approximately US$281 million).Some Korean environmental organizations have criticized its high costs and lack of  ecological and historical authenticity, calling it purely symbolic and not truly beneficial to the city's eco-environment. Instead of using the restoration as an instrument of urban development the environmental organizations have called for a gradual long-term ecological and historical recovery of the entire Cheonggyecheon stream basin and its ecological system.The cost of managing Cheonggyecheon has been rising every year.\n\n\n== Photos ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRivers of Korea\nDaylighting, the process of revealing rivers which have previously been covered over as part of urban development\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nM.-R.

          "in the midst of tall buildings, and city noise, this is a true peaceful oasis, with ti s cute colorful umbrellas and art display installations,and peaceful water sounds. very sweet and beautiful spot.",
          "We stayed in the Myeongdong shopping area, and walking to the stream was only 5-mins away... north of the Line 2 (green) subway station. We went there at night after dinner, and it was very tranquil. There were sections along the stream where you can cross over to the other",
          "Felt very safe here walking at night. It's a nice date activity. The lights are pretty, and it's a comfortable walk.",
          "During Christmas time (and New Year time), this area was changed as a new city/world within the city. It's was like enjoying a special moment/time within the real time. Time stopped for a while, the time for appreciating all surrounding and glancing things. Really nice and still",
          "Went at evening to see the lanterns on the stream. It was breath taking.We took many photos and marvelled at the beauty of the lanterns. It is a lovely walk also in the day time. Great to stop along the walk and find a place for food.",
          "We took a quick stroll with the kids before sunset, when it gets cold. The lanterns were not lit up but it was a refreshing quick stroll. I bet it's even lovelier during summer. One of the more relaxing area in this busy city.",
          "Clean and well main-maintained stream in the bustling city. A lovely and beautiful place to relax and unwind.",
          "We visited in the evening of Christmas Day. There is a lot of people as expected. The stream is being decorated with beautiful lights. People are taking photos along the way and above at street level. Unfortunately some rude Korean speaking ladies ruined the evening as they",
          "Second time visiting, but first time with my teen so wanted to show her, it was interesting to walk in this stream but we went there at about 6pm and it was pret dark and there was no activity nor christmas nor year end lighting so we didnt stay long and left.",
          "Really great place, superbly lit for Xmas. Very popular and thus quite busy. You can walk a good 5km or so and there are a numbee of displays along the way.",
          "I like to come here at night as it is always lit up with pretty lanterns and with the water gently flowing it provides a nice distraction and break from the hustle and bustle of the city. On the roads either side there are a number of coffee shops, restaurants and other points",
          "I walked almost the complete length and back of the stream. It was winter and during the morning hours so there were few people, no night lighting or street food stalls and alas the plants were not looking their best in the cold. It\u2019s a nice walk, but nothing exceptional. Maybe",
          "It was a nice stroll after food at Kwangjang market, walk all the way to dongdaemun. The kids enjoyed the stroll.",
          "It was having christmas theme, so the stream is decorated accordingly. A good stroll to take after having lunch.",
          "A very beautiful place to visit for mind refreshments. Nice place to hang out at the evening. Superb place for photo shoot.",
          "Just another stream to me. Maybe i did not spend enough time there. Ok to have a look but nothing to wow about in my opinion.",
          "I was lucky enough to walk half length of the stream walk of about 16 points/6km. The waterfall at the start of the adventure led to multiple stepping stone crossings from side to side, abundant fish and bird life as well as beautiful trees. Bridge architecture varies at each",
          "It's a cute and artistic way of making an inevitable water course into a nice attraction. Maybe not so much in winter when I was there but probably a nice cooling respite from the high-rise buildings all over Myeongdong especially in summer. I used it as a marker to guide me",
          "I understand this stream is a recent transformation and what a great idea it was. As it is below street level, the noise and din of the great city is greatly diminished and while walking a portion we saw a heron fishing, catching, and eating a meal of fish. Way cool. Very few",
          "pretty average attraction with a proper sidewalk at both banks of the stream for visitors to stroll along",
          "Do find some time to stroll the length of this cool stream that cuts the city. You will feel as though you have detached from the hustle and bustle of the city. Several subway stops will lead you here. Check it out if feel that the city is getting to be too much!",
          "Very often, after long air-travel, one needs an outdoors option for a fast walk, and this nice stream, well hidden from noise of traffic, is an ideal place.",
          "It was a great/beautiful walk down the stream i usually dont walk around but i appreciated this beautiful scene i embraced it and will do it again.",
          "Magificant light festival along the river, whenever you go to Seoul it\u2019s akways worth checking what\u2019s happening on the river. Lots of bars and restraints nearby",
          "Great river walk. Went after dinner and everything was lit up. Every block had different art pieces. My favorite was the lantern section. Got a bit overcrowded in some areas and not as many stairs back up as I would of thought",
          "I went to this place a few times in the past. At night the waterfall was lit up beautifully. On the weekends there were many hawker stalls selling food, etc. This year there was a lantern show and the place was unusually crowded.",
          "This was a very great use of space to add something natural but man made. It gives back to nature in a concrete world.",
          "Was brought by relatives to visit this beautiful place. Caught by great surprise with the amazing landscape along the stream. We happened to chance upon 2019 Seoul Lantern Festival in Nov. There were so many featured lanterns, each lantern has a story behind it which are very",
          "I thought we would use the stream a lot to get from A to B and avoid the busy streets and traffic but turned out it is just that bot too far south of the main areas to be that useful. Looks pretty though.",
          "We enjoyed walking along the paths by the stream, both in the day and at night. There are lots of interesting features (stepping stones, fountains, artworks, benches with sunshades, etc) that make it a lovely way to get between places or just stroll. It felt very safe at night,",
          "The stream is a good way to travel across the city, away from the heavy traffic and need to wait at pedestrian crossings. At places it is quite colourful and pretty at others it's a bit more neglected. It is a safe way to get around and features labels and access steps to the",
          "Located in the Centre of the metropolis, the walkway gives a sense of calmness from the fast paced city. No festivities while I was here but I\u2019m sure events would be well decorated.",
          "Such an interesting stream and atmosphere running through the city. Although the stream is in the heart of the city it is such a pleasant place to rest. You will see business people and tourist alike relaxing and enjoying the sounds and sights of nature...taking a break from",
          "Nice, cool, clear, and clean stream. Families would come with their children or dates. The place is very clean, well-maintained, a lot of small fish, to be enjoyed by all ages. There was a safety traffic event at the end by the waterfall / filter that we were able to join and",
          "We walked here early evening and it was great. A few people but quiet. Art displays in some sections and a laser show as well. Up top were stalls selling street food. Walked about 3km.",
          "Was totally blown away with this \"new\" attraction when i chanced upon it 5 years ago. Its still nice, but i suspect the landscaping & other exhibits seems to have suffered from maintenance budget constraints. I did manage to visit the Cheongyecheon museum. Great place to spend",
          "I walked a number of miles by the side of the stream and it really is a delight. As one is sunk below the road it's very quiet and allows one to take a breath and relax in a city that is constantly loud and moving. Even after dark I wandered here as there are groups sitting",
          "Nice place for an early evening walk. Set beneath street level, so on hot days it remains cool. Well laid out walking paths make it easy to navigate. If you staying in central Seoul worth taking a walk in the evening before or after diner.",
          "Great view for refreshing , weather is good, water is cold, there is a fish .Some street singer is playing some korean songs.",
          "Lightings and umbrella decorations are very unique about this place. You can scroll along the stream while enjoying the night view and try some street food stalls. Must visit place in Seoul.",
          "My recommendation is to devote a good few hours to walk through it from the starting point (The big blue & red shell statue. IDK the name, it was all in Korean \ud83d\ude05)",
          "It is a canal walkway below road level with running water in the middle. Pedestrians are evacuated when the water level upstream is too high and needs to be released into the canal thus flooding the canal and the pedestrian path on both sides of the canal. There are plenty of",
          "Took a walking tour along the Chonggyecheon Stream. A nice peaceful walk starting from Gwanghwamun and ended at Dondaemun. Near Dondaemun you can have some lunch at the traditional Gwangjang market. If you want to have some peace from the busy CBD, you can find it walking along",
          "This stream is a nice place to relax and take a walk in Seoul. Can sometimes get crowded on the weekends, but it's a nice natural space in the middle of the city.",
          "Nice way to get from point A to B without the noise or stress of street traffic. I applaud the city for the effort undertaken to make this a nice place to walk but the landscaping/brush is now getting out of control. The out-of-control plants are distracting.",
          "The stream is nice but may not worth the effort to go to visit it. If you happen to be near it, go there and you will find you can take some nice photo there. We went to the part of it which is near the Dongdaemen Design Plaza. Not a bad idea to go if you have the time.",
          "Must see! In middle of crazy shopping there is a great restored stream. Beautiful access and tranquil area. Worth stopping and seeing fish with a coffee!",
          "This stream in the middle of the city is just wonderful. With walking paths on both sides, and stepping stones to cross the water, it is perfect for a walk or run. We are staying at a hotel nearby, so we have taken several walks here, both during the day and in the evening.",
          "A stream right in the middle of the city , make the city so relaxing and beautiful, we spend about an hour just sitting by the river stream listening to the flow of water and taking photo",
          "This is a lovely part of town to get some atmosphere and have a short walk. Nice fountains and stepping stones along the way.",
          "A 10 km stream in the city of Soul offers relax for everybody - healing stress, cooling area, reading, nature lovers - simply enjoy it.",
          "In the middle of the city is the Chenggyecheon stream which is a river pathway that starts from the centre of Seoul and can take you beyond Dongdaemun Market and further east of the city. It is a pathway full of interesting natural and man-made features including many bridges,",
          "Great to final see this restoration in person. Great rewinding. Herons in the middle of a mega city!",
          "A fascinating place. I'm impressed by the effort and resources Seoul invests on city beautification, cultural and historic preservation projects. Who would have thought that this stream was once paved over and was a major road. Its actually really nice and I know it reaches all",
          "The stream walk was conveniently located near our hotel. We loved walking it, it truly helped with our jet-lag. The walk way is peaceful, there were people of all ages. Couples, lingering off to the side spending quality time together, walkers of all different levels. Cool",
          "Seoul created an oasis with their construction of this river walk.The section we visited was lovely and being enjoyed by many on a very warm day.",
          "We walked past Cheonggyecheon stream to get to Gwangjang market and it seemed to be quite unkempt. Heard from my Korean friends that during winter there are lighting decorations, guess it\u2019s the wrong season to visit.",
          "Great idea in the middle of a big city. A shallow stream where you can sit, soak your feet and socialize with friends and family.",
          "A must see place in Korea, it is located in the middle of tall buildings but it\u2019s amazing how they preserve the place. It is indeed so rich in culture. A huge place to visit. You need at least half a day to visit all the sites in the palace. When you wear the hanbok costume, the",
          "If you are searching for a place to chill in Seoul. this is the right place. Here you can relax, get your feet wet and enjoy the calm of this area. Have a walk through Seoul along the banks of this stream is a must-do activity. The stream is pretty long (about 11 km): we walk",
          "A narrow water stream, nice to walk next to it or chill for a bit. Its nice in the morning and night too.",
          "In the high rising buildings , you can find these kind of natures. Good to go and stay in downtown and walk by the river.",
          "Cheonggyecheon Stream runs through the heart of the old city of Seoul, running almost East-West between a bit past the East Gate (Dongdaemun) to the West Gate (Soedaemun)...Its western end starts just a short way from the Gyeongbok Palace, while it's eastern end is very near and",
          "This river is beautiful, at night and daytime. There are a lot of diffrent events around here which makes a visit more fun.",
          "Seoul does not have many green spaces in its center - so it is pleasant to descend from busy streets to the river promendade.",
          "It's a beautiful stream right in the middle of downtown Seoul. I've been there several times. Both day and night. During the day it's a great place to take a relaxing break while sightseeing in the downtown area. It's below street level which keeps down the street noise. You",
          "This stream was once clean or concrete however trees and shrubs have been allowed to grow with a noticeable change since I first came to Seoul in 2009. The stream has a walking path close to the stream with stairs coming down to stream level. I\u2019ve been here before during the",
          "The stream is a place where you can relax, especially on a warm day. Grab some drinks and food and then just chill. We were there on a Sunday when there were musicians and market stalls close by. The stream starts next to a very cool sculpture and rainbow coloured building - a",
          "The famous stream was next to our hotel and of course having seen it in so many korean drama, we had to take a look. It was just a stream and on a hot summer day, many tourists were seen soaking their feet in the water. Nothing much to do here.",
          "Go in the evening as we went in the afternoon in summer and it is too hot Would he a great place at night and cooler time",
          "Cheonggyecheon Stream is an excellent example of urban restoration. The stream was underground, but now all the covers have been removed and the stream uncovered. Riverside paths have been built and a riverside park established, alongside engineered meanders and stepping stones.",

          "The Cheonggyecheon Stream eventually finds its way to the Hahn River a major waterway that divides Seoul into north and south sectors. The stream is the back drop for many a festival. I've been there several times. The first time during the Christmas season and was there for a",

          "It was so funny but memorable finding this place. We were at a shrine and we somehow can't direct where this stream is. An old Korean Lady guided us to this stream. It was just a 10 minute walk all along. When I saw the clear water with some fishes in it, you could tell that",
          "This is a fascinating walk which allows you to see a very busy and built-up city through the eyes of the past and gives you time to reflect. A wonderful afternoon's walk which also makes sure you reach the 10000 steps needed per day and then some.",
          "Strolling along the stream in the evening was our favorite experience in Seoul! What a pleasant setting filled with people enjoying the city. It seems to go on for miles, so you can walk as long or as short as you would like. Until you take the steps down to the stream, you",

          "My Korean friends have told me that Cheonggyechon Strean is exclusively for couples, but is not the case, of course, you will see couples walking around and having a romantic moment but you can go check out the stream with friends and family too. The best thing is you can take",

          "Cheonggyecheon stream is an excellent experience. We dip our feet there and it was very relaxing. The water flow was pretty hard, so no one dared to cross the stream, even though it wasn't deep and was not a long way to cross. We threw some coin inside the well. My daughter",
          "Nice place and weather. Lots of people enjoying summer time. feeding the fish and cycling along the river. will come back again during autumn",
          "A quaint and quiet walkway in city center, especially near Eulgi-ro and Dongdaemun. My husband, daughter and I were relieved to stroll along this tiny stream after a hectic meal in the Gwangjang Market, where we ate the famous Bindaetuk and Kalguksu. Actually we bought some Yut,",
          "Great example of incorporating nature in the city buildings. Great place to chill out and relax. Many local soak their feet in the crystal clear river water to cool themselves. Crane was spotted in the river fishing for food. River is not deep probably just ankle or knee deep",
          "This is a 10 km long modern stream that runs through downtown Seoul. I walked a portion of the stream, from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun during a weekday afternoon. It was rather quiet, with a few locals sitting along the bank to relax and chill. I suppose it is livelier in",
          "I didn't know what was the big deal when everyone told me I have to visit the steam. It's a very long walk until the end of the stream - you don't have to walk all the way. The view is better in the evening. Apparently it used to be road. And the government decide to make it a",
          "Very nice to walk or have early morning jogging. Nicely and thoughtfully decorated. Highly recommend to have walk through.",

          "Loved taking a leisurely stroll along this urban creek. Its highly developed and right in the middle of the city, plenty of performers and couples dot the shore well into the evening. Though access down to the shore could be easier, as there are specific points you can use,",
          "When shopping in Myeongdong, take 5 minutes to walk down the stream for a mindfulness moment (and great photo ops). I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a must do when in Seoul but it is lovely.",
          "When Seoul is hot and the traffic and confusion on the streets is too much to bear, just find the steps (or occasional elevator) which lead to the cool, quiet Cheonggyecheon Stream. You can wander from City Hall all the way to Dongdaemun Square and along the way enjoy the",
          "Was walking around Dongdaemun at night and almost missed this place cos you will think it is just a simple canal. Get closer and it is more than that. I know the history of this place and that it was once very polluted and unsightly. Amazed at its renewal. Wish I could see this",
          "Started from the start and walked about 4 kms. The first few hundred meters are excellent, after that there was the prominent smell of sewer gas. Nevertheless, better than walking on the street.",
          "This is an amazing urban renewal project turning an otherwise unsightly drain into a beautiful stream and park. The water looked shallow and clean. Both sides of the pedestrian walkway were well paved and landscaped. We approached Cheonggyecheon after exiting Dongdaemun metro",

          "So a concrete overhead highway was removed and the stream below restored to create this urban oasis in the heart of a busy city. What a tranquil respite to go for a walk along this water. It runs for several miles going under bridges and there's some neat artwork along the way.",
          "The most beautiful spot in Seoul. Took the metro from Myeongdong to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, exited at Exit #1; walked past the futuristic Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) designed by Zaha Hadid; and crossed the street to the stream entrance. Immediately we were",
          "I was really looking forward to seeing this stream but when we got there was a bit disappointed. No art to be seen - just a few traffic cones! Glad we saw it though and still cool to have a stream in the middle of the city that is peaceful.",
          "Man made, below street level stream. After a long, hot day of walking, it was nice to dip our feet in the cold stream to cool off. It could be better maintained in terms of trash and weed removal. It was cool to see a heron stalk and pluck a small fish out of the water and eat",
          "Our family visited this stream and enjoyed the photo moments. We enjoyed our stroll along the stream. It was a short and easy stroll for us. A worthy experience for my family. This stream is walking distance from the Lotte Department Store. It is easily accessible by public",
          "It's pretty picturesque during the day then at night with the lighting it gives it another just as picturesque side. Cool to just wander along with plenty to look at along the way. Also worth joining the Spooky Side of Seoul tour which takes in part of the stream and gives some",
          "Love how they converted this stream into a nice park and place to rest and relax for the people and visitors to Seoul. I hope they maintain it as just a park and not be invaded by commerce. Its a much nicer stroll at night .",
          "It is indeed a place worth visiting. We strolled along the stream and stopped to sit at the side to enjoy the breezy wind and get some sunlight during the spring season. Don't forget to bring some titbits and a bottle of hot tea with you at your next visit.",
          "We came here on an evening and the scenery was quite beautiful. The wind was blowing it was a bit cold, but nevertheless we had a pleasant time relaxing at the stream enjoying the murals and the flow of water across the stream. The kids enjoyed this stream so much as well. Truly",

          "What a great illustration of the talent and commitment of the korean people. Turning an old piece of infrastructure into this amazing public space. Could not believe how clean it was and how big the fish we saw in there were ~ 1 to 2 feet",

          "My hotel, the VenueG, fronted onto this restored stream. It was a convenient riverwalk type park that ran right into the heart of Seoul and within sight if the main square and the Palace. There were fish in the stream and it was quite a little oasis of quiet in an otherwise",

          "Lovely having this very pretty space right in the city - it's cool and quiet down there - very relaxing !",
          "These days it is hard to imagine how this space was before the previous road was demolished. It was worthwhile overcoming the various objections raised to thwart this project that has now clearly much improved the urban environment",
          "Nice view for photo and nice place to visit. Good to learn about the historical and community environment. In the past, this area was a railway. But in the present, this is a nice park in the central of Seoul.",
          "We stayed a bus ride away from the stream so we appreciated the nature amongst the bustling city when we arrived. The Stream is set lower than the streets surrounding it which separates the area a little better and as we walked down on a Saturday morning we were able to take a",

          "When to the section near Centermark Hotel. Although the weather was very chilly, and the path a bit slippery, it was greater and relaxing just hearing the flow of water. Different Scenery in different sections of the stream.",
          "We walked from Gyeongbukgung palace and found ourselves resting by the stream. It was a soothing experience. We admired the fountain and had a look around the stalls set up near the shell statue called The Spring.",
          "We decided to walk from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun Market (about 20 minutes) and it was such a peaceful walk. It felt like we stepped out of the city into another place.",
          "Located in the center but not really clean stream. There is a bad smell from the water of this stream. Not worthy to visit",
          "We talked the stream just after lunchtime on a sunny day in April. It was lovely. Exciting and relaxing at the same time. Everyone - from families having a picnic to the ubiquitious office workers on their cell phones - was out enjoying this lovely location. I see from the",

          "Ever since I watched the Korean drama, this place has always been flagged out as one of the filming site. I am intrigued to see a place right in the city, with stream and rock, you just feel that that is the perfect getaway after a long day of hard work. See it in the daytime",

          "Understand that this is the original river which flows through the city. It was slabbed over by the previous city inhabitants and was uncovered in modern times. This is an open river which is set below the road level and can be accessed at various staircases along its length.",
          "We weren't sure which area exactly to walk by the stream. We were at DDP and decided to check out the Cheonggyecheon Stream. We walked down and crossed over the stone tiles. My kids were particularly happy and crossed over it many times. I was expecting more people to be hanging",
          "Walked along a short stretch of the stream one evening. Interesting and lovely place, mostly for couples to stroll and spend time together below the city streets. The entire stream is quite long so we just had a short visit on the side nearer to Myeongdong.",
          "The stream is a little green oases in the city which makes it pleasant to stroll along at night but unfortunately it also smells like sewer at certain places.",
          "I went there at night and it\u00b4s very interesting. It has different figures during the stream, some historic, some modern, artistic and so on. It is very long, so you can decide where you end it.",
          "It was a good walk along the water from JW till the Gwanghwamun Square to go to the palace. Instead of walking on the streets with the pollution and the walking light stops - prefer walking along the water. The end of the stream near the Gwanghwamun square is the highlight of",
          "I was here walking along the river years ago. At that time, it was very beautiful. At this time around, in year 2018, it was not well maintained. It does need refurbishment as there is still a potential.",

          "I went there on an afternoon before the spring lantern festival started. It is very peaceful, you can take off your shoes and go down to the water, or just stroll, sit down, and relax. And take good photos. There were a bazaar happened as well, but the bazaar started at 6, and I",

          "The stream is supposed to be very lovely with loads of greenery and flowers in spring. But the weather was rather freaky when I was there in early April and even the locals I chatted with said it was too cold at -1 and 0 on some days. The stream was a good way to get back to",
          "One way to get here is Subway line 5 - Exit 5 Gwanghwamun Station. Alternatively, if you have time, get off at City Hall Line 1 exit 1 and if you head down towards Sejong-daero you'll pass Deoksugung Doldam-gil (arguably, voted the best street in Seoul), and Deoksugung Palace.",
          "It's close to Fraser place central Seoul about 15 to 20 minutes walk basically it's a stream and on the sides you can walk or sit to chat or eat, I read that at night there are activities, but unfortunately I didn't have the time to check it at night",
          "Nice area to walk through. We went at sunset in the beginning of spring and it was pretty chilly when we went so we didn't stay for long. There are murals on the walls with plaques about the history of the area. There are also stepping stones across the stream, which is quite",
          "Little fountains. waterfalls, lots of places to sit but it's all concrete. If you are walking by the area, you would enjoy it for 10 minutes",
          "As can be seen in some K-dramas, this stream is famous for couples to sit around with some food and drinks in hand. If you are lucky, there will be lots of street food van selling along the road sides. I\u2019m not sure the frequency of the food stalls open and I guess it might be",
          "Had to visit this stream in our tour, but before that you will pass Kyobo, which I think the biggest bookstore I've seen in my entire existence yet. And after there you'd see this stream which is a very nice place, but yeah nothing much to do here.",
          "It was a very nice park, a good backdrop to the surrounding urban area, very clean and filled with people. It's a good place to take a walk or sit and people watch but not really much else. Restaurants and shops line the edges so that helps too if you want to take a nice walk",
          "When reaching Seoul, we've been told this place is a must seen. All i can say, its a nice place, but over hyped. Recommend going there but without a lot of expectations.",
          "This canal has undergone refurbishing and beautifying works from what it once was to a place where people gather for a stroll and to just unwind. It's very clean and there is no foul smell. During festival seasons, this place will be decorated accordingly and will be much more",
          "Maybe there isn't any festival going on, thus nothing special or no special lighting or whatsoever when I visited. Just a another canal that allows people to walk beside it and enjoy the serenity within a busy centralized city.",
          "If you want to walk through the city, without having to cross roads and deal with traffic then this is a perfect place to walk along. The stream and plants make it very pretty. It\u2019s quiet in the morning but it\u2019s a popular place for city workers to spend lunchtime, so gets much",
          "I was in Seoul in February (a side trip while visiting the Olympics). I walked by this stream a few times, but it did not appear to be anything special. Maybe it would be worth it if you needed to waste time and there was some sort of event happening (e.g. lantern festival), or",
          "The place was a bit boring when I went there at around 10am... Just the stream... Altho there were only a few people if you want to take good photos of the stream. It would be good to come here if there is any festival or if there are lights at night.",
          "A small canal about 10 km in the center of Seoul. The canal has been rotten in the past. Now it is the public park and it has waterfalls in the big city center between many tall buildings. It make us relax.",

          "When you have done a whole day of walking in the Dongdaemun area, this spot is idyllic for rest and people-watching. As with most of Seoul, this park is well-kept. There is ample room for people to sit and enjoy the scenery. We went here in different parts of the day and",
          "despite going at night and not being able to see the fish, my 3YO still loved it - especially crossing the stream using the stepping stones. loved the stony paths, trees and pockets of flowers along the stream which made me feel like walking in the country side. wonderful place",

          "Beautiful small stream in Downtown. The stream will more beautiful then usual one special event such as Christmas.",

          "After many activities of shopping and eating in Seoul, this river offers freshness and tranquility. You can just take a walk or run (if you want) along the river. It is FREE and refreshing! There is also a coin spot for you to make a wish in this river. Such a lovely place \ud83d\udc99",

          "Even though there aren't many attractions nearby, only fast food restaurants and the street with the statues of the most important people in Korean history (king Yi Do and general Yi Sun Shin), I highly recommend you to go see it. I was there at noon and I wasn't disappointed",
          "This is a very cool waterway that runs along the city with a pedestrian path and great photo opportunities. Was lucky enough to make it out on my last morning in Seoul to go for a run and came along this stream which was great and also had a few benches along the way.",
          "The City of Seoul did a exceptional work to beautify this stream. It utilizes the stream as relax area for the busy city dweller. The decoration changes often. My visit was during X'mas time. There are plenty of special features along the stream. One should visit this place",

          "We really enjoyed the lovely river walk. It was winter, so probably not as pretty as it must be in the summer, but the sound of running water was very relaxing. Great lit up at night, and loved the mural of the royal processional with the music and sound of the horses.",

          "We were lucky to visit when the Lantern Festival was on. My impression of what the Lanterns would be was a little off track, but it was really interesting and a pleasant and safe place to explore. It seems like they use it a lot showcase things such as the lantern festival,",

          "We found the place just average. There are some benches next to the stream and pretty much that's it.We went at night and the streets were well lit with nice Christmas decorations. If short of time, just skip this place.",

          "We went on Christmas Eve and it was so crowded! Despite the stream was beautifully lighted up, the crowd was too much to handle and hence we cut short our walk at the stream. If you wished to take some pictures without strangers in it, perhaps should come in the morning or not",

          "I've been to Seoul many times and usually went straight to Gangnam ignoring the other side of Seoul (except Myeongdong). But Cheonggyechon is a must-see. The view from the bridges is fascinating and the location is very convenient. You walk along the stream from Myeongdong area",
          "We went to visit the place since it was listed under the top 10 places to visit in Seoul. Honestly speaking there was nothing much to see...it was almost winter season so it was very cold to walk along the stream. The walking path was nicely decorated, not many people were there",
          "The river is very long, nice for walking and relaxing. Location is close with the road and can be visitted by many access along the river. The river can be enjoyed by visitor at all season, especially at night time while we can enjoying the light with full color here.",

          "A flowing stream below street level that has been developed in recent years. If you're walking east - west (or vice versa) it is a good quick, or just very relaxing way to get around (for example Insadong to Dongsaedum) and avoid the heavy traffic above. Plenty of access points",
          "Lovely to walk along this stream if you are near Insa-dong. During the day, the path is nice but at night, it's lit. Really pretty for the holidays!",
          "This stream existed a long time ago but had a highway built over during the country's rapid industrialization period after the Korean War. However, it was reopened in 2005 as part of the city's urban renewal. There are walkways on both sides of the stream but I'd advise you it",
          "Please observe that depending on what time of the year you go here it can be completly desolate. (just a walking path next to the stream in the city) You have to check out Seoul tourist website to see if there is an even going on here or not. Depending on the even it can be",

          "It\u2019s not really all that interesting to be honest. It\u2019s cool that people can walk the stream that flows through the middle of a city, but I would not go out of my way to see it.",
          "It just like usual stream.. but you can walk along the stream and see some statue and lantern.. It depends on what special event that was held there.. when i was there, there was lantern festival..",

          "This stream sits right in the middle of a busy business district with many tall commercial buildings & busy traffic. It is near Gwangjang market as well. However, because the stream is many feet down from road level, it is quite peaceful & is like a park. It is a long walk",

        "wiki": "Bongeunsa (Korean: \ubd09\uc740\uc0ac; Hanja: \u5949\u6069\u5bfa) is a Buddhist temple located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu in Seoul, South Korea. It was founded in 794 during the reign of King Wonseong by the monk Yeon-hoe (Korean: \uc5f0\ud76c), then the highest ranking monk of Silla, and originally named Gyeonseongsa (Korean: \uacac\uc131\uc0ac; Hanja: \u898b\u6027\u5bfa). It is located on the slope of Sudo Mountain, across the street from the COEX Mall.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Joseon Dynasty ===\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty, Buddhism in Korea was severely suppressed. However, The temple began to be known as Bongeunsa when it was reconstructed in 1498 under the patronage of Queen Jeonghyeon, a Joseon Queen.  The term Bongeunsa means the act of honoring the king, which here can be understood as taking the form of praying for king Seongjong's eternal life.With the support of Queen Munjeong, who revived Buddhism in Korea for a short time in the mid-16th century, it became the main temple of the Korean Seon (Zen) sect of Buddhism from 1551 through 1936. Monk Bo-wu was appointed head of the temple in 1548 by Queen Munjeong but was killed soon afterwards as the anti-Buddhist factions regained dominance in Korea towards the end of Queen Munjeong's rule. From 1552-1564 it was the center of the Buddhist National Exam.\n\n\n=== Korean Empire to Japanese Occupation ===\nBongeunsa was made one of the Korean Empire's 14 major temples in 1902.  During the Japanese occupation the temple became the headquarters of 80 smaller Buddhist temples around Seoul.  In 1922 and 1929, the head monk Cheong-ho saved over 700 people from drowning in the Han river, an act that inspired a monument of recognition.  After colonial rule Bongeunsa became subordinate to the Jogye Order, the largest Buddhist sect in Korea.\n\n\n=== Destruction and Reconstruction ===\nA fire in 1939 destroyed most of the buildings, and other parts of the temple were destroyed during the Korean War. Fortunately, one of the very few halls which escaped destruction during the Korean War continues to hold the woodblock carvings of the Flower Garland Sutra, completed in 1855 by monk Young-ki. The temple has undergone many repairs and renovations, and is now once again a large, thriving complex. The reconstruction efforts are ongoing even today.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe temple is a notable tourist destination, offering \"Temple Stay Program\" in which visitors can lead the life of a monk for a few hours.\nThe area on the main street from the Temple to Park Hyatt Hotel, has a large concentration of vegetarian and other upscale restaurants that serve Korean cuisine with a modern twist. The day of Sansa begins with dawn. The Buddha has a sense of respect for the Buddha and a sense of looking back on his performance. Buddhist pilgrimage is not simply a visit to Buddhist temples, but a way of experiencing and learning Buddhist traditions and cultures. Zen is a representative practice of Korean Buddhism, which is based on the controversial ideology and reveals the heart and soul. It is a program to experience various traditional cultures linked with the historical characteristics of temples. Bowwu is a rice bowl used by a Buddhist monk in a temple, meaning \"a rice bowl containing a proper amount of rice.\" The meal that the monks call to the Buddhist temple is called the Buddhist temple offering.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Buddhist temples in Seoul\nKorean Buddhism\nKorean architecture\nKorean Buddhist temples\nList of Korea-related topics\nJapanese occupation of Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBongeunsa (Official site)\nAsian Historical Architecture: Bongeunsa Temple",

        "wiki": "The Bukhansan National Park (Korean: \ubd81\ud55c\uc0b0\uad6d\ub9bd\uacf5\uc6d0, \u5317\u6f22\u5c71\u570b\u7acb\u516c\u5712) in Seoul and Gyeonggi covers an area of 79.92 km2 (30.86 sq mi) and was established on 2 April 1983. Bukhansan means \"mountains north of the Han River.\"\nThe park contains forested areas, temples and granite peaks. The three main peaks are Baekundae, 836.5 m (2,744 ft), Insubong, 810.5 m (2,659 ft) and Mangnyeongdae, 799.5 m (2,623 ft).  Due to its popularity with hikers and Seoul residents, some trails are closed on a rotation basis to protect the local environment.\nThe Bukhansanseong Fortress is located in the park, together with its 9.5 km (5.9 mi) long defensive wall.  A fortress was first built on this site in 132 AD to protect Seoul from foreign invasions, and it was expanded to its current size in 1711.  It was reconstructed after damage sustained in the Korean War. Despite its name, this mountain is in Seoul, South Korea, so this mountain should not be confused with North Korea (also referred to as \ubd81\ud55c, bukhan).\n\n\n== Name ==\nThere is a current movement to have the name of Bukhansan reverted. For many years up until now, the three main peaks of the park have collectively been called \"Bukhansan\"; however, the original collective name of these three peaks was Samgaksan, meaning \"three horned mountains\". The Gangbuk-gu District Office in Seoul is leading a petition to have the central government change the name back to the original. Civilians, religious leaders, other district offices, and groups, such as the Korean Mountaineering League, are assisting in the lobbying to have the name of the three original peaks reverted to Samgaksan.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Trails ===\nThere are many trails and the most known routes include Baegundae (Hangul: \ubc31\uc6b4\ub300), which is Bukhansan's highest peak at 837 meters, the fortress wall, and the Insu-bong (Hangul: \uc778\uc218\ubd09) which rises up to 810.5 meters. The 70 kilometer Dulle-gil Trail (Hangul: \ub458\ub808\uae38) connects forested paths along foothills and villages, 21 sections out of total.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Korea-related topics\nNational parks of South Korea\nTourism in South Korea\nCastles in Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe park's page on Korea National Park Service's website",

        "wiki": "Deoksugung, also known as Gyeongun-gung, Deoksugung Palace, or Deoksu Palace, is a walled compound of palaces in Seoul that was inhabited by members of Korea's royal family during the Joseon monarchy until the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910. It is one of the \"Five Grand Palaces\" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. The buildings are of varying styles, including some of natural cryptomeria wood), painted wood, and stucco. Some buildings were built of stone to replicate western palatial structures.\nIn addition to the traditional palace buildings, there are also forested gardens, a statue of King Sejong the Great and the National Museum of Art, which holds special exhibitions. The palace is located near City Hall Station.\nDeoksugung, like the other \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul, was intentionally heavily destroyed during the colonial period of Korea. Currently, only one third of the structures that were standing before the occupation remain.Deoksugung Palace is special among Korean palaces. It has a modern and a western style garden and fountain. The Changing of the Royal Guard, in front of Daehanmun (Gate), is a very popular event for many visitors. The royal guard was responsible for opening and closing the palace gate during the Joseon Dynasty. Outside of the palace is a picturesque road with a stone wall.\n\n\n== History ==\nDeoksugung was originally the residence of Prince Wolsan, the older brother of King Seongjong. This residence became a royal 'palace' during the Imjin war after all of the other palaces were burned in 1592 during the Imjin wars. King Seonjo was the first Joseon king to reside at the palace. King Gwanghaegun was crowned in this palace in 1608, and renamed it Gyeongun-gung (\uacbd\uc6b4\uad81, \u6176\u904b\u5bae) in 1611. After the official palace was moved to the rebuilt Changdeokgung in 1618, it was used as an auxiliary palace for 270 years and was renamed Seogung (West Palace).\nIn 1897, after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation, he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again. Expansion of the facility followed after his return. After Emperor Gojong abdicated the throne to Emperor Sunjong, he continued to live in this palace. The palace was then renamed Deoksugung, as a reference to a wish for longevity of Emperor Gojong. Emperor Gojong died in Hamnyeongjeon.\n\n\n== National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Deoksugung Branch ==\nLatin American Art: November 2008.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nDeoksugung entry is located 5-1 Geongdong-gil/Deoksugung-gil, Jung-gu.

          "Locating before City Hall, this place is easy to access comparing to other palaces of Seoul. With only 1,000 won, you can experience minor version of Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung. Good place to take a walk and have fun. Stone fence around the palace is also popular to",
          "A small palace compared to that of Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung. This palace is perfect for those who wanted to visit one but do not have much time. The palace allows visitors to understand the ancient Korean culture. There is a change of guard ceremony at fixed timings here.",
          "This is probably one of my most favorite Palace in Seoul, definitely in the top three. It seems like it lies in the center of Seoul the way it is positioned surrounded by modern architecture of Seoul, hotels, restaurants, the City Hall and other important buildings. It\u2019s so easy",
          "There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth. Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them. Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences. This palace also has a lot of dynamic",
          "I visited 2 palaces (Deoksugung & Gyeongbokgung) during my visit to Seoul last month. 'though Deoksugung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but Deoksugung is quite unique compare to Gyeongbokgung. You can find both Joseon Dynasty & Western influences in this palace, something that",
          "Why pay for tour guides when you can hop on and off the subway and visit so many places in Seoul? This is yet another great place to mark on your tour and enjoy your photos for years to come.",
          "A well maintained palace in the modern city. It is smaller than Gyeongbokgong and Changdeokgung. Beautiful scenery!",
          "I've been here a few times over the years and it never disappoints. I love the fact that it has a changing of the guard ceremony (3 times a day I think) and other stuff going on too. Once inside though it feels like a different world with a park like ambience plus a mixture",
          "This was the last of four Palaces that we visited while in Seoul and the guide was the best we had experienced. It was a smaller Palace in comparison to some of the others, but the information regarding buildings, customs and structures carries across them all. Unfortunately",
          "This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city. We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice. (You can watch the",
          "A smaller palace in the middle of town. Well worth a visit especially if you take the (free) guided tour (about 50 minutes). Time your visit to see the changing of the guard which is quite entertaining.",
          "Deoksugung is right at City Hall Station. I went there to see the City Wall, the external wall of Deoksugung. This time I went inside the palace, as there were lovely maple trees showing beautiful autumn colours. Happened to see also the show performed by the palace guards.",
          "Deoksugung is the only palace open at night and the way it is all lit up is both beautiful and atmospheric. There was a children's concert going on when we visited which we stopped to listen to.",

          "I really liked this palace. Not as well known as the others but deserves two visits. First, the afternoon changing of the guards is fun to watch and you can stand right next to the guards. Second, this palace stays open at night and makes for some great pictures with the lights",
          "What a beautiful palace to visit at night. We stayed 5 minutes walk from the palace and was reading about the palace being open during the evenings. Definitely highly recommend an evening visit. It had a romantic atmosphere and was lovely to visit as a couple. Entrance is",

          "The palace, directly across the street from the Seoul City Hall and easily accessible using Exit 2 from the metro City Hall stop, is worth a 2 to 3 hour visit -- especially if one is a senior (65+) for which it is free of charge. The well preserved buildings interesting, as is",
          "A high school student called Esther who is my volunteer guide made the trip perfect. She was able to explain about the different buildings, meaning of motifs and emblems, and story of the Princess. Weather is very good in June with sun and nice temperature. Just in time to catch",
          "We didn\u2019t go inside the palace but watched the lavish and dramatic changing of the guards at 3:30 (I think the other times are 12 and 2pm but check that if going). We get lucky enough to try on free Hanbok costumes to experience the change of the guards and pose with the guards",
          "We went to Deoksugung. We were very lucky to be escorted by a volunteer guide. He was 16 years old and spoke good English. He took us through the various buildings of the palace and gave us a detailed explanation of the uses of the buildings and the history. This place was not",

          "Dropped by here because it was on our way, and walked the grounds. A few beautiful nature corners and buildings are picture-worthy, as usual. Otherwise, not much to see here, but if it's on your way it's worth stopping by.",

          "This was our first \u2018self\u2019 tour of the Deoksugung Palace. Interestingly the entrance fee was waived for the next few days, we got lucky. We also witnessed a demonstration right outside the palace. Lots of Korean and US flags. The palace ground is quite bare and brownish, I",
          "We went Deoksugung Palace to see the changing guard ceremony at 11am ( only 15min ). First we went to the hanbok counter to get the free hanbok. We can choose the hanbok and we can wear it for photo around the gate for 10min. We took many pictures with the free hanbok.",
          "It was a strange feeling because it was deoksugung which had come decades ago. after the emperor Gojong was abandoned by the pressure of japan in the palace history guidbook, he lived here and was called Deoksugung palace. the name of the palace is not pleasant. However, we was",

          "I seriously fell in love with the palaces in Seoul. This one is definitely definitely recommended to visit. The only palace where you can observe the King\u2019s throne closely. Even though it\u2019s pretty small compared to other palaces, it\u2019s still beautiful. One of the building isn\u2019t",
          "Arrived at this palace 15 minutes before the changing guard ceremony. What i can suggest, please pick a spot facing the gate as usually this side can get a first chance to take a pic with the guards and no crowd yet ;-) One more thing, if you go inside the palace, for senior",
          "We went to see the changing of guards at 11 am. Very interesting ceremony, a loud English voice explains what is happening and afterwards pictures can be taken with the guards. Kids loved it too (6&4 yo); good to go 10-15 min before start to get a spot at the ropes. The palace",
          "Deoksugung is the only palace in Seoul where you can experience being a Royal Palace Chief Gatekeeper and take an active part in the Changing of Royal Guards Ceremony (not just as a spectator). Unlike other palaces, you can also enter the palace grounds at night to enjoy a",
          "Changing of the guards was interesting! Like a short theatre production. Interesting history and buildings. Didn't stay long but unfortunately to walk around. Probably would have leqrnedy more if we rented audio guides or took one of the scheduled free tours.",
          "This is probably the smallest palace in Seoul. But what you go there for is the changing of the royal guard ceremony. It happens right outside the gate so it's free. The ceremony takes place every 11am, 2pm, and 3:30pm. Be there 10-15 minutes before so you can get a good spot",
          "This palace is very easy to get to from the Seoul metro. Changing of the guard is scheduled several times a day. The guards pose with the tourists after the ceremony. Open and main building are lit at night. Grounds have beautiful trees and walking paths.",
          "I liked Deoksugung the least of Seoul's five grand palaces. That's because its myriad buildings present a mishmash of neoclassical Western and traditional Korean architectural styles. A palace since 1593, Deoksugung took on a new look in the early 1900s when King Gojong",
          "Make sure to include this in your itinerary. Walking through the palace corridors, absorbing the rich history and imagining being there as well.",

          "The Palace ground is huge where the palaces of each dynasty are spread over the whole area with the rock walls. interesting history of the palace and also the nice change-of-guards ceremony at the main gate. Good place to visit if one goes for a walking tour with City Hall, Arts",
          "This palace and the surrounding grounds are much smaller than the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace but it is still worth a visit if you have an hour or so to spare. We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was starting (11am) which takes place just in front of the main",
          "Since this is the only Seoul palace you can see illuminated at night, we walked through the Seoullo Sky Garden on both ends (blue lights come on) and then over to this palace nearby. It was beautiful to behold at night.",
          "This was the first temple we visited in Seoul and really enjoyed it. It's a pleasant place to explore and its quiet, given it's located in the centre of the city. The architecture is lovely and tranquil. Do try and come both by day and night as its wonderul when lit up too. Well",
          "I think I might\u2019ve missed the event. I only saw two guards at the gate and they look quiteordered. Enjoyed the visit and it\u2019s nice grounds is that it\u2019s under construction at the moment. Pretty buildings and peaceful",

          "Deoksugung is a lot smaller than the other Seoul palaces (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung) but it's still worth visiting. It's much more quiet and offers a break from the city on a hot day. Take you time and sit around for awhile, observing locals and enjoying the scenery. Since",
          "Something is different here ! The architecture style first, there is 2 building were build on European touch And there is one beautiful museum ! On extra fees of course Second thing, the guard ceremony Superb ! On Morning it s around 11 am ! Don\u2019t miss it",
          "Compared to the other palaces this one has little to offer. As there are just a few buildings where you can walk around and look less impressive compared to others.",
          "We visited as we had a little time and were in the area. It is cheap to visit, but there isnt much to see compared to the other palaces. The changing of the guard ceremony is fun to watch and there is an explanation of what is happening in English. There is some information",
          "Although smaller than the other palaces this place is packed with charm. The changing of the guards happens a few times in the day (I went at 11) and they allow photos up close with them at the end of the ceremony. Buy yourself a 10,000 combo ticket to let you into all the",
          "Deoksungung palace is a must to visit if you come to Seoul. Read little bit of history about the place that it will be easy for you to understand the details when you visit. Wear comfortable dress and shoes that you will need to walk around comfortably.You can enjoy the change",
          "We were fortunate to arrive just as one of the guard changing events was happening at the gates. Very colourful though take the authenticity with a pinch of salt - one of the 'guards' with moustache and pointy beard was definitely a woman Inside it is a delight though not",
          "The palace is not as big as the rest of the other palace around Seoul but the highlight is the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony that is showcase to tourist every day except Monday at 2 different timing (10am and 1pm). One can even take pictures with the guards when the tour",

          "Deoksugung is a small palace near Seoul city hall. Everything is compact, but perfectly conserved. If you don\u2019t have enough time to go other palaces, to visit this one is recommend. It takes about one hour and the entrance is free. The location is very convenient.",
          "This palace is far less tacky than the other palaces in Seoul, where a large proportion of attendees dress in hangbok - traditional clothing for the art of selfie! The buildings are well kept and there has been replicas of thrones put in place to make the complex look more",
          "This palace is one of an attraction that happen in the central of Seoul City. You can easily find this place by simple asking people or just follow google maps. It was a nice to get an experienced about old time of South Korea that long time ago has a massive and great kingdom",
          "We visited it just before sunset, it was our only palace to visit at night, different view and Colours at night. We are unaware if you can visit other palaces at night. We would skip it if they do not open the door at night and illuminate the palace.",
          "Deoksugung, one of the five palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. This is a very small palace. However, the last king of Korea had a sad history as a place where he actually lived. The last king of Korea was the first Korean to drink coffee. I can see where he drank coffee.",

          "The palace was not too large, in compared with Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung, but it was easier to find as it was right out City Hall station and opposite the City Hall of Seoul. Half of the palace was as traditional as other palaces in Korea, but the other half was totally",
          "This place is an absolute must when in Seoul. The walk in the park is refreshing and some of the temples/palaces are dating back two centuries ago. There are also some newer building that have been added in recent times.",

          "This was the last of the palaces I visited on the combination ticket. And I think only the changing of the guard ceremony was good. They have a few timings per day, so do check the schedule and watch it. Quite worth the spectacle. We caught the 3:30pm one. As we were early, we",

          "Nice collection of palaces, both ancient and modern, eastern and western. Quite small compared to other palaces, but well worth visiting as so unique, making great photographic juxtapositions. If visiting on the weekend, go up to Jeonddong Observatory beforehand so as to get a",

          "We stumbled on this palace on our way from Namsan Park to Gyeongbukgong Palace. It costs about $2 USD to enter the palace and it is certainly worth it. Spend about half an hour wandering the beautiful grounds.",

          "Not really that impressive. Can cover the palace ground in less than an hour. However the changing of the guard is quite interesting. It can be viewed at the entrance of the palace and hence not necessary to pay the 1000 won fee. It's done 3 time a day.",
          "Deoksugung is a nice palace that is surrounded by tall buildings and a bustling city. This place is a quick walkthrough compared to other palaces in Seoul, but it's worth a visit if you have been to the other palaces.",

It has very",

          "I find that the most interesting thing about this palace compared to the others in Seoul is that shows the Joseon/Daehan royal family's late attempts to Westernize, which can be seen in the architecture. It's a pity that so much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese after",

        "wiki": "Namdaemun Market is a large traditional market in Seoul, South Korea. The market is located next to Namdaemun, the \"Great South Gate,\" which was the main southern gate to the old city. It is the oldest and largest market in Korea.\n\n\n== History ==\nNamdaemun market dates back to 1414, during the reign of King Taejong, as a government managed marketplace. In 1608, King Seonjo set up the office of seonhyecheong (hangul: \uc120\ud61c\uccad, hanja: \u5ba3\u60e0\u5ef3, \"tribute bureau\") in the district to manage the tributes of rice, cloth and money. A trading marketplace took its form around that time and commercial activities flourished as traders set up various shops. Trade was active in grains, fish, fruit, and miscellaneous goods.The management of the market went over to the Japanese in 1922, but after liberation in 1945 the merchants established the Namdaemun Merchant Organization and took over management. The market, however, turned to ruins during the Korean War and succumbed to fire in 1953. The Seoul Namdaemun Market Co. Ltd. was found in 1954 to rebuild the market, but efforts fell short due to financial troubles. Endeavors for reconstruction continued in the following years, but fires swept the market again in 1968 and 1975.The city of Seoul announced plans to renovate the market in 2007, and reconstruction and renovations are being continued in 2010.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nNamdaemun Market is one of the oldest continually running markets in South Korea, and one of the largest retail markets in Seoul. The streets in which the market is located were built in a time when cars were not prevalent, so the market itself is not accessible by car. The main methods of transporting goods into and out of the market are by motorcycle and hand-drawn carts. It occupies many city blocks, which are blocked off from most car traffic due to the prevalence of parking congestion in the area. The market can be accessed by subway or bus; the location is within a 10-minute walk from Seoul metropolitan station and is even closer to the subway Hoehyeon Station, Line 4.\nMuch of the market is outside, but there are also many stores which line the streets. Many retailers buy their items, particularly clothing, at wholesale prices at Namdaemun, to resell in their own stores in other cities. Namdaemun is a popular tourist attraction. The Market is on the Seoul list of Asia's 10 greatest street food cities for the hotteok.\n\n\n== See also ==\nShopping in Seoul\nList of markets in South Korea\nList of South Korean tourist attractions\n\n\n== References ==\n\nNamdaemun Market (\ub0a8\ub300\ubb38\uc2dc\uc7a5) || South Korea\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPsXxB1QhsE\n\n\n== External links ==\nNamdaemun : Official Seoul City Tourism\nKorean Tourism Organization's site for Namdaemun Market\nNamdaemun Market (in Korean)",

          "I spent half a day to visit this market and I didn't finish my tour! It's absolutely huge, you'd get lost inside it. I was a little bit disappointed about the clothing and jewellery, not good quality and they all look like each others. Much better is the food! Actually I didn't",
          "The Namdaemun market starts just from the Namdaemun Gate (Sungnyemun Gate). It's a pretty big market with food, clothings, accessories, beauty products, electronic stuff, fake goods and many others, but forget the South-East Asia market. Prices aren't so cheap as people may",
          "Love taking souvenirs home and sharing it with family and friends but on a tight budget? Namdaemun Market got your back! They have tons of different souvenirs to choose from such as kitchenwares, clothings for adults and kids, stationeries, accessories, to beauty products, and",
          "So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on",
          "A good place to walk around as it is a big market which sells a variety of things from food to clothes to Kitchen utensil. However, encountered some unpleasant experience with some store owners. Who only focused their attention to Japanese tourist. Where I was in the midst of",
          "If you're looking for a cheap souvenirs or even snacks like in LOTTE mart, you can go here. You also can find some traditional snacks in the evening.",
          "The market is big and bustling. It is more about lower quality, cheaper and fake goods. We thought it might have had more hand crafted things but it didn't.",
          "The market covers several blocks of the city and just about anything can be bought here. Not really a tourist market, much more a real market. There are several good cheap eating places tucked away in the alleys. Many of the establishments have pictures to help choose your food.",
          "There are two main shopping districts in Seoul for buying bulk items. Namdaemun and Dondaemun. You'll find a lot of what you're looking for in Namdaemun plus you'll find plenty of places to feast your palate and stop for a drink after shopping. A must see place while you're in",
          "It was really difficult to buy anything as there were too many shops. Most of the shops sell very similar things from clothing to souvenirs. There malls are tightly packed with stalls selling yet again similar things. Also the fashion was more suitable for the older generation.",
          "We visited Seoul again after few yrs back in 2017,2016 & 2012 via Singapore.We went to Namdaemun market few times whenever we were in seoul and there are many things here & have many choices to choose especially a shopholic like me ^^ This year our second homestay located near",
          "Namdaemun Market is a good place for local food and other traditional custom. It opens up to midnight.",
          "In contrast to many other places in the world, Seoul is not super touristy and Namdaemun even less so. There's mainly Korean locals who shop and dine in the area so you won't really be got with tourist traps or tourist prices. Be careful eating at the street stalls though, you",
          "Enjoyed so much more than Insadong market because it was more authentic and less typical retail. Many products were the same. Allow at least 2 hours. Enjoy!",
          "Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares. Plenty of food stalls to try, but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in - we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised, tasteless and we got only half",
          "It is extremely huge and you\u2019ll probably get lost, it goes underground overground and the streets go on and on. Anything you can imagine you will find here. So big that I actually lost interest and left with only some watermelon.....maybe it\u2019s some twisted Korean reverse",
          "A market where you can find very good street food and nice shops. I like this place and enjoyed the street food",
          "We bought some magnet souvenir and keychain here. We ask the information and they were very friendly. We loves the souvenirs. Overall, Namdaemun Market is very good place to buy souvenir",

          "Huge market south of Sungnyemum Gate. Visited on Sunday afternoon. Appeared less vibrant than Myeongdong (I had visited Saturday afternoon), and didn't have the food stalls. But prices were cheaper (unless I didn't bargain hard enough at Myeongdong). Worth an hour (or two if",
          "A leisurely 15 mins walk from Myeongdong. Love the street food available. A great place for sight, smell and taste. Ate traditional korean bbq. It was fantastic and very reasonably priced. There's a small lane lined with small restos selling mackerel, beef soup etc. So yummy.",

          "Quaint it ain't. Namdaemun Market is huge. Not just a rabbit warren of streets selling everything you can imagine: from kitchenware to clothing, from bags to braised pig knuckles, there are numerous warehouse-sized buildings to explore. To get a good deal, you need to bargain.",
          "The area is buzzing with vendors and above and underground shops to sell you almost everything under the sun. You can walk and pick your spots totry a taste of Seoul or you can walk through the alley corridors to slide into ine of the many restaurants to eat like a local. It's",
          "It\u2019s a Traditional market with food and souvenirs, Kids clothing, matured ladies clothing, lots lots products, very cheap price if compare the underground street. Walking distance from Mengdong. Suggest to go at day time, shops will close at night.",

          "We visited in the afternoon and there were lots and lots of stores that sell similar stuff. They sell clothes, shoes, souvenirs, kpop merchandise... the prices were more or less the same but some were cheaper. We did not spend much time there though since the place did not look",
          "Much talked about this site thus the need to venture it. Indeed there are lots of shops/stores to venture but it was not my forte as I dont really like crowded area and confusing lanes. Maybe, I am not prepared for it. However we did some shopping here and as soon as we are",
          "This is the oldest and largest traditional market in Korea. It is spread out over many blocks with about 10,000 vendors. Nowhere else in Korea can you find such an array of items. It was an interesting place to wander through even without buying anything. And it's named for the",
          "This is a huge market selling different items. There are some maps saying which street sells what but we just took a wonder around. We saw a lot of shops selling shoes or hats or phone accessories. There was also a home-wear section. Some shops selling Korean souvenirs. We",
          "The amount of shops were lesser and less touristy as compared to Myeongdong. There were, I think, more food stalls though.",
          "Majority of the clothings sold are very dated. Good for shopping of children clothings but not adult. Some vendors there are pretty unfriendly too. Pricing of souveniers are either the same or higher than what you can find at express bus terminal shopping area. I would suggest",
          "Maybe it was because I visited Nandaemun on a weekday evening, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019d just come from Taiwan where the night markets are world-renowned, but this is a very unremarkable market selling a limited selection of food. Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and",
          "There were some good bits to visiting Namdaemun markets . We didn\u2019t see the deep fried baby crab anywhere else and the dumplings were excellent. The busy hot and narrow food alleys with kitchens along the walkways were a sight to see if not too enticing to eat at. Nevertheless I",
          "Namdaemun Market is quite a large place, selling a variety of products - clothing, bags, food, etc. If you want something cheap, best come here instead of going to the department stores. Also lots of places to sit down and have a coffee or snack.",

          "Very crowded market with lots of different shops selling the exact same stuff as all the other markets. They seem to have a high demand on phone cases in this country. We had very nice heotteok here.",

          "I didn\u2019t particularly care for this market. Too much cheap stuff in jam packed spaces and hoards of people. People rummaging through clothes scattered across tables, cheap knock off handbags, tee-shirts, etc. I did enjoy delicious bibimbap at a small restaurant nestled just",
          "Typical Asian market. Very nice to visit and get an impression of how people live eat and dress. Every time we are in Seoul we visit this place.",
          "If you are in Seoul, you definitely need to check out their markets. It is organized chaos and something to behold. All manner of food stuffs (although seaweed seems to predominate) and ready to eat street food vendors. One of my guides indicated there were some 27,000 retailers",
          "This market is worth a visit. Many curious things are traded here. For example there is s shop that sells gift packaging materials, so if you are looking for a special wrapping for a gift this is the place.",
          "Remember this is not the Galleria Mall here...we are talking huge quantities of cheap mass produced items. They have. clothing, furs , suitcases, food (massive food market starts at 4:00). Look for the candy vendor that makes candy from cornstarch. They insert a filling that",
          "Went there for street food but it is almost inexistant and scattered all around the huge market. If you are after something similar to markets in Thailand, this is not the place",
          "Enjoyed the street food. Deep fried baby crabs especially. The shopping is not very interesting but still worth looking at. A good place to find very local food",

          "I visited Namdaemun. I could feel the traditional market of Seoul. The grilled fish restaurant inside Namdaemun was delicious. I recommend it. It was nice to walk to Myeongdong after eating at Namdaemun restaurant.",

          "Namdaemun Market is a must when visiting Seoul. Nighttime visit is a lot better than during the day. My wife always finds several things to buy every time we visit. Remember where the restrooms are, sometimes they are hard to find. Tourist information teams can be found",
          "This is one of the largest traditional outdoor market in the middle of Seoul. Varieties of foods and goods are endless here. Love tasting some quick snacks from street vendors location in central part of the market alley. It still retains its charms from bygone era",

          "We stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel just opposite this market and my wife went crazy shopping in here for clothes for our daughter, so many stalls to choose from, so many new and stylish clothes for our kid. Bring lots of cash or stick to a budget, try getting some discount and it",

          "Not necessary to visit this place. So many better places to go. This market is filled with cheap t-shirt and hair accessories, knock off bags, etc. Nothing that you would go to Seoul for. If you do feel you need to go, be sure to go down some of the smaller alleys, as those are",

For me, most of what was for sale at Namdaemun is junk. I didn\u2019t buy anything. Still, Namdaemun is worth the time. Wouldn\u2019t go again, but",

          "Variety of food and merchandise to see and buy",
          "If you want to buy Korean souvenir this is the better place i think (sorry i didn't take a picture of the store of souvenir). The price is  more cheaper than Myeongdong. But if you buy t-shirt better you look the one made in Korea because the quality is different, the material is more softer.",

          "We had such a great time here. There is an App you download when you go in which brings the place to life. We had so much fun taking videos and pictures and there is even an opportunity to get your portrait done as an oil painting, which was a great keepsake to take home. A",
          "This place is a lot of fun! I was traveling alone so I got a guide to accompany me so I could get some great photos. They have an app that works with some of the exhibits to get you some really cool videos and photos.",
          "The ice museum on the side is not really worth a visit, especially if you have seen ice sculptures elsewhere. Little kids would love it though. The Trick Eye concept is very clever - though sharing your photos with them might be risky. It is only 12000w entry, and a nice",
          "I visited this attraction with my wife and teenage daughters. I would not call it a museum but rather, an attraction. I am in my early 50s and don't have an intuitive understanding of how to manipulate the VR to maximum effect. My daughter, on the other hand, is masterful.",
          "It\u2019s about 5 mins walk from Hongik University stop exit 9, a bit difficult to find the building name as it isn\u2019t clearly visible and my Google maps hung up on me ! Coming to the place , it\u2019s quite fun if you like taking pictures , it\u2019s not that big , but bigger than few others",
          "This place is great for people taking photos of yourselves and each other! It's fun, entertaining and well done!",
          "Small place but worth the little money you spend. First time I have been to a place like this and my wife and I had a good time. Not to crowded and it conveniently located in the same building as the Love Museum and Ice Museum. Also has several things to do close by so makes for",
          "Had some trouble finding this attraction because it is located in a building without a clear and obvious sign. After figuring out which building it was then also had the difficult of finding the entrance which is at the basement of the building, which it shares with another",
          "Nothing to shout about. Had it not been a free pass from Discover seoul pass, we won't have visited the place.",
          "The trickeye portion is ok but I expected all pictures to have AR effects, not just 4. The VR portion was very bad. The only ride that was working for 2 people was a roller coaster. There are so many boring VR rollercoasters and this is one of them. All other rides were broken",

          "Considering this place is top rated amongst tourist. I feel that there needs to be some kind of guidance. There was a language barrier and no one could assist us on how things worked. Also the space is very limited. Too many people going in at once, no room to take pictures and",

          "I\u2019m not sure why this place has received so many positive reviews. It\u2019s a gimmicky place that is reminiscent of a Fun House at a County Fair. However, it is not at all suitable for children.",

          "It is a little time consuming and tedious sometimes, but it is definitely a fun experience. The photos are better without the AR sometimes and the AR APP really drains phone battery. But if you don't mind looking silly and getting down and dirty for pics, it is a lot of fun",
          "This is a place for selfie lovers, photographers... the technology is really cool to experience, can get a little frustrating as some people walk into your frame right as your about to take the pic. Note the ice section is absolutely freezing and very small. I was in and out",

          "Trickeye Museum Seoul went up the next level by being the first to introduce augmented reality in its photo attractions. We had lots of fun here. You can also purchase a combined ticket to the Ice Museum, VR arcade or Beauty Inside Exhibition too. Good to spend an hour or two",
          "I went to the Trick eye Museum with a friend, they have a lot of various interactive pictures thanks to their application. It really feels like you are getting inside of the pictures and they are very realistic! Got a lot of fun staying there. we staid there for around an hour",
          "Being in the Trickeye Museum is like being transported to different places at one time. The 3D art were so unique and I had so much fun taking pictures there.",
          "two people for $22, very reasonable, and the experience was great. We took some of our favorite photos of the entire trip at the trick eye museum, especially the portrait handing the flower and the giant fish-monster (it'll make sense if you go)",
          "For $11 per person this was a fun experience. We got some pretty memorable photos, probably our favorite on the trip. Worth checking out if you're in the area.",
          "They have an app that you can download that makes the art come to life. I've never seen anything like it and I imagine that we will soon all over the world. It was really fun (even as two adults). There's also tons of great street food near the venue. Bring change for the",
          "use the app to take animation is funny, can spend at least 2 to 3 hours playing with the animation, during our visit (morning), there was not so many people, it is important, so that we can take photo freely anywhere",
          "Do not visit this museum when you are alone. You just loose your money. People working there are extremely unfriendly and not helpfull at all. They refuse to rake even a single picture for you. I payed a lot of money just to be there alone. It has absolutely no meaning visiting",
          "so much fun and unique. you can download an app that will activate an interactive scene with audio and video, like a dragon roaring and breathing fire with you in front of it. there are some risque scenes of nudity but nothing you can't laugh off with kids. there's also an",
          "The visit was very interesting, some optical illusions were quite impressive and funny. However, you need to download the museum's app to use the proper camera inside ; it makes your phone heat up and lose battery quickly. I would recommend going right at the opening hour or",
          "A very good place to enjoy taking nice funny pictures. It\u2019s good for ppl of all ages who just want to have fun.",
          "We had such a fun experience here! Kids enjoyed it just as much as the adults. Make sure to download the free interactive app while you\u2019re there. It will make your pictures come to life! Fabulous and well-worth the visit!",
          "My family of eight visited the Trick Eye Museum June 2019. It was very underwhelming. First you download their app onto your phone and then take videos of friends moving in front of a picture. The app allows animated action to take place and when you play it back it is fun. The",
          "SOOOOO we thought this would be a fun way to kill an hour or two---- it was absolutely stuffed with pushy tourists who have no sense of personal space, so any chance of getting a cool pic was totally ruined. Would not recommend.",
          "I had a great time with my friends in the museum. I recommended them to go for taking photos and there is still the supermoon that can take beautiful picture. Friends were surprised to see the AR effect in the APP and it's new to my friends. Also, new corner is added near",
          "It's a cool place in Hongdae to have fun with family! It's good to download the Trickeye carema apps to get 3D effect for the picture!",

          "is a fun place to visit for everyone~ strongly recommend to download the camera apps to capture photo or video",
          "Using 3D augmented application, photos and videos get interesting and live. Fun place if you go with someone together. With one ticket you can visit both Trick eye museum and Ice museum, and it is worthy enough for 15k won. Ice museum was pretty cool, but make sure you have warm",
          "I had such a fun time here with my wife and sister-in-law. So many cool and interesting backdrops to take photos with. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to walk through everything. There was also free entrance into an ice museum within the same building, which was small but still",
          "Very interesting using a 3D Augmented Reality App , you can film a short video as you become part of the action. It is worth a visit if you have a couple hours to kill especially on a rainy day. Also, included was the Ice musuem with some interesting ice sculptures in a giant",
          "We visited the Trickeye Museum in Seoul and spent a few hours there. It has a downloadable app which activates special effects in most of their displays like a fire-breathing dragon. The app acts as a camera which you use to take photos with the special effects. The Ice Museum",
          "a wonderful few hours at this museum. full of illusions. they have free wifi and an app that helps you fully enjoy it so don't forget to download it for great pictures",
          "This is a great day out. You will need to download the trickeye app to take full advantage of the various optical illusions they have here.",
          "TrickEye museum was good! With the TrickEye app, it was fun clicking pictures and recording videos. Ice museum is a total waste of money/time.",
          "At first I was a bit skeptical as to the level of fun to be had. My family and I were pleasantly surprised. We laughed a lot and giggled at many of the resultant pictures and effects. Downloading their app was a bit annoying; however, the annoyance was quickly replaced with",
          "The museum is one of the 36 places of interest with free entry with the purchase of the Seoul Tourist Card. We took the Green line on the Metro arriving at Hongik Station. About a five minute walk should have got us there, but the street signs and the building blocks confused",
          "Cost is 15,000/person and covers only TrickEye and ice museum. The whole thing lasted about ~2 hours. There are a ton of different pictures with cool effects in the background using the TrickEye app. Some of them are cool, some of them are bland. It\u2019s very creative an",
          "Well, it's fun and all but there isn't much to do in there. You'd literally be done exploring in 15 minutes. I'm being charitable with my review just because I loved their interactive 3D app. Ice museum was boring though...",
          "Your ticket gets you access to the truck eye museum and the ice museum. After downloading their app 2-d paintings have 3-d movements. It was a lot of fun",
          "Many photos has been taken and it was fun in the museum. And using the app to see the trickeye picture is a fresh experience in 4D museum. I 'wow' many times while using the app to see picture. Also there is new comer that has a supermoon for people to take photo. it is",
          "I have been to several museums of this kind, but what made this one special was a dedicated app that made the art move or added some elements to the picture. Take someone along so you can take pictures of each other. The entry costs 15,000 won and includes the tiny Ice Museum on",
          "Lots of fun--my husband and I are in our 50's and were probably the oldest people there. BUT it was lots of fun, well worth the cost and the pictures were lots of fun. Lots of laughs, and fighting dinosaurs was adorable",
          "Bit of a con. Nothing special, actually pretty weak. You have to do the experience using an app which annoyingly runs off your smart phone so drains the battery and definately not suitable for kids. The only interesting part is the VR arcade and they charge extra for that. Avoid!",
          "A nice place to go to if you enjoy taking pictures. At the time I went it wasn't too crowded, so pretty easy to take a picture. I believe if I had went at a busy time of the year it would of been difficult to take any pics since people tend to stand around forever and they tend",
          "We really didn't know what we were getting into when we decided to visit the Trickeye Museum and we came on the recommendation of a friend who visited with their two kids earlier this year. Be sure your smartphone is charged as your whole experience and the memories you take",
          "There were a few pictures which were neat, but several were confusing. It was crowded and made taking pics difficult. Would not recommend.",
          "So, I went here alone as I was in the neighbourhood shopping and didn\u2019t want to drag my coworker along with me while I browsed 100 beauty stores. I quickly realized that was a big mistake as 98% of this attraction is basically posing with different scenes and taking photos",
          "It's quite okay, but I think the place is kind of over priced just for you to take unique and 3D photos. But if you're the type who love to have tons of photo updates in your social media, then you might love the visit to this place.",
          "I went here and it was nice. There are many different attractions to see and do. Go here for some photos and fun time with your family and friends.",
          "What ever you do, do not visit the Trickeye Museum. It is cheaply constructed and there are barely any optical illusions. All of us in our group were highly disappointed.",
          "Me and my wife went to the trick eye museum and ice museum. There is an AR to download for free. With the AR app things looks much more realistic and I highly recommend you to check this museum out if you are in Hongdae!",
          "It's interesting and I enjoyed my visit there. It's really only for photo taking so if you're not a fan of having photos taken, then don't go, as it's not much fun only looking. I went on my own and I was lucky visitors there were happy to take a photo of me when I asked them.",
          "This was a very unique experience. The interactive displays automatically link to your phone once you download their app. Recommended for a few hours.",
          "The trick eye museum is great to take pictures in with friends, but it isn't overwhelmingly fun. It is only a small distance from Hongdae exit 9 which is handy - but I would only recommend it to kill 45 mins to an hour of your time if you are doing something else in Hongdae.",
          "Visitors can enjoy taking tricky pictures/videos using a mobile application, the photos seem so real. So funny place",
          "Really fun and you can spend more than two hours to take the photos. Please remember to download the app before you take any photos and also put your backpack to the locker, just 500 won. Just take your wallet and camera is good enough.",
          "Its just awful. Do i regret going? im not sure, Its so bizarre. I was embarrassed in there and left with in 5 mins. The photos... well i won't be showing them on our holiday pic slide show. Was it worth it? It was different, fairly cheap hilarious to watch others and just a bit",
          "Great place! A lot of fun, its incredible that this is the first on america! Bring your hole family and a full loaded battery so you can enjoy it properly.",
          "This experience is so much fun. My husband and I visited this place. We will be visiting again and this time, with the kids. They will surely enjoy this. Get ready with your acting skills.",
          "A really fun place. We took our kids and they loved it! Great technology makes it even better! Would definitely go back again!",
          "Really fun and LOTS of pictures plus you meet others who are willing to joke around as you take pics! Tons of variety when it comes to the pictures and creativity is involved heavily. Vr is amazing!",
          "The technology is better and better now. The Trickeye Museum provides fantastic 4D app that allow taking wow pictures and videos beyond your imagination. We did have pleasant surprises from using this fantastic app. By using this app, dinosaurs are moving, angels are flying,",
          "It is a nice place to visit especially if it's too cold to do something outdoors. It's pricey (much more expensive than the pass to see all palaces) and you must bring your own smartphone to \"see\" the CGI on the screen. Internet connection is sometimes slow, so you must wait",
          "Nice experience. We had a lovely day at this wierd museum. We took a lot of great photos we can post on social media",
          "The museum is very funny. You gotta download the app to properly enjoy the animations. If you are in a group, would v\u00ea better to take group pictures. It has a Nice mirror room at the end!",
          "Had a really great time with my wife, lots of pictures to take and the AR portion is pretty cool. Should try atleast once.",
          "This place was a very unique and cool experience. My only wish is that it would be a longer expierence, but it definitely is something to not miss.",
          "Nice museum. Ice museum is especially impressive. You should really check it out if you have some time in Seul",
          "I had a great time with my friend. Definitely recommend this museum for groups. Fantastic opportunity to take an unusual photo.",
          "This is a must do in Seoul. You can easily kill an hour here with friends. It\u2019s a very interesting experience to have with the augmented reality",
          "Definitely worth going. You can use the augmented reality app to take some really cool pictures. The ice section was very cold but realistic",
          "A once in a lifetime experience best enjoyed with friends or family. It is definitely worth the price",

          "I've recently visited this museum as part of my bucket list for places to see before I leave Korea. It was a lot of fun and overall a great experience. There was also a helper who would kindly take pictures of me and my friend whenever we needed one. And there are A LOT of spots",

          "Totally overhyped. Boring as can be after the novelty of the first few exhibits wears off. Need the app to see most of the \"tricks\" which are basically just CGI overlays. App will drain ur battery too. Was looking forward to actual trompe l'oiel art, which can be very creative,",
          "Really fun activity basically for everyone! I've been there 3 times and it only gets better. Now, when we can use the trickeye app, it makes the whole experience really unforgettable. I highly recommend it!",
          "I went to this museum with my family and all of us thought that was a very fun place to go. However, it was a bit crowded when we got there so I guess it'd be better if you could go as early as possible to avoid the crowd.",
          "I visited the Trickeye Museum with a friend and we had so much fun! Especially now that they have the Trickeye App, our experience was even more exciting, as we were able to take lots of amazing photos and videos in Augmented Reality!",

          "It was kind of difficult to find, but once we did it was amazing! Interactive pieces of art. Truly brings out the kid in you. Also the ice house is super fun be sure you bring a coat! Would definitely go again",
          "We spent hours here perfecting our acting skills and photography. I recommend trying to go there not on a public holiday or a weekend. Lots of people. Many pictures you need one or two takes to get it right. It\u2019s actually best to go with al least 3 people as many of the trickeye",
          "Looking for someplace to go when it\u2019s raining looking to just have fun . You should check them out . The location is a but out of range you stopped to ask questions a few times but when you get there it\u2019ll be fun . It\u2019s actually a make of 3 sections , the love museum which is",

          "We had a few hours to kill before heading to the Olympics and I found the cool museum in the Hongik College area. The pictures online intrigued us so we thought we would take a shot. For 15,000 won, you could visit the Ice and TrickEye museums...both worth it in their own ways.",
          "This place is awesome and is great for days when the weather is not. It is best to go with at least one other person so you may take pictures of each other interacting with the art.",
          "A museum of optical illusion. It as fun, but at times too crowded (trying to take pictures while people walk in front). I would recommend if you are looking for something unique, to spend an hour. Going once is enough.",
          "It's the 1st Trick Eye/ 3D Museum that has AR Technology to make you feel more fun when you are watching & posing with a lot of nice 3D pictures. It's better for you to download the App \"Trickeye\" in your mobile phone in advance. (If you did not, they also provide free WiFi",
          "Out of all the attractions in South Korea, this was the one place I was super keen to visit. I thoroughly enjoyed all the illusions and it made for super fun imagery!! Looking through others photos, there were lots of displays there that isn't there anymore, I wish they could",
          "The Museum did not look much at the outside, but we had so much fun inside! Climbing up down the pictures or statues, swinging and walking and taking all sorts of funny pictures. Bring out the children and actor/actress in us! We look at the pictures again. They are certainly",
          "Fun for 8-10 year olds. Big room for virtual reality. You could spend lots of time there, depending on how many pictures you want to take. Exciting for a group of children, not just one. Requires you to download an app, to take pictures with special effects. Wouldn't be the same",
          "We visited the trickeye museum and it was a great experience for a family with kids. There is a free app to work with the museum but it will drain your battery. I highly recommend!",

          "The trickeye museum was really a funny experience and people from all age seem to enjoy it. The price is around 15,000 W / person and there are a series of stops within a space to pose and make pictures. As soon as it gets a bit crowded it gets hard to make the pictures from the",
          "It is a fun museum to visit, but it is not looking that good. A lot of visitors have made the painting worn and it does not look that nice anymore. But if you haven't been to a trick eye museum before, it is worth a visit.",
          "Price are not expensiv. It's a bit difficult to find. The woman at the ticket box speak english and explain you everything with a smile.The museum is actually 2 different museum the trickeye museum and the ice museum. You can't choose. It's better to have a smartphone with you",
          "Even we are no kids anymore, we had fun there. It's a bit pricey, but it is a really nice and funny thing to do, we took lots of pictures that make me still laugh. The price also includes the ice museum which is tiny, but fantastic when you go there in summer - it was the only",
          "I vistied trick eye with my boyfriend during the summer and It was one of the memorable experience that my boyfriend and I talk about all the time. Since it was a really hot and humid summer in Korea, we both wanted to escape from the heat. This Trickeye museum was a great",

          "It was our first time to the Trick Eye Museum. It's a fun place to visit, especially if you like to take photos. The ticket included the Ice Museum next door.",
          "It is not fair to call this a museum. It is just a playground for kids and no tourist attraction at all in my mind unless for people with kids up to about 10 y.o. Can not recommend it for the regular tourist. Do something else.",
          "The Trickeye Museum is an interesting place to visit and it's free. There are several areas where there are distorted drawings on the floor, but when you take a photo of the drawings at a certain angle they turn out looking normal! They have a virtual ride, where you put on",
          "See title. Good if you are in groups ( one or two friends maybe), even better one of you like taking photos and posing for pictures! Had great fun here as it wasn't crowded:) but need to choose a time to visit as it lost its fun if there are groups of people~ so be aware! Price?",
          "Trickeye museum is a good place to visit for both couples or friends. There is alot of different themes to take pictures off. You can walk through the museum in about 1 to 1.5 hour if you want to take alot of pictures. Entrance fee is 15 000 won for adults if you download their",

          "It was a cold day, I had read about this place, so thought we would take a look. It was 12000krw to get in, so not expensive. Some of the exhibits were cool, some were a bit lame. Some required some flexibility to get into the right spot for the photo We had a laugh, and it",

          "We turned up just as a large tour group also arrived. It made it difficult to fully explore all the exhibits as there were long lines for each one. I think if you were to go when it was quieter it would be much more enjoyable. The ice museum (also included in ticket price) had",

          "Its a must have experience when visiting Korea. It is available for all ages and anyone can have fun. Just make sure you charge your camera before you go. A minimum of 2 hours of fun awaits you and for adults there's also another 30mins of fun.",
          "I wasn't too excited about visiting this museum since I thought it was for kids. Well guess what?! My sister and I ended up having too much fun and stayed way longer than we expected. It was a bit crowded in the afternoon so we had to often wait for our turn to take pictures.",
          "Overall a simple museum, but we got some funny pictures we shared with friends and family. The staff was very helpful, there are tricks to lighting and because we were a single couple, it was great that she was able to take pictures for us and show us how to light our faces",

          "I visited with some friends and I have to say that for such a small museum, the fun was huge. Lots of awesome murals to take some convincing photos. The ice museum which was also included on the ticket was also fun, cold, but worth seeing. I recommend It. What I love the most",
          "The museum is really small but the paint is really impressive! You can easy spend 2 hours inside taking really convincing photographs!",

          "This museum has some fun illusions to take funny pictures, but it definitely didn't seem worthy of the high ratings it has on here. I also found the price (15,000 won) a bit much considering how much in Seoul is both more worthwhile and cheaper. It wasn't bad, but I would have",
          "Trickeye museum is some distance from Hongik University station. It is at the basement of a building with the love museum which is not accessible to children. Some of the paintings at Trickeye are faded due to people touching or leaning against them. There is no clear sign",
          "First time I came a cross something like that. Really fun. Can take fun photos and burn some time with fun. Recommended.",
          "A pretty lame collection of tired back drops for visitors to take cheesy photos that create optical illusions. Bit of fun for the kids but overall not worth the effort in a city with so much more to offer.",
          "Have visited other similar places before. I would say this is not the most impressive one . The place is also quite old.",
          "Great combination of visual trickery. Easy to find and cheap. At this time of the year it was empty. Told that in high season it is very popular and busy. The ice area is also quite good",
          "The Trickeye Museum and Ice museum are in the same building, and the admission tickets include both places. The place isn't big but packed with people when we're there. You can really do some cool photo/illusion pictures. We had fun.",
          "Definitely a great place not to be missed if you are travelling with family with children. Just need to let your hair down and have fun taking all the fun shots with family members. We had lots of laughter together throughout the tour. Entrance ticket was 15k\u20a9 for adult and",

          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum! Initially, the idea of taking pictures with optical illusions didn't seem huge, but when you're actually there, you'll realize how amazing these paintings are. Figuring out how to pose as well as taking the picture from the best angle is super",

          "This place is unlike any museum I've ever seen. It gets top marks for uniqueness alone. The best to describe it: it's just a whole lot of pictures on walls that you actually enter and become part of, and then have your photo taken as if you're part of the art! Well worth the",
          "Awesome place to visit in seoul. I would like everyone who are searching for a place to visit in seoul,visit once and i am sure u will refer back others to visit this place.",
          "Although, it was fun to walk around the museum was crowded with people crazy for pictures! Its open until 9pm so it might be a better idea to go later in the evening!",

          "Whilst this place is entertaining, it is definitely not worth the high entrance fee. It is made up of about three rooms with painted walls where you can take photos. We went on the middle of the week day and it was still busy enough that we couldn't really get to some of the",
          "Had some much fun as whole family taking cool tricky photos with cool backgrounds. Spent about 1 hr in the museum taking funny pictures. The ice museum was ok( Long Beach Queen Mary Ice event is lot better). This one is very small and tight when you have bus load of kids",

          "If you have nothing to do after a long trip, then Trickeye Museum could be good to be added to your Things To Do only if you love taking photos of yourself or your friends. It's a bit pricey. Otherwise, hanging around the area (Hongdae) is good enough.",

          "the museum is hidden in a busy shopping street. Sometime you may pass by without seeing it. I have a good time there. Beware that lots of children in this attraction so try to avoid the peak hour during the afternoon if you would like some quiet time. Beside, i recommend that",
          "The trickeye museum is worth a visit and have some very interesting things inside. But I recommend to take a friend or not go alone as I did as u need someone to take a photo of u or someone. It's a 2min walk up a busy Street where cars cannot go. A little hard to find but worth",
          "We had a lot of fun taking silly pictures, but it was quite crowded and clearly a big draw for tourists. We got some great photos out of it. One thing - there is a photo setup that is offensive (posing with an afro with a pick in it) that I think Trickeye should remove.",
          "To me, this museum was brilliant because I had never done anything like it before. Placing yourself in situations make images come alive and give the impression that you're actually within them. It's an interesting concept. Not something to cancel all your plans for, but if you",

          "We had the best time on a recent visit to Trickeye! My hubby and I went with another couple and we spent hours wandering around trying to get the perfect pictures. There are lots of different scenes that you pose in front of, behind, on top of.... And the \"trick\" comes in when",
          "Good for family , solo, group travellers. Fee applies for entry into the museum and the ticket is used also for entry to the adjacent ice museum. Trick eye museum has the spots earmarked from where the photographs are to be taken to get the tricked photos. Ice museum",
          "Great place to enjoy with your friends and loved ones. We took many pics and had great fun. there was 3 parts :trick eye,Ice area, carnival. firstly the ice are was -4 c and was really cold but we enjoyed it.The trick eye is a must see attraction.",
          "Take your camera and get ready to have fun. This museum was fun and had quite a bit of variety for all to include an ice exhibit. The ice exhibit was extremely cold and would have been better if they had coats or at least a warning, but it was part of the fun. It wasn't too",
          "Lol. Lotsa 3D stuff and painting where you could actually be in it! Great for memorable moments and good for photography.",
          "It was an awesome experience for me. I got to visit this place after a hectic week at work. I could unwind myself in few minutes after entering the museum. The greatest part is you can make a fool out of yourself and pose for photos and enjoy yourself without feeling",
          "My sisters and I had fun taking pictures and laughing at the same time. This museum is very creative and well thought of. I hope that they 'll create more illusions in the future :) The staff were very helpful, friendly and accommodating. Because I enjoyed this attraction/",
          "It was a fun and unique experience I guess. Wife wife and daughter enjoyed it. There are many different places to pose, take photos, etc. There is a little mirror maze to exit. Don't forget to check out the Ice Museum. It was different. Ice cold sculptures and a little slide",
          "The kids loved Trickeye museum and taking all the photos. Ice sculptures on the same floor was nice too.",
          "Go early. We went an hour before closing time and we were not able to see the carnival museum. Fun for everyone especially kids. 3D paintings are average; its really up to your drama skills to make the paintings alive and more interesting.",
          "I enjoyed everything about this museum. I had so much fun in it and it had a 50% discount! If I travel back to Seoul, I will visit I this museum again.",
          "I liked the idea of the museum it was funny tricky and we enjoyed our time but we faced little difficulty to know how to take the right photo if there is a guide or better instructions will be easier",
          "The trick eye museum is a clich\u00e9 place to bring some visitors. The outside looks like a dodgy apartment building and the trickeye museum is located downstairs at B3. Some of the \"trick-eye\" photos are really great. The little boy peeing - hilarious! The trick room where you",

          "The trick eye museum was a fun way to spent a couple of hours. It basically is taking pictures of yourself in the trick eye sets. We also did the ice museum we where only in there for a couple of minutes took some photos and got out because it was freezing.",
          "if you love to pose then this is the place to be... u can spend good 3-4 hours here clicking all kind out tricky pics.. Prices at 15000.per person it gives you entry to trick eye + ice house + carnival.. a must visit place",
          "The trickeye museum is very funny to do with friends. You can take great pictures of you (flying, being giant, being eaten by a shark,...). Just next to the museum is the ice museum and the love museum. I would definitely advise this museum.",
          "This was definitely a cool place to visit. There are so many photo ops with quirky and fun subject matters, so don't forget your camera! We were with a large tour group, so it made stopping to take pictures at the ones you wanted to difficult at times because there were too many",
          "It's super fun but only if you go with another person to take pictures for you. Fast to go through but the ticket includes this the ice museum and the carnival section.",
          "Trickeye puts you inside unbelievable settings from classical paintings to fantasy locations. Set after set gives you lots of photo ops. Everyone likes posing and then instantly seeing the pics.",
          "A fun place to go with friends. Make sure your camera is fully charged and has room for lots of photos because you'll be taking a lot. You pay for 2 museums in one: ice museum and the trick eye. The ice museum is really small and REALLY cold. We didn't want to spend much time in",
          "I loved every bit of this museum. It was so funny and our pictures turned out to be extremely hilarious. They have so many funny 3D images inside and you can get yourself clicked at every step. Don't go there alone as you would need a companion to get yourself clicked. There was",
          "This museum was a fun surprise. It was included in our combo ticket and we thought we would give it a try at the conclusion of the Seoul Tower (since it is located at the base of the tower). Photography is encouraged and visitors become part of the artwork. Allow 45 minutes to",
          "A fabulous place to pop into with kids. Make sure you wear something that will blend into the pictures and you'll have some fun! Leave your coats and bags in the lockers.",
          "when a friend was visiting around halloween, I learned from their website that they were offering free admission to those who came in costumes -- definitely fun and a great way to spend a few hours (if you take pictures at every station like we did), but i'm not sure if I would",
          "Good places to make funny and good captures. Our Ticket including ice museum. You must come with friend or family to do the perfect angle-shoot. Solo travel maybe will little bit difficult and confusing.",

          "Entry costs around 15,000 won but you won't be disappointed (children under the age of 18 pay 12,000 won). I know of some travel websites occasionally give way promotions where you print the e-voucher, you are able to get about 10-15% off. Located in the lively and youthful",
          "Not surprising that this place has become so famous in Seoul. You'd wanna come here for bright emotions and laughs. And, of course, the photos are mind-blogging. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "This is a great place to visit though a bit difficult to find. plenty of photo opportunities that made you worth your while coming here.",
          "Yes, its really fantastic the way they art it and placed the things. Those makes you feel you did things in real if we look from camera.",
          "Be sure to get your camera ready! It's fun if you come along with your friends/family and do all sorts of weird and silly poses. The only thing is you have to queue and wait for other people to take their photos, meanwhile you can roam around freely. As for foreigners, remember",
          "it was indeed a fun activity for everyone. one of the kind and i guess a pioneer in this kind of activity. we went here around late afternoon... i guess it is their peak hour... but it doesnt matter... we did enjoy our time and a must for anyone who will visit seoul.",
          "The entrance ticket cost 15,000KRW and that includes the Trick Eye Museum, The Ice Room and the Street Carnival. It is located very close to the Hongdae Nanta Theater and there are signs around there letting you know it is in the general vicinity. We went in and took some pretty",
          "This museum is loads of fun. We took about 150 photos of us interacting with the 3D art. It made us feel like youngsters again. As we were a couple traveling by ourselves, everyone was quite nice about taking photos of us together. And we reciprocated. The museum was a bit",
          "It is a trickeye museum cum ice museum. Many photo opportunities. Quite alot of tourists. Discount vouchers are only valid for adults, not valid for children. The museum is not very big, we exit within 1 hour. We find the price more expensive than Alive museum.",
          "Took the kids here after walking around all day. Got there about an hour before closing. It is not the most obvious of locations and needed to use GPS to find the building. The building is set back in a section of streets filled with cafes and bars. But it's seoul, so we felt",
          "Its quiet funny to go there with friends and to take some funny pictures. But we went there when it was quiet full and this is just annoying to wait hours until u can make ur own trick eye effect pictures.",
          "The \"museum\" is 3D selfies backdrops with a 15000 won entry fee for it and the \"Ice sculpture museum\". Not the kind of business model that would work outside of Asia, I think.... but twenty-somethings here love it.",
          "Trick Eye is a good place to kill an hour or so. The smallish space is packed with optical illusion backgrounds. We had lots of fun posing with these and took heaps of photos. We also visited ice world (same building and part of the price) which was very good. We visited",
          "It's not big and doesn't have many pictures as I thought. Went there only if you don't have anything to do.",
          "It is a nice place to go as a couple, friends, or with your kids. But definitely not alone! Bring your camera with you and try to get the best shot! Worth the visit, and can be a good alternative to spend your day if it's raining. Could have been a bit cheaper.",
          "It's really worth it, So if you're in Seoul, you should go there! It will be a great experience and you'll enjoy it all the way. I still check my pictures from day day even afer one year, because this kind of museum is rare.",
          "Visited this museum again for the third time with different group of friends each time. This time round they have new and different designs (for trick eye museum and ice museum). It is so sweet and cute. Managed to pose with some of the new designs. As usual, there were a lot of",
          "Fun way to spend an hour taking pictures of all the exhibits. Be prepared to lay on the floors for good shots. Also, there are tourist discounts if you print the voucher online.",
          "It was our first time visiting this place and fun it amusing. The pictures were funny and we,made some good memories.",
          "The museum consists of many backdrops where visitors can pose and in photographs it will look like they are floating on a magic carpet or in the mouth of a giant fish. The kids (ages 8 and 11) thought it was hilarious, but it was sort of expensive.",
          "If you like to take photos & post in social media then this is the place to be!!! It's a different kind of experience.",
          "A nice place to visit. Your ticket to the tickeye is bundled with the Ice museum ticket as well. here, it seems like you're part of the paintings. There are marked photo spots that will help you get a better shots. The also change the paintings. Most of the paintings that I saw",
          "I am surprise to see this museum is quite small if compare to Singapore's, One very significant different is there is an adult trick eye museum beside it, only for 18+, other than that I would prefer Singapore's one, there are bigger and more. However children will love this.",
          "This was one of my dreams to see in soul. The art scene is so hard to find or originate the pieces because they always steal everything but this place is original",
          "Considering the high rating and feedback for Trickeye Museum I was definitely disappointed. Once you have paid and get in and see what it's all about, you just have to make the most of it. 30,000 won for 2 adults to walk around and take silly photos for 20 minutes was just a bit",
          "Visitors are able to express their imagination by being a photographer taking the most creative photographs or become an object of a realistic masterpiece.",
          "You will be surprise how creative you can be to have your photo taken... this doesn't apply to kids but also to granny! I can see almost every visitors will try their very best to pose for their picture to be taken... and most of the expressions are really creative!. Ice Museum",
          "It's not usually my thing to pose in this quirky kind of way, but it is pretty cool and I had a lot of fun doing it! If you're in the right company it will definitely enhance your experience.",
          "Nice gallery but few of must sees are no longer available. However, the place is well maintained and still tons of fun, specially if you are traveling with friends. Check out some discount coupons from the Korean Tourism website.",
          "It was really fun for my son. We went during a semi-busy time. Lots of photos and even people helped us take them. The ice museum comes with the package and also the carnival, however you get one game and then have to pay. They are rigged like most carnival games, so don't waste",
          "The package comes with ice museum too. Print out discount coupon that offer to the foreigners. Hongik university street is just nearby too",
          "It was interesting and fun place to spend time with children and young couple. Essentially it is a 3-D templates that was designed such that you can use your imagination to create interesting photos. You need a creative mind to see all the angles and how it will turn out on",
          "This museum has an amazing ideas for someone to take some great photos! It was a little annoying pushing through the crowd of people to get out of the subway,but once you cross the street its all clear. You get 3 attractions for 1 price. Then if you don't have the kids with you,",
          "It was fun. Spent a few hours, 1 floor, many rooms to see. Lots of interactive exhibits. Good for families or bored airman....15000 won ( $12) pretty good price. Once was enough to visit, but for families good to go back.",
          "The Trickeye Museum is pretty cool. If you are in the Hongdae area, I would definitely recommend a quick visit to the Trickeye museum. This place allows for everyone to get creative and have some fun!",
          "We went as a couple, which is fine, but it would probably be better with a group of people. There are a lot of pieces that need two people and we had to keep bothering others to help us take a picture. Good place to goof around and be silly. You go to the ice museum (complete",
          "There is something for all ages here! Great fun! Easy to find and well worth the entrance fee. Make sure to bring a good camera and plenty of memory. Children and teens will enjoy this the most.",
          "This is in the Hongdae district/neighborhood. I went with a group of friends and had a fun goofy time taking photos with the art works. Coming from a day of palaces and temples, this provided a fun night activity.",
          "It is at Hongdae (=Hongik University street) and togethet with Ice Museum. You can enjoy the funny picture which you shoot. After the photo the picture looks funny because of the illusion. Good to enjoy indoor. :)",
          "As soon as Got in the museum, you can see loads of people with big smile and laughter on their faces, definitely recommend to people who are seeking for good time!!",
          "Went here in the late evening about an hour before they closed. It was very quiet which made it easier to take the pictures we wanted to take. I would recommend a visit if you have the time and funds but not a necessary stop in Seoul.",
          "Amazing art and so fun. Best stop in Korea for some unwinding. Bring a camera and prepare for some laughs!!!",
          "Many recommended this place but I found it fairly childish. Some of the tricks are a little funny, but most are either silly , or rude, or simply boring. I ended up walking through the place fairly quickly. Not recommended.",
          "If you are in the seoul area and want a quick laugh with friends or family... this is definitely a fun place to check out sober or not!!!",
          "A good place to experiment with your photography and test your creativity. One has to invest a few minutes in order to compose a shot that will look so real when viewed on the screen.",
          "Just a joyful place with lots of to try. Don't forget to bring your camera with you. It could be adviceable to prepare for a cold...very cold experience, too...if one likes to do a visit.",
          "The name says it all, definitely bring your camera as you will become a part of the \"trick eye\" artwork. Very fun place to be, entry was 15000 won (ice museum included as well)",
          "Went to the museum alone and initially it was difficult to experience the museum without people taking photos of you as that is the main point. Luckily managed to find some people to go together with, which helped a lot. The images are very innovative and it was great fun!",
          "Great place to kill a few hours in a trendy college neighborhood. Take your camera and have some fun with the backgrounds and props. When you've had enough inside, stroll through the neighborhood shops and look for trendy, inexpensive items or duck into one of the many cafes and",
          "You should come here to break up the stress brought on by shopping, shopping, shopping which is what most tourist end up doing in Seoul. This is a fun escape that gets everyone, no matter what age, into the act. You can just take photos of recommended poses by the museum at",
          "Although I probably wouldn't visit the museum again, it was certainly a fun way to spend a couple of hours in Seoul. There's around 20 exhibits on display for you to interact with. Some are really great while others are just so-so. Your ticket will also include admission to the",
          "Was taken by my customer whilst in the area during my recent business trip to Korea, well worth the visit if you happen to be in the area!",
          "Nicely designed place not too big, lots of interesting props that you want to be pictured in. You must go in without an hang ups to enjoy, I suppose the young would enjoy very much but me at 61 together with my Wife also enjoyed it too.",
          "We found this activity hugely entertaining. For a $15 fee you walk around and take unusual and funny pics of your friends. This is not an activity for a lonely traveler. The streets around are lively with the students, shops and restaurants.",
          "Something fun to do and take pictures. They have amazing artwork \u2764 make sure to take your time to look around. They also have an Ice museum make sure you wear warm clothes as it is very cold.",

And since it requires someone to take the picture going alone is a waste of money. Also possible to buy it discounted online just Google it.\nIce museum was cool and very cold",

          "Fun place to go with friends & family! Need to download their apps once you enter ( they provide wifi) , all the photo or video you take will have 3D effect.",
          "Cool 3D drawing .especially if you download the app that the museum will let you know about. Would be kind of live .",
          "Actually this museum is kinna small. It is a big freezer. Don't forget to bring a jacket with you before you get in",
          "Heard about it but never been until trip to Korea. Some tour groups came in after us so glad that we got there earlier.  It's a lot of rooms with various artwork that tricks the eye.  Also went into their ice museum which was not worth it \u2026",
          "It was a fun experience \ud83d\ude0d",
          "One of the great place to have fun with friends in Hongdae.",
          "Fun for kids.  Download the app, take pictures and videos.  The app drains your phone's battery, so bring a backup charger.  You'll need an internet signal for the app to work in the different locations. The place is below ground level.  You can connect to their unsecured wifi.  Use a VPN.",
          "I went to trick eye museum and ice museum.\nThe museum is all about using their software app. Don't forget to download trickeye app from Google play store. They have free wifi . \nIt was not that much good as it appears to be on website. You \u2026",
          "Excellent if you come early. Plenty off opportunities to take virtual video with the app.",
          "This place was fun.  The app was giving me a lot of problems at first (I had it downloaded already and was hooked up to the wifi), not sure why but it eventually worked.  Some of the animations are funny, others are magical, and others are \u2026",
          "Use trick eye AR app to animate each scene. Adjacent ice museum to enjoy mini slide. Love museum upstairs",
          "It's a fun place in Hongdae. We recommand to download the Trick Eye Apps, it shows 3D action in the pic. It's good to come with friends and family.",
          "Nice place to visit especially with Kids or friends, not very big. But today is a little aging",
          "Unsure why there were so many positive reviews, was expensive for what it was- wasn't particularly well done and didn't take long to see everything, even with taking pictures\n\nMaybe okay with kids, but otherwise not good at all, especially \u2026",
          "The museum was enjoyable and especially perfect for an indoor activity on a rainy day. The app is a must to download as it helps you capture (via photo/video) each display as they come to life when viewed through the app. The ice museum has \u2026",
          "It was quite fun! Easy for families and fun for couples!",
          "A cool place to visit..\n\nCalling it a museum is kind of overrated. we should call it a \"3D trickeye gallery \".\n\nThere are 3 area to join: a trickeye, an ice cold place, and a 18+ collection about sex (19+ required in South Korra)\n\nIt's really fun to explore here!",
          "Very fun experience! Would go again with new company! I did not really care for the VR Phone app that they promote you using, only because you still see the painted stuff, and then a duplicate moving version overlaying it (I included a dragon pic with an example)",
          "Fun, but you really need to know how to pose and use the app. VR experience costs extra, but the Ice Experience is cool \ud83d\ude00",
          "So much fun that I've been multiple times .",
          "Very instagram friendly. The AR didn\u2019t work for me but it did for others. Absolutely incredible experience and loved it.",
          "Excellent place to have more fun in this museum . Love museum is also near it . I suggest everyone to visit this place atleast once .It will be more funny if a group of people visit together . That VR & AR effects are awesome. All are \u2026",
          "This place was fun!! I recommend 2 or more people to go in order to take cool pictures! The AR app is a must download! Makes everything so lively!",
          "Awesome. Mind blown by the app to make the pictures not only 3D, but literally ALIVE. Kids would definitely love this place. Highly recommended.",
          "Great experience to enjoy with friends and family. Definitely a must if you're visiting Seoul. Make sure to bring your phone cause you'll be missing a lot of the fun otherwise. There's an app that you can download at the museum to make the experience even more fun. Totally recommended.",
          "Some funny scenes to take pictures in. Definitely load down the AR app as it adds another dimension to the videos and photos. Smaller than some similar places we went to. Ice museum is not that exciting.",
          "A fun place to take interesting pictures. You need to have someone with you to take pics. Their ice room is fun (there's a slide!) But be sure to dress warmly for it or that portion won't be enjoyable",
          "Love this place. So cool",
          "Slightly expensive, but if you like taking optical illusion pics, this is the place for you. Great for couples actually. The ticket comes with a trip to the ice museum so be sure to bring a jacket that you can throw on so you don't freeze to death",
          "We had a terrific time as a family. Lots of fun and laughter.",
          "Quite funny and only usable with the app. Effects will get old but are good quality.",
          "This is the most original and fun place I have ever been to. A place where you can photograph yourself with real 3D visual illusions such as dragons eating you. Definitely worth the visit and it's really good value the entrance is about \u00a312. Definitely the first place I would go to in Seoul",
          "Personally, I don't think it's worth it if you're visiting internationally unless you're there for a few months or years and have \"been there, done that.\" Precious travel time could be def spent elsewhere that's more cultural. It's good to kill time otherwise and if you've never been to sort of place?",
          "Good for one time experience. It's more enjoyable for the Kids than adults.\nNote: Above statement is true only for the trick eye and Ice Museum and not for the Love Museum which is one level above these. Incase of Love Museum, it's Vice Versa.",
          "This place is actually great fun especially if you buy the full pass, you get to go to the ice museum and the VR ride.",
          "Very cool place to check out while in Korea, I would highly recommend going to hongdae. This place is really fun as it has much more of a younger crowd, people speak better English in this area as well.",
          "Bery nice place i been here..haha have a fun",
          "It's a fun experience! You'll get some fun photo shots and if you were lucky like me it isn't crowded so you have enough time \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Scam\n\nYou gotta pay 17 000 won to do the VR experience, ice \"museum\" and the trick eye exhibition.\n\nWhen you want to do the VR, you have to choose 1 from 7 VR games and that's it for your money. Nobody told you that. So you're paying \u2026",
          "Had a great time at this museum. Great location, easy to find. A ticket gives you access to the TrickEye museum and the ice museum; featuring ice sculptures, including a slide in a freezing room, I dare you to stay longer than 10 minutes. \u2026",
          "It\u2019s really had a lot of fun in here. You can use the app to take the 4D photos with your friends.And it\u2019s one of my favorite place in Seoul, hope can come again in the future.",
          "Very fun experience and u can download the trickeye AR app for fun come-alive effects!!",
          "Place is a lot of fun and good price for the multiple museums you get. Bring a jacket for the ice museum as it is pretty chilly.  Lots of great pictures captured.",
          "Super fun way to take pictutes. Nice rainy day place or a place to get out of the super hot, cold, or polluted air. I went years ago but now they add an app that adds cool stuff to your pix",
          "This was SO FUN! We had such a blast! Every nook and cranny were filled with pictures and photo opportunities. We couldn't stop laughing and smiling. The price was great for what was available to us. I would DEFINITELY go back.",
          "Awesome place to take some pictures .",
          "The Trickeye Museum is the fantastic place for visiting in Seoul. When I had visited with my friends, we enjoyed to much because we did not think such a beautiful place before visit. I would like to recommend to all for visiting!",
          "Wonderful place to spend a couple of hours. The app is a must download. Really enjoyed!",
          "Fun place to visit for everyone~ \nstrongly recommend to download the app for taking photo or video",
          "Fun experience if you have time. Must get the app to fully experience, it's not as fun without the VR",
          "It is a great. I was have fun with my friends.Using the apps can take the 3D video which the picture is look like alive. It was very funny to take the photo and video. There are ice museum which is very beautiful. I played on the ice slice many times. It was fast and  exciting .",
          "We had a group laugh way back in Korea n we enjoyed the fun.i kept And loved elfie with aagitarius with me",
          "This place was amazing! Definitly a place to take the family!",
          "I had a good time at this place, it was pretty fun. There were plenty of illusions, but towards the end of it, they got pretty repetitive. But worth a visit for a few funny photos.\nBe sure to bring a jacket or warm clothing to enter the ice museum, it was -4\u00b0C",
          "Best place to have fun with friends, couple, family. You can use their creative app which gives super affects tonyour pics and videos. I wouldn't recommend to go there alone so that your partner can take cool photos of you",
          "Very Amazing! !!take wonderful photossss there!",
          "Cool place to visit if you are in the area and have some time to burn. Took some great selfies here.",
          "I went to the trick eye museum and had so much fun with my boyfriend! It was such a good date place and we took so many fun pictures. It will also be really fun to go there with your family!",
          "Highly recommend 2 or more people",
          "It was worth 15.000 won. I've in Korea on and off for over 6 years, this was my first trip! I'm happy I went!",
          "This place was more fun than I originally thought!! The AR app really makes everything more realistic! Definitely recommend everyone to go!!",
          "it was a brand new experience with trickeye app. you can take photos or videos with the app. Also there is a new corner with a supermoon. it would be great to take many photos. i think many people will like it.",
          "Good Museum. We had a great time there.",
          "A good place to go with your friends or families. You will have a lot of fun there and see something amazing. Especially ice museum, you can try in summer.",
          "Good indoor activity but can be a little cramped with all the people trying go take photos. The AR app adds another element of fun. Lots of crossover /similar displays as the Sentosa, Singapore Trick Eye Museum so be aware of that if you have been previously.",
          "Well I didn't know what to expect but it didn't half suprise me. Whoever thought of this was brilliant, its just magic.",
          "It is not a very big place as i expected \ud83d\ude05 the area is so tight and if you take a picture you have to go faster because there's a lot of people waiting on you.. and the required apps is loading very slow if ur using their wifi specially \u2026",
          "Nice place if you like to take loads of photos",
          "Had a fun night with my friend! Good location - it's right in the middle of the busy streets of Hongdae so we stopped by on a Friday night before dinner and drinks. We downloaded the AR app and enjoyed the 3D effects, took silly pictures of ourselves! Enjoyed the Ice Museum as well.",
          "Second time that I've been here, and they've improved the place! Apart from the photo spots that is the trademark of Trickeye, they now have an augmented reality app that you can download to your phone that allows you to take photos with AR \u2026",
          "For best effect download the app and then pose and take photos all the way round. It's an AR exhibition rather than traditional optical illusions. Good fun. Take a coat for the ice museum, as not surprisingly it's freezing!",
          "This is a museum which you can check out the AR effect by using a dedicated APP! Don't miss it!!!! Btw the moon is so fantastic!! =)",
          "With the AR application they provide, you get to see a lot of AR effects and illusions. It's definitely a good place to play around with your friends and family! If you're still looking for something to play around Hongdae, definitely check this out!",
          "Very good experience with 3D effect. Enjoy very much. And the ice museum super cool",
          "Trickeye museum is fun, but when you use their app it's amazing. The exhibits come to life for photos and videos.",
          "There are two versions; one is an adult trickeye museum and the other is lets say family friendly. and I am so happy that I didn't miss it on my last day in seoul. it is a must see attraction.",
          "We had really fun time here and recommend to the traveler who haven't been here yet. Don't forget to download there special app named 'trickeye,' you will have more fun here like us. \n\u8d85\u7d1a\u5927\u63a8\u85a6!!!",
          "Diffferent from anything we have seen",
          "The museum is surprisingly amazing. Plz download and install their app so tht u could view and capture all the animation and cgi on ur phone. I have spent almost 3 hrs in the museum to take video and photo on each sections until my phone \u2026",
          "Awesome afternoon activity. Took my daughter and had a blast!",
          "Actually surprising, not expecting much of it but ended up having a blast. Most down load the app to see the special effects of your pictures. Friends and family where in press with all of the special effects and trick pictures. Good place \u2026",
          "IS a trick! for your eyes! A lot of stuff to see there.. best for the families or couples. You can spend couple of hours there to have fun. VR section is for me the most recommended.",
          "Very nice place",
          "Interactive and time well spent.",
          "We need this special effects in the real world! The TrickEye Museum gives you an awesome opportunity to see the world through your phone with different eyes. We had a really nice time there and enjoyed the crazy effects.",
          "I wouldn't call it a museum. Doesn't worth 15,000 Won per person ...",
          "Just go and try! I don't have anything else to say.",
          "For me is just standard nothing special.",
          "It's a cool place. You can get some really weird pictures. And it doesn't too long either",
          "Omg, this place was so much fun and so creative. Whoever came up with this is genius. We went through the course and wished we didn't come out because you cannot re-enter. There is an app that allows you to see, take photos and videos with 3D  animation. I recommend !",
          "not very fun. specially love museum. so weird",
          "Amazing! The museum and the app was very well made. AR animations are super cool and very fun. Highly recommend to attend with a minimum of 3-4 people because many of the pictures look better with more people in them. It is a good price and there are a large variety of different pictures to take.",
          "Good one. But the place is not located on a proper place. The road is little narrow and I didn't see any parking there. You need to install trickeye App on your smart phone. Ticketing will cost you around 25k won. Inside you will get some \u2026",
          "Simply amazing specially if you use their app. Really nice",
          "Just okayish. Is for someone who never went to anything similar before",
          "It is a nice place to visit. But the trick eye app drains the battery exponentially. So do carry an external battery charger when you visit. Mine dropped from 89% to 15% in 30 mins using that app continuously on my One Plus 3T.",
          "Kind of disappointing, since to get the real experience you need to be staring at your phone all the time. The most fun part is taking pictures of friends with the various optical illusion, so not a good choice if you're by yourself. Ice museum - yeah, that's pretty bad, not worth your time at all.",
          "Amazing experience for the weekend. My friend and I had a lot of photos in museums of trickeye, ice and love. The best one should be Ice museum with the ice castle and ice living room.",
          "A mesmerizing view for your eyes. A good place for people who likes to take photos. You can go with your friends or family. Don't go their alone. Ice museum is very cold. You will get tickets for both and the rate is like 15000\u20a9 you can pay by cash or card. It is a must visit place if you're visiting Seoul.",
          "Unique experience alternative in seoul",
          "Highly recommend if you are in the hongdae area",
          "Its okay, not more then this. The photo and the tricks are very nice but there are pictures that dont need animeshen and still they have. That anoin.",
          "Had an amazing time looking at the art as well as being in it. Great time, bring friends.",
          "A fun way to spend an hour or two. You will need to use their AR app to make the most of the attractions and take the cool photos. They have free wifi which you can use to download the app once you are there.",
          "The tickets here was included in the Discover Seoul Pass. We had entrance to the ice display as well as the museum.\nThe ice museum was in a giant freezer and had carvings of different things like a throne or a bear. They also had a huge \u2026",
          "I had a good time with my friend when we visited! I could finally fulfil my dream as a ballerina on stage so yeah, that\u2019s my favourite display. The others were cool too and we had lots of fun posing at different angles.",
          "You have to pay extra for some VR games but it's fun going through with some friends.",
          "Astonishing experience and well-created museum! They combined new technologies with art and it looks super excellent! Highly recommend it, and thankful for creating this museum!",
          "Very and interesting. A must try if your in Hongdae. The ice museum also has a slide made of ice.There is also a VR game room",
          "It's definitely a fun place to go to if you've never been especially with children or older adults like my mom! Now the museum is even more interactive with an app that animates the paintings or pictures so that you can get a video on top of photos of these scenarios.",
          "Entertaining place to spend time with family and friends. Parking in and around the area is difficult and costly",
          "Great location for tourists. Takes about two hours to go through if you're taking photos.",
          "AR app is the best. Making the 3D even more real and beautiful",
          "Nice place for pictures. Must note on seoul visit checklist. Use tranzy for 3k won discount. Ice museum is verygood.",
          "I would like to tell everyone who is willing to visit this museum, it's really worth going. I visited twice with my girlfriend and we both loved it. It's creative and funny at the same time.",
          "It is an interesting place to visit",
          "Unless you are here to take the funny and creative shots, it is not worth going.",
          "Such a fun place to visit! I went there with my bf and we had just tons of laughter! we enjoyed the Trick Eye Museum new 3D experience with the app and really loved how it made everything more real! We also experienced the Ice Museum (loved \u2026",
          "There a lot Trickeye Museum around the world. This is much similar or same with those in Asia region. Probably due to under the same company. Can visit if time permits and you haven't visit one.",
          "Super fun and a great way to spend a few hours in Seoul!  Come prepared with a fully charged phone! You\u2019re gonna need it!",
          "Had good time visiting here. Remember to bring a power bank with you, that your phone battery won\u2019t last long enough \ud83e\udd23\nAlso, you should bring a sweater with you, that you will need it while playing in the ice museum. \n\n\u8bb0\u5f97\u5e26\u51b2\u7535\u554a - \u4e00\u4e0b\u5b50\u5c31\u6ca1\u6709\u7535\u5566\n\u6700\u597d\u5e36\u4e0a\u5916\u5957\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728 ice museum \u7559\u4e45\u4e00\u9ede\u3002",
          "Funny little place to check out once. Admission gets you into the trick eye museum and an entry into the ice area. The trick eye museum has a AR (augmented reality) feature if you use their app. Some places it is nice but other spots it is \u2026",
          "This is a whole heap of fun. Ensure your phone is fully charged and you can download the app. No app no fun to be had",
          "The museum is very cool especially if you go with friends. There is an application you can download that helps you take wonderful pictures and videos. You should definitely visit this place",
          "If you like crowds of tourists with their kids screwing up your shots and waiting forever (10-15mins each shot) just to take a decent photo, then for sure come to this place.\nWill cost you 18,000 won per adult which will give u entry for \u2026",
          "Amazingly fun museum! Just enough weird and hilarious pictures to pose alongside, and filled with friendly and accommodating staff. \n\nOnly speaking English wasn't an issue, the staff was all about to communicate very well with us!",
          "Fun picture place. Great conceptual art and visuals. Definitely fun for a group or a date.",
          "I went with my girlfriend and we had the most amazing time at this Trick Eye Museum. Especially the App how it allowed us to take photos with special visual effect background. It was just astonishing. Thank you so much for the best experience",
          "One of the topmost things to do in Seoul. Loved every second spent here in the Trickeye Museum.",
          "Not worth your money, it is disastrous ,you can find it in science museums",
          "Cool and unexpected place! It's definitely fun and full of surprised. Recommended! Although for the ice room please bring a jacket and wear jeans, it's literally a freezer.",
          "Its a great place, especially if you like photography. This place has an AR museum as well, where still images come to life and you be a part of it!",
          "It's a AR museum. It's nice. One time enjoyment. It consists of 3 museums. Trickeye + ice + love. When you buy ticket , it's only for ice and trickeye. For love museum, you have to buy ticket separately. The ticket price for trickeye is \u2026",
          "Besides the app killing my battery, it was fun.",
          "This is fun. A clever idea really well done.\nIt doesn't take long to go through everything, but it's worth it.\nMostly for the younger crowd, early teens I reckon.",
          "Really cool, kids loved it. Ice Museum was neat also.",
          "Special effects made our visit unforgettable",
          "The trickeye museum is a great place to go with friends and take funny photos. If you are creative and like photography, it's a good place to spend loads of time. Some exhibits have interesting lighting while others come with great AR effects that come with the app.",
          "This is a great place to take pictures with friends and family!  Lots of fun and interesting photo opportunities to use on your social media apps.  This is my second time visiting and it's a lot less crowded in the winter and during the \u2026",
          "Very interactive museum that let's you take funny pictures with optical illusions. There is also an app that adds VR effects to your photos/videos. We had a lot of fun here!",
          "A good place showing part of Korean civilization",
          "Pretty expensive for what you get, \u20a915,000 per adult which was a little unexpected. But it was a lot of fun and the pictures and videos you get are hilarious! You should download the app using their wifi bc it has the augmented reality features which were sweet. All in all not a bad $15",
          "Everyone enjoy coming here ... from young to old alike.",
          "Just ok..dont go in if there is a lot of people coz difficult to take picture",
          "Tourist trap but somewhat fun. Don't make this the only item on your list, though. You will be done in under 10 minutes.",
          "I don't really understand what people see in this museum. Most of the exhibits require the use of the augmented reality app on your smartphone, which you could achieve with similar AR apps you can find on Google Play. If you do visit, make sure to visit with someone who loves taking selfies as this is really the main attraction.",
          "This trickeye and ice museum was super enjoyable .me and my son really really enjoyed and liked it. This is a recommendable place.really loved it. Want to go again.",
          "Oh~~. Fun museum!!  Friends and kids would love the place.  Specially this summer vacation must go place.  Take lots of photos and we'll keep laughing everytime you see them.",
          "A fun placed worth to visit with AR element integrated to a modern museum. Though not very big, we still can spend a couple of hours if you like taking photo. Special effects can be integrated in your video taking as well..",
          "Had a blast! Lots of different things to interact with. The app didn't play nice right away, but started working and really adds something to each art piece. A few of the 3d projections prevent the AR from working correctly. As they warn, bring a battery because this will suck the juice out of your phone.",
          "The trick eye museum has an app that brings the art  to live. Highly recommend that you use it. There is also an ice museum there.",
          "It is a good place where you can take lots of interesting photos and with their own application called trickeye and the considerate indications, you can see more incredible effects.",
          "I was expecting a little more from the place, especially since it was reviewed best museum in Seoul on TripAdvisor. The ice sculptures were cool, though. But the rest was O.K. In my opinion it's definitely not a must do if you're in Seoul.",
          "Fun and interesting AR museum with special effects. My kids really enjoyed it and it was a very good experience.\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17",
          "Surprisingly entertaining. The photos came out very well.",
          "the place is nice, there are 3 kind of museum in there, one of it is the trick eye museum. I am using discovery seoul pass so I didn't remember the price but as usual in korea there are several package that you can choose. We would need to have phone to download the trick eye camera and there are free wifi that we can use",
          "Great. Been there for 2 times and it's still awesome",
          "Great place very funny \ud83d\ude04 I enjoined a lot with my kid it\u2019s an awesome idea. Tips. You have to download the official app in order to enjoy more. For the same price, you can enter to the ice museum which is great too. Sculptures and slides made of ice very funny!",
          "Nice place to hangout with friends to have some fun...its good if you install trickeye app before taking pictures to get some 3d effects",
          "It's kind of fun I guess",
          "Make sure download the app first.  More fun by using the app to take videos and photos.  You can preview the special effect before taking pictures.",
          "A realy nice place.",
          "It was great, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was basically a place to take cool photos of yourself.",
          "Trickeye is fun for the whole family!",
          "Very good, but don't go alone like me!!",
          "It's somewhat fun, but don't plan this as your only excursion. You won't need more than 20 minutes to experience the whole place.",
          "Super fun and funny place. Tons of pictures were taken.",
          "Kids had a lot of fun. Totally cheesy but somewhat interesting and fun too!\nI tried the arcade car racing at the end and felt queezy for an hour after!",
          "The augmented reality was a really neat feature but it felt less interactive then the static paintings that you can pretend to hold or sit or be in.",
          "Good fun with children and the family for a couple of hours",
          "I really love spending my time here to see and capture some funny moments with the props and application that was given by the staff. The 3D effects are so cool though! Would like to visit again if I have a chance :D",
          "It was a great experience.. photos came out good.. it is a bit difficult to take pics, if it gets crowded..",
          "Was fun but it's not a must see ^ ^",
          "Little but wonderful place to take your time",
          "it was a great and fun place to visit with family. my kids enjoyed it very much.",
          "The musuem is okay and shows its age. There is also an app to take VR pictures but the app is very slow. There is also an ice room and we found it to be more fun.",
          "Very unique nice experience; make sure to download their app to take pics with effects ^^",
          "Interesting place, good for a younger crowd or those young at heart. Seems like it originally had exhibits with forced perspective and added an augmented reality app later. A ticket also gets you into the ice museum.",
          "Fun thing to do!",
          "Highly recommended for couples and friends. The place is full of fun activities. Specially for love birds you should pass by Love museum. Ice and trick eye museum is a must watch in there for everybody.",
          "Fantastic place to visit.",
          "To feel the enjoyment completely must use their mobile application.",
          "So fun . Awesome",
          "This place is kind of expensive, but it is super fun. It's a great place to check out if you want a good laugh.",
          "It was really funny to go there with my friends and you'll be able to take some great pictures and videos home! I have never visited such a museum before with using modern technology as good as they did!",
          "This is a very unique museum. The whole museum theme is based on illusions which trick and deceive the eye using Augmented reality. It has both 3d/2d illusions. It us a must watch if anyone happens to be in seoul. It is going to be fun for \u2026",
          "This place definitely made our day somewhat special.  The place was loaded with many visitors but you are still able to be in all the frames. However, I think I got bored faster than I thought and I was kind of breezing through to be done \u2026",
          "It was great fun, but I was expecting more. You must unstall the Trickeye Museum camera, which allows you to get the most out of your experience. Make sure you have 1. A good camera 2. A tripod or the similar 3. Creativity. \nOtherwise, it was actually a very interesting experience~",
          "I truly relished the scenes where my life seemed to be in danger - surrounded by sea monsters, snakes, ancient predators. But the best illusion is created by the space turned around 90 degrees, where you can defy gravity and make matrix poses :)",
          "Fun to do on a rainy day",
          "This is a lot of fun, highly recommended",
          "Its a wonderful experience, you can try their AR experience by downloding apps, they also provide free wifi inside the muzeum...cool, if you have chance,this is another place i recommend\ud83d\ude01",
          "Interesting place.",
          "Much much better than my expectation. Consider coming again",
          "It was a reli fun experience... I love how we can take funny photos or videos with the Trick eye app...!!!",
          "Existing & very much enjoy many magic pictures",
          "Interesting pictures, statues, and playgrounds and marm condition for cold weather",
          "Super dope place! The tricks are sooooooo real. It\u2019s not too crowded and the location is easy to find. A must visit site when visiting Korea.",
          "Very intersting place and you can experience 4D effect in this muzeum using their apps in AR, also the muzeum have free wifi...cool",
          "worth to see , AR apps support, funny",
          "Lot's of great opportunity for photos. I loved all the trick shots. The price was very reasonable as well. The ice museum ticket came with the cost of the trick eye museum. My date froze inside of 10 seconds in the door, it was really cold \u2026",
          "I am glad me and my friends decided to go to this place! The staff was very friendly and I found very useful the fact that we had everywhere instructions on how we should take the best picture. The Ice Museum was really nice, but my \u2026",
          "Fun place to kill some time in Seoul. Many funny pictures to be taken for your social media accounts here.",
          "The illusions are amazing and there are a lot of spots to take awesome pictures. I really liked an app TrickEye that makes pictures \u201cmove\u201d and you can make videos with effects. This place is definitely worth visiting!",
          "Very amazing and enjoyable museum in Seoul. I recommend the visitors of Seoul to visit at least once to the museum",
          "Same with the name, the drawings in the museum are tricky, but then interesting. I can\u2019t stop taking pictures inside the museum, especially for the 3D Effects.. I could post it on my Instastory and Share my good moments with my friends :D",
          "Its a great spot to visit. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting or living in Sout Korea. It well worth the trip for both young and old but it can be a little hard to visit alone but you can alway ask staff to take your picture, if need \u2026",
          "It is not really fun in there. Ice sculptures are not well made. It took like 3 minutes to explore the whole room. Trickeye museum is better, but still nothing special. Expectation was higher but its good to kill half an hour during shopping in hongdae.",
          "I could take many fun and interesting photo. The AR effect was interesting too. I recommend to everyone who visit seoul and also who live in seoul.",
          "Worth a visit. The virtual reality experience is an eye-opener, but I reckon the novelty factor is good for just one go.",
          "Mostly a place where you take photos, not see optical illusions. You can get some cool shots, but nothing huge.",
          "Quite small, expensive entrance fee for its content. Wasn't that impressive. Still an attraction to see if you're in the area.",
          "If you like taking pics, you must visit it.",
          "Nice. Enjoyed it!",
          "Check this place out. Never been anywhere like it before. Cool experience.",
          "Loads of fun and laughs. An experience you should definitely try. Parking a bit difficult in the area",
          "Very different and entertaining museum be sure to bring your phone and an extra charge cause you are gonna drain your battery there",
          "Fun for half an hour, maybe less, and really much too expensive!",
          "So apparently the Trickeye Museum is  a whole AR paradise. You got the trickeye app that brings everything to life AND the themes change everyone. Then there is the ice museum, love museum and trick adventure?? \nWell there were no complaints this time",
          "Really fun place with great use of of technology",
          "Hillarious. Test your creative pose here...",
          "Really fun and interesting. Use the app!",
          "I don\u2019t understand why this place is a must go place in Seoul... it\u2019s kinda cool the first time you try the VR, but lame after a while. The trick eye stuff is fun for the first or second but not worth it. Good to go for entertaining kids maybe but not a good place for adults",
          "Make sure you go with a group or something because there's no one to take pics for you. It's fun-ish though. I would say it's worth the money.",
          "I loved visiting this place with my friends! We had such a good time and the photos we took there are just hilarious! Highly recommended :)",
          "Just not my thing. Staff were helpful. App was impressive. Would be good for kids, tweens and people with a mild instagram obsession.",
          "Very fun place if better if you go with somebody to take funny videos",
          "Enjoyed the experience.",
          "I enjoyed taking our daughter here, but it's not a place I would chose to go to. This may be a good stop if you have to spend a day indoors and you have an extra couple of hours.",
          "Would be a good date place. Gets a bit repetitive after the first couple of rooms. Ice section was not for me",
          "Cool and fun place to go with friends. \n\nThey\u2019ve got a ice museum too which was freezing",
          "Funny and exited haha.",
          "Mini treasure near Hongik University in Seoul. Great place to take silly pictures",
          "TrickEye! Animation in  your smartphone.",
          "This was really a great experience to take some exciting and funny photos with friends in this 3D Trickeye Museum. All the pictures and models were so funny and realistic.!!^^",
          "Lots of fun. Great sets and their app ads a nice touch to some of the photos. Definitely check it out.",
          "It was a good decision to visit this place on a weekend . loved the witty atmosphere and recommend others to visit this at least once.",
          "This museum is basically just for selfies, the app makes it a little bit more exciting but besides that it is just wall art. Not what I was expecting.",
          "Fun place to visit especially with kids",
          "Place totally worth to visit. It's absolutely different from cultural activities in Seoul. Quite interactive, you will enjoy taking funny pictures with your friends!",
          "It is fun and exciting place to visit. Located right in the heart of the busy area, Hongdae. Pass through the Trickeye Museum, Love Museum, and Ice Museum for a fun experience on a weekend or any day. Make sure you charge your battery or \u2026",
          "This museum is one of the best places that I've ever been to in Seoul. The price of the ticket is also affordable. A good place to hang around with friends and just have good laugh for the whole day!",
          "It is a very interesting place to visit and the 3D effect will totally blow your mind, trust me and do not forget to download the Trickeye app, and enjoy the trip!!! P.S. the pics I took become a total hit among my friends haha",
          "Even if you're not at the \"Love Museum\" level yet, this is a great place to come with a significant other. Ideally, come on a double date, so you can take pictures of each other together in the many interesting displays. Make sure to charge your phone first! ^_^",
          "I enjoy to enterance this place, a lot of idea i got from here",
          "Took some time to get the hang of it but it\u2019s pretty fun. Need to download their app to get the full effect for photos and videos. It was very crowded and will help with pictures if you are by yourself. Ice museum is neat too but need your jacket. They have lockers but you can only unlock it once without having to pay for it again.",
          "Nice photos you get. Great place to be",
          "Was lots of fun with a group of 3, any less would be tricky because there. Are a lot of pairs activities and you need someone to take your picture.",
          "It's a little pricey for what it is but it's almost of fun. Especially if you go as a group or on a date.",
          "I would laugh a long time at the pictures that I took in the trickeye museum. I loved the idea of the AR photos and that you can have fun during you make so many memories. Along with my friends this was one of the best experiences in Korea so far.",
          "It's cool, So funny, Beautiful art 3D interactive",
          "cool place to visit. very good for family but the ice museum was very very cold. download the trickeye museum app first.",
          "Want to enjoy and visit 3 museums in one place? Than come to trickeye! Cause there you can also visit ice and love museums\ud83d\ude44 Making a lot of pictures, having fun with your friends and enjoying your trip))",
          "VERY RECOMMENDABLE. Extremely happy that my friends and me decided to go to the museum Sometimes you just imagine Hongdae is just about getting a lot of food and wasted. But these kinds of attractions give a healthy, family/couple/friend-oriented attraction while providing memories for you and your acquaintances.",
          "It was cute, pretty affordable and an interesting place to visit if you have the time.",
          "This place is part of the 21 spots you can avail for free using the Discover Seoul Pass with Pyeongchang in 2018. This is the first trick eye museum I have gone into so I don\u2019t have comparison. But we enjoyed it. I\u2019ve completed the tour inside the museum with my mom.",
          "It was so much fun!!! Would recommend this place to my friends...",
          "It is so fun to take pics",
          "All those cool optical illusions in one place. It's a lot of fun and the VR app adds a nice touch. The interactive ones are the best. The illusions can use some paint  touchups and minor repairs, since a lot of traffic comes thru. Also got \u2026",
          "Quite a bit of fun. Right in the middle of a neat shopping area.",
          "I am glad I took some time out to visit this museum. Amongst the three museums located in the same place, Trickeye Museum is my favorite. What really surprised me was that the when you look at the art with a naked eye or with any camera, \u2026",
          "Fun and quick attraction.  Great to do while visiting the popular Hongik University neighborhood.  Good for all ages.  Best with friends. Come with fully charged phone.",
          "We had a lot of fun",
          "Total tourist trap. If you feel like wasting time in an Instagram photo booth, feel free. I think I could have spent my time better elsewhere.",
          "Trick eye museum was nice experience. Few great innovations. Not very big though. I think one hour vitsit was more than enough. Not very far from subway station, but no signs or anything to get right directions. Staff was`t very helpful ot friendly. Ticket price was approximately 12\u20ac/person.",
          "Trickeye museum is a an amazing place to hang out. The trickeye app made our experience even more amazing. Special tip:  the museum is fun no matter what age you are! :)",
          "Interesting way to fill an afternoon, though not as good as other trick art places I've seen. Some of the illusions didn't make sense, lacked context, or were not set up properly. The 'love museum' upstairs was good if you like low-brow dick jokes (we did).",
          "Hard to get the right angle and a quite crowded! but i went with a friend on Saturday around 5 to 6pm",
          "It was a pretty intriguing exhibit.  It would be awesome if you download the Trick Eye App, as the app shows you not just the 3D part, but also 3D action.  You can take photos or videos.",
          "Have fun with the kiddies and old farts!",
          "Great place to take pictures. Easy also to locate from the Hongdae subway station. Overall, I had a great experience!",
          "Great for groupd that want to take tons of funny photos!",
          "I went with a friend and laughed the whole way in and out, the AR illusions were great or making silly and funny videos. The whole experience was way better than i expected and also a great scape from the cold. recommend.",
          "Great experience. Had some difficulty finding the location but it was such a fun experience. Great for groups. Not for singles because you need someone to take your photos.",
          "Good Recommendation to visit here with your family and play game with your Children. You will have some amazing picture moments after go here. Try!",
          "very nice place that you should visit once you come to Korea",
          "Good Recommendation to visit play game with your Children. You will  have some amazing picture moments after go here. Try!",
          "One of the best tourist attraction. Trickeye Museum Hongik ro st in Hongdae",
          "It's OK... Great for funny, interesting photo moments.",
          "The Place consists of three separate museums, 1) Trickeye museum 2) Ice museum and 3) Love museum. All of them are good but The Ice museum is a must visit place, especially if you have Children.",
          "Great place! Me and my friend had a lot of fun taking pictures there! Definitely check it out. :)",
          "Very innovative museum, never seen  anything like this.  Bring your well charged smart phone, and be ready for augmented reality(AR) magic",
          "This is a wonderful place you must go when you visit seoul. I cant tell you how interesting it is if you not try it by yourself~",
          "A lot of fun fphoto opportunities!!^^~~",
          "Very nice, joyful, tricky place. Never thought of this type of ithuta type of illusion type items to explore, real joy, very funny, must visit items.",
          "It's kind of cool, you need a smartphone to download an app to take the agumented reality photos with. Bring a friend that can take pictures of you. Takes maybe 40 minutes to go through depending on how many people there are and how fast you take pictures.",
          "I have seen trickart before. What I enjoyed was the augmented reality part of it!!!",
          "Interesting love museum for adult and wear enough clothes for the ice museum as there no extra clothes will be provided. They do provide charged locker for storing the backpack sized luggage.",
          "Nice place to spent some time with friends/group..",
          "Trick eye museum is meh, no helpers to take photos, unlike in Batam. However ice museum is a must visit in Seoul. Minus 5 degrees, everything made of ice. come after 5pm no crowd",
          "Many pictures already worn out, they need repainting for some favourite spot",
          "Fun place to spend some time and take funny photos. When we went it was so crowded you have to wait a while to take each photo. FYI there are some topless statues. The ice museum is very cold sl make sure you have your jacket on before you enter.",
          "It's fun been here to see different 4D images.",
          "This is a fun experience to do with friends. Definitely go early so you're not waiting in line to take pictures and you can take crazier pics. It's literally a series of photo-ops but it's fun to do something silly. This is great for families and kids.",
          "It will be fun if you go with you friends!! Go and find it out!!",
          "Truly a gem. If you don't crack a smile for any of the photo opportunities then the ice room should get you. It's impossible not to have fun here.",
          "Not worth your time....",
          "I had a great experience here\nThe art were amazing. You should be very creative to have bunch of interesting photos ^^",
          "They have 3D pictures when you used their apps.. Amazing :)",
          "Awesome place to take pics and it's very special for couples",
          "This place was better than I expected! Went there with my wife and took loads of photos. Had such a good time here. There are at least 4 different things to choose from or you can try them all. Has lockers downstairs to keep your bags and other stuff while going around. Everyone should give it a go :)",
          "Loved this place. It was so fun, and you could easily spend a whole day here. There's actually a few different 'museums' all in the same building--trickery, ice, and love museums. They're all lots of fun. Be sure to take your camera with you!",
          "Long standing attraction in Seoul, conveniently located in the middle of Hongdae, so why not drop by for some quirky and fun photos? There is also an ice museum inside, but be prepared as it is maintained at 5\u00b0C.",
          "This was a lot of fun.  Definitely a family friendly activity, very interactive and they have an app that makes the Artwork come to life.",
          "very cool",
          "I'd r commend this place higher if it we're less crowded. There are many great trick eye spots for cameras. However, many of the photo point markers are either wore out or gone entirely making some shots more difficult. Other than that, it \u2026",
          "Seoul's Trickeye museum is a must visit! I had my doubts at first as I did not believe the quality of pictures would be great. However, I was wrong not only are the pictures great it leads to some very entertaining videos between friends!! \u2026",
          "Not the museum you might be thinking of. More like a series of photo ops to show to your friends and family from the trip then anything else. Still, not a bad sight to see if you have time in Korea.",
          "Good art with attractive 3D application.",
          "Cool place for someone who loves taking pictures!",
          "This was a lot of fun and really cool. I would recommend this museum to anyone visiting.",
          "Really fun experience",
          "Had a really fun and amusing afternoon at this place, the VR made the visit even better. In thismuseum you can pose and touch everything ( youhou) and it\u2019s even recommended ! If you want to spend a great time with your partner or your \u2026",
          "It is so hard that finding place. And original price is not reasonable and expensive.",
          "This place is really nice. You could have a bunch of fun with your friends, couple and/or family. I only had a single problem during my experience, I run out of power for more pictures hahaha don't forget to prepare your camera ;)",
          "Not bad",
          "Oh it was so much fun!",
          "Thought this place would only be appealing to the selfie obsessed, but the fam and I had a pretty good time here. Obviously lots of funky photo opportunities throughout the place, but they also have this enormous ice room where everything \u2026",
          "Trickeye Museum,,, so we must know how to take picture at the right angle for the best result.",
          "Very entertaining",
          "Expect to use your cell phone to actually experience the \"museum\". Nothing tricky here. Just cell phone trickery.",
          "A lot of fun by taking photos and video with the app.",
          "Was really fun! Bedt to go with someone else to take pictures and enjoy it fully~",
          "Trickyoureye",
          "I had so much fun visiting the museum for the second time already, and the new Trickeye app for AR pictures and videos made our experience even more exciting!",
          "Fun place and the app to take pic/vids is fun but drains your battery like it's a mukbang show. Skip the ice room.",
          "Great for taking photos although the high amount of visitors can make this a challange. Would recommend for anyone visiting Hongdae.",
          "Fun interactive museum that is definitely a must see in Korea. It was a little on the expensive side and definitely is getting around the time where it needs to be maintainenced but all in all lots of fun.",
          "A nice place to go take pictures, a special love edition for couples over 21 is a must with funny sex scenery to take pictures. The museum is pretty used thought and you can see where over millions of people have put their head and stickers telling you where to see the illusion worn off.",
          "I've been in Korea 4 months now and this is by far my favorite thing I have done so far! Made for a wonderful afternoon and many great laughs. Be equipped with a camera because you'll want to take a ton of photos. Love Museum is right upstairs as well and discount is offered if you purchase a ticket for both on the same day!",
          "We went on a weekday evening so it wasn\u2019t crowded at all. Bring a friend or two to take pictures, it\u2019s fun if you get silly with it. It\u2019s a small museum with the ice museum attached so we didn\u2019t spend too much time here but enjoyed it nonetheless!",
          "Nice fan museum to visit while in Seoul.",
          "Really cool experience, especially liked the trickeye museum, but the ice museum is quite nice too! The David fighting game was especially fun, the whole place takes around 2 hours to go around, and its a really entertaining experience!",
          "The paintings were great especially if you downloaded the trick eye app. Pictures did some amazing things.",
          "Well cool, but I think there was a mark on the floor to identify the photographer's point.",
          "Very nice place for families with kids, price for tickets is reasonable, also it's placed in a nice shopping area.",
          "Great place to visit. If you have company, it's even more fun. The paintings and illusions are really interesting. Everyone will have fun clicking photos in different poses and different angles.\n\nI visited this place in Aug 2014. The only problem I had was finding it's exact location in crowded area. ",
          "super funny museum, me and my friends took a lot of interesting photos and having a joyful moment in this museum!!",
          "Awesome short trip. Very worth it. From the best instagramable pics, to the funniest sexual comics.",
          "So much fun!!! The ice museumnwas the best part but it's extremely cold so bring a jacket!!",
          "It's fun although quite small",
          "Museum is good with VR app.",
          "The museum was pretty fun. Only gripe I have about it was the cost compared to everything else in Korea. It's 18000 krw for entrance into the trick eye and ice museum. There's a love museum upstairs with separate entry fees. The museum was \u2026",
          "It was Very Cool!",
          "Was fun.. A place for taking pictures.. 2hrs can finish \ud83d\udc7b",
          "One of my friends Recommend me This museum in seoul And I went with my friends There too And we enjoyed A lot .......we take a lot of pics and videos And specially we enjoyed a Lot in Ice museum it was really a great fun Hope to visit soon....",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Gwanghwamun (Korean: \uad11\ud654\ubb38; Hanja: \u5149\u5316\u9580) is the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace, in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is located at a three-way intersection at the northern end of Sejongno. As a landmark and symbol of Seoul's long history as the capital city during the Joseon Dynasty, the gate has gone through multiple periods of destruction and disrepair.  Restoration work on the gate was finished and it was opened to the public on August 15, 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\nGwanghwamun was first constructed in 1395 as the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace, the main and most important royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty. During the 1592 Japanese invasion, it was destroyed by fire and left in ruins for over 250 years.\n\nGwanghwamun was reconstructed in 1867 along with the rest of Gyeongbokgung Palace by the order of regent Daewongun during the reign of Emperor Gojong.  The gate stood until 1926, when the Japanese government had it deconstructed and moved it just to the southeast of the current location of the National Folk Museum of Korea to make way for the massive Japanese Governor General Building.The Korean War completely destroyed the wooden structure of Gwanghwamun, and its stone base lay in complete disrepair and neglect. In 1968, during Park Chung-hee's administration, the stone base was again relocated in front of the Japanese Governor General Building.  The destroyed wooden structure was rebuilt in concrete, while the sign on Gwanghwamun was written in hangul by Park himself.  Gwanghwamun remained as a concrete gate until late 2006.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nGwanghwamun underwent a major restoration project since December 2006 and was finished in August 2010. The gate was disassembled and moved back to its original location 14.5 meters to the south, and its wooden structure was again reconstructed in wood.  It was rotated in order to accurately place the gate to its original location, which perfectly aligns it with the main north-south axis of Gyeongbokgung Palace.  The restoration was commenced by the South Korean government because an earlier restoration employed concrete instead of traditional materials and wrongly aligned the gate to the entrance of the Governor General Building, now destroyed.\nThe aim of the latest renovation was to restore Gwanghwamun to its original wooden construction while paying meticulous attention to historical accuracy.  The name plate of Gwanghwamun was recreated by analyzing its century-old glass plate photographs, while its wooden structure was devised from a blueprint created in 1925 by the Japanese Colonial Government.  Pine wood used in the construction was painstakingly selected in Korea as the use of foreign imported wood for recreating Korea's historic buildings was strictly forbidden.\n\nGwanghwamun was opened to the public on August 15, 2010, to commemorate Gwangbokjeol, or Liberation Day of Korea. The project cost \u20a9 28 billion.  A new name plate on the restored Gwanghwamun was unveiled on the same day. The name on the plate was based on Hanja lettering by Im Tae-young, the general in charge of the rebuilding programme by King Gojong of Joseon, written against a white backdrop framed by Dancheong traditional coloring painted by master Yang Yong-ho. The lettering was done by master Oh Ok-jin, using the gakjajang method of calligraphic engraving, a technique designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property no 106.However, cracks in the wooden plate were showing by early November, where a long vertical crack is visible on the left side of Hanja character \"\u5149\" and beneath \"\u9580\" in the middle. The Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) blamed the dry autumn weather for the contraction of the wood, but experts differs on that an immature pine board was used to meet the deadline for completion and that the wood had not dried properly.  After many debates, a repair to the cracks was made, and the panel at CHA concluded in December 2010 that it should be replaced, hence the Government commissioned a new name plate. 13 wooden boards for the new signboard were cut in September 2011 and have since undergone a natural drying process in Gangwon Province. However, in a survey of 5,000 people conducted by the Cultural Heritage Administration, 58.7 percent responded that the inscription should be in Hangul while 41.3 percent opted Hanja. The long-lost 1395 original was written in Hanja. A majority of experts consulted thought the sign should be carved as the original had been.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe area in front of Gwanghwamun, known as the Gwanghwamun Plaza, was opened as a public open space on 1 August 2009. It is part of the Seoul Metropolitan Government's plans for environmentally friendly renovation projects such as the Cheonggye Stream and Seoul Plaza.In a poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, visitors stated that watching the changing of the guards at the main gate as their third favorite activity in Seoul. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held in front of the main gate every hour from 10:00 to 15:00.On 23 September 2012, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started on a trial basis, a 550-m designated section of Sejong-ro as pedestrian-only but permitted for cyclists. The section includes the road from the Gwanghwamun three-way intersection, along Gwanghwamun Plaza in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts to the Sejong-ro intersection.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nGyeongbokgung Station on Seoul Subway Line 3 - nearest to the Gate\nGwanghwamun Station on Seoul Subway Line 5 - located 600 metres at the southern end of Gwanghwamun Plaza\nCity Hall Station on Seoul Subway Line 1 and Seoul Subway Line 2 - located 800 meters at the southern end of Gwanghwamun Plaza\n\n\n== Videoclip ==\nGwanghwamun street\n\n\n== See also ==\nGwanghwamun Plaza\nJeong Do-jeon\nGyeongbokgung\nCheonggyecheon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGwanghwamun at Korea Tourism Organization website\nJong-ro-gu 54th 382901923829 ShinHan Bank",

        "wiki": "Ihwa Mural Village (Korean: \uc774\ud654 \ubcbd\ud654\ub9c8\uc744), is an area of Ihwa-dong, Seoul near Naksan Park that was revitalized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism's public art \"Ihwa-dong Naksan Project\" in 2006, with paintings and installation art of about 70 artists. It is a popular destination for both locals and international tourists for its murals and scenic setting.\n\n\n== History and environs ==\nIhwa Mural Village is located between Hyehwa Station and Dongdaemun Station, just below Naksan Park. In 2006, when the public art project started, Ihwa-dong, one of Seoul's oldest neighbourhoods, was a decaying suburb designated for demolition, and home to mostly poor families and elderly people. The government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism \"Art in the City\" campaign set about to improve conditions in some of these areas, and included the Ihwa-dong Naksan Project in Iwha-dong and Dongsung-dong near Daehangno in central Seoul.Ihwa-dong is adjacent to Changgyeonggung Palace on the slopes of Mount Naksan. Jongno-gu's mural village sits at the foot of Naksan Park and is called \"Ihwa village\" or \"Ihwa mural village\". Ihwa-dong and Dongsung-dong were culturally isolated towns despite their location near the busy college area of Daehangno, and the historic neighborhood of Dongdaemun with its many tourist activities.Ihwa-dong was one of South Korea's many daldongnae or 'moon villages', a name derived from their hilltop locations, traditionally thought to offer a better view of the moon than the cities below. They were inhabited by mostly working class and poor people who couldn't afford housing in flat or central parts of the city. The mural village sat against the old boundary walls of the capital and was a place where refugees squatted after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s, building homes wherever they could. Many residents worked in the nearby garment and textile industries in Changsin-dong making items sold at Dongdaemun Market. But, as other neighborhoods prospered in the 80's and 90's, with high-rise apartment towers, and the redevelopment of early 2000, residents started moving away, draining the neighborhood's vitality.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\n\n\n=== Project beginnings ===\nThe village was part of the history of street paintings in South Korea, with locals and visiting artists carrying out similar projects around the country. In the mural village, buildings and surroundings became part of the art; flowerpots, telephone poles, stone fences, stairs and even \"the crack on a wall has been transformed into a wrinkle on a smiling woman\u2019s face\". The 2006 project took about six months, with citizens and college students, including nearby Hansung University students recruited to volunteer. About 70 artists participated with the paintings and installation art that covered the walls, streets, homes, businesses, underpasses and schools.One of the artworks was a wall of the neighborhood police station which was painted with white eagles and Korea's national flower, the Rose of Sharon; others were a house with the image of Mount Naksan, the painting of a rabbit, the wings of an angel, and a flower staircase. Over the years, the art had a continued evolution of additions and changes.\n\n\n=== Naksan Park artwork ===\nThe region at the foot of Naksan Park is a preamble to the mural village with its steel art structures. The park was established in 2002 to increase green areas in the region and restore the historical site, as much of the mountain area was destroyed during the Japanese colonial era and again during re-development projects of the 1960s. It is one of the most popular photo spots, and sculptures include a gentleman and dog walking towards the sky and a couple holding hands and looking at each other.\n\n\n== Popularity problems, art removed and re-added ==\n \nThe 2006 art project brought people back, and a sense of community with art collectives and communal gardens. But the influx of tourists and their littering, noise and graffiti made long-term residents of the neighborhood wonder if the changes were for the better. About a year after the project began, they requested the removal of many of the murals, amounting to almost half the original art.In 2010, the KBS2 entertainment show 2 Days & 1 Night with Lee Seung-gi was filmed in the village and made a \"wing mural\" with two white angel wings so popular among tourists that the resident removed the artwork. Later, more wing murals were painted elsewhere.In 2012, it was used by the SBS drama Rooftop Prince as a filming location, where Lee Gak (Park Yoo-chun) had a date with Park-ha (Han Ji-min), which became a stop on the typical Korean Wave tour course.In 2013, Jongno-gu's tourism division started the \"Silent Campaign\", \"to help visitors understand that the (mural) village is also someone\u2019s home\", said staffer Lee Sun-min. Lim Young-suk, one of the artists involved in both the 2006 and 2013 projects, said the connection forged between art, the residents and visitors is at the heart of the village, \"You come up, and you\u2019re in a village where everybody knows everybody, and then you go down and you\u2019re in the city. Up here, everybody enjoys life together.\"Also, in 2013, artists united again and added another 60 displays, which brought the total number of works to more than a hundred. Professional artists, and students from Kookmin University, Konkuk University, Chung-Ang University, Dankook University and Ewha Womans University made contributions.By 2015 it had become even more popular with locals and a tourist destination for international travelers, with a continued tourism spike that year. The influx of visitors to the village continued to create problems for local residents, including a loss of privacy.In April 2016, this resulted in the removal of more artwork by residents. The most popular mural in the village, called 'flower staircase', which had been renovated in 2013 with colored irregular tiles, was painted over with grey paint, along with another mural 'fish staircase'. Efforts were being made by government and locals to build a better relationship between residents and visitors. Local artists addressed the issue by taking more care to integrate residents into projects, By 2016, there were about 100 nationwide areas where murals had been created, and ten mural villages in Seoul.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ihwa Mural Village at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art is a museum in Hannam-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea, run by the Samsung Foundation of Culture. \nIt comprises two parts that house traditional Korean art and contemporary art. Museum 1 is designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta and Museum 2 is by French architect \nJean Nouvel and Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas designed the Samsung Child Education & Culture Center.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nMuseum 1, designed by Mario Botta, houses a collection of traditional Korean art, of which 36 pieces are designated national treasures. \nIncluded in the collection are landscapes and folk paintings, traditional ceramics and porcelain, such as Celadon and Buncheong, \na bluish-green traditional Korean stoneware. As well as 14th century daggers, crowns, earrings and ornaments; and Buddhist art, sculptures, \npaintings and manuscripts.Two large volumes, a reverse cone and a simple hexahedral shape, form Museum 1. Mario Botta utilized terra cotta bricks on the building\u2019s \nfa\u00e7ade which creates not only a strong presence on the grounds but also creates a chameleon like fa\u00e7ade which changes colors, and plays with \nshadows, with the changing intensity and angle of sunlight. The shapes and materials create a modern interpretation of Seoul\u2019s history as \na walled city and reference the traditional ceramic art inside.The interior of Museum 1 includes a lobby, rotunda, and exhibition spaces. The core of the Leeum Museum is this basement lobby created by \nthe reverse cone penetrating the ground. Museum 2 and the Samsung Child Education & Culture Center are all connected here. Museum goers begin \nand end their tours in this area. Above the lobby is the white walled rotunda. Spiraling down like a helix, the rotunda delivers natural light\ninto the basement lobby and exhibition spaces. The exhibition spaces in Museum 1 are hexahedral. Visitors begin at the top and walk down \nvisiting each of the four floors which house ceramics, swords, jewelry and other traditional Korean artifacts.Museum 2, designed by Jean Nouvel, features modern and contemporary art from both Korean and foreign artists. Many famous artists such as Damien Hirst, Warhol, Rothko, Yves Klein and Donald Judd \nhave permanent exhibition spaces. The basement levels of the museum face the sunken garden and gabion walls. The gabion cages are composed of iron and filled with rocks unearthed during the construction process. The sunken \ngarden includes birch trees and ferns.Seemingly floating in place, Nouvel\u2019s creation personifies modern art\u2019s constant growth, evolution, and challenge/inquisition of society. Nouvel used extra white glass and rusted stainless-steel, the first to do so, to create \nthe exhibition boxes. Many tests were performed before the current black-filmed stainless-steel could be created. The freely arranged exhibition boxes penetrate the glass skin and allow for a more controlled exhibition space. \nLight and other factors can be readily controlled for each box. The main exhibition hall in Museum 2 is a completely open space without any supporting posts thanks to post-tension building techniques.Rem Koolhaas was charged with designing the Samsung Child Education & Culture Center as well \nas the museum\u2019s master plan. The main entrance into the lobby of Museum 1 is through Koolhaas\u2019s glass structure. As they enter the museum, visitors follow \nalong on a wooden ramp and pass under a pavilion, demarcating the threshold. He used pilotis which not only lighten the structure but also provide \na view of the surrounding buildings and site. The skin of the three story outer building is composed of steel and glass. Inside, a mixing chamber was created \nbetween the glass wall and Black box and the placement of lighting, piloti and ramps. The Black concrete box holds different exhibits.Located over the parking garage, the Sculpture Garden showcases sculptural exhibits. The garden consists of a long rectangular strip of gravel and vegetation and the wood deck which frames it. Recently two of Louise Bourgeois\u2019s Maman sculptures were featured in the Sculpture Garden.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nKorea Herald, 9 December 2010A+U #422, 11/05\nArchiworld, Culture, Project Type 9, Seoul, 2005\nArcspace\n\nDolcevita*, 06Interni #552, 06/05\nSixty Six World New Architecture 2, 2006\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in South Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art website",

          "One day and a half in this wonderful city, so I choose quality over quantity and beeline for the Leeum Samsung Museum. Here I settle in for two hours taking in exceptional examples of Korean porceline, calligraphy and metalworks which then set the stage for a leap into modern",
          "The museum is most impressive architecturally. It is divided into three sections (each called a \u201cmuseum\u201d, and each section comprised of two or three floors). I personally was absolutely fascinated by the ceramics collection on the top floor of museum number 1. Much less",

          "It was designed by 3 architects, one of them being Jean Nouvel. We visited 2 of the buildings. The exhibitions were beautiful. But no photos were permitted. The neighbourhood in which the museum is located is also very interesting to visit by food with a lot of creatively",
          "It is located around the Namsan area and the surroundings of the museum is picturesque with well-considered landscaping that can be seen from the inside of the museum. It is as though the exterior is part of the modern art installation. The best part of the learning journey",

          "If you enjoy art, this museum is nice. It has two sections, traditional art which was mostly ancient Korean pottery, and a modern art section which is mostly paintings. It is not a very large museum and the pieces are quite spread out so unless you really enjoy taking time at",

          "A perfect retreat for a rainy day in Seoul, I got free entry with the Discover Seoul pass. Many interesting pieces on display, perhaps most striking is Anish Kapoor's signature metallic bubbles in the garden. Photography policy is abit confusing, at the entrance is says no",
          "A friend took us to Leeum and we had no expectations. The two museums were equally beautiful. I specially enjoyed learning about modern Korean artists and the old earthenware collection. However our favorite part was the audio guide, which would automatically play files that",
          "Stunning museum. The architecture is splendid. The modern interpretation of a spiral cathedral-like staircase a highlight. The light entering modern museum number two. Collection small but perfectly formed. Highlight for us were the 4th floor museum number one - celadon pieces.",

          "This somewhat small museum is beautifully put together. The building itself is an art piece containing ancient and abstract pieces. At one point, a Rothko appears in the middle of ancient pottery, but it works. There is a spectacular infinity room and other novel modern",
          "They are 3 places that are cool from in museum and that people take pictures of, the rest is just totally boring. The entrance fee is 10k Won. There are 2 expositions, one is about Korean art history and the other one about abstract. The first one is just so old pottery and old",
          "For me it was boring. I have visited lots of museums and some of them were awesome and interesting and some of them were boring and not so interesting. Some of exhibits were really interesting and unusual. But generally it was like average. In this museum was absolutely quiet. I",
          "Owned by the Samsung dynasty, it has more artefacts than of the national museum. From ancient Korea to contemporary art from this vibrant country, all in a beautiful building which is a work in art by itself. Recommended.",
          "It was raining so we decided to take a museum tour, this is one of the stop, wonderful outstanding collections, can easily spend few hour here, because our time was limited, maybe the next time come here by ourselves to really explore.",
          "I highly recommend getting the audio headset which is very inexpensive compared to other museums and adds a lot more context to the tight descriptions on display. Good variety in the collection with a bit over balance on pottery and ceramics. The structure itself is breathtaking",
          "We visit this museum and were surprises. For the beginning , the architectuur of the building is wunderfull. There are 2 musea inside and sometime even a third exposition. We liked the modern museum as most. The fee is 10.000 won. Are you older dan 65 than 5000 won. We recommend",

          "In the middle of bustling Itaewon, the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art carves out a quiet respite from the city. There are a few large outdoor modern sculptures that you can photograph. These are also the only works in the museum that you're allowed to photograph. The walkway",

          "The museum itself is already a masterpiece you don't have to admire anything else. Entrance fee is at 10000 Korean won for both permanent exhibitions. The first exhibitions are all chinaware/bronze ware displays, calligraphy and Buddha statues. The second exhibitions are for",
          "Beside having a very impressive collection of ceramics, the museum also has a built in sensors for your listening guide. I was grateful that all I had to do is stand by the display to have the audio device automatically start talking about it. No need to plug in numbers or go",

          "The details of this museum are very unique. Since it is the Samsung museum you get the options having a samsung audio guide which was a really interesting museum experience. over all the artifacts are very old and different from what I was used to in the states so I would most",
          "We went to visit the museum since my husband is an architect. The building is really nice & has an architectural essence that would definitely attract those with an eye of perfectionist and into art. There are 2 exhibition halls to visit. We were too tired to go to all so we",
          "A must visit when in Seoul. Artwork ranges from Modern to thousands of years old. This museum is a cross between the Museum of Natural History and the Whitney. Great outdoor space too.",
          "On the last Wednesday of the month they have half price admission. Which is the price that this gallery should be normally. We were impressed by the ceramics exhibit and some of the great modern art on display. Of particular interest was the piece by Paik Nam June an incredibly",
          "I\u2019ll make it short and sweet. I agree with virtually all the positive remarks I\u2019ve read. Love the architecture, the collections, the flow of the place, the scale of the place and was not put off by the \u201cno photography\u201d rule nor did I find the staff rude or offensive. (However,",
          "This is a really fantastic museum and a bit of a hidden gem, some of the Korean's I was working with hadn't heard of it. The Museum is split into two sections, contemporary art from International and Korean artists and also Ancient art and lots of ceramics from the Ceylon",
          "I spent a couple hours exploring this wonderful museum in Hannam-dong, I took the subway to Hanganjin and it was a mere 15 minute walk away. The museum has an impressive collection of contemporary art from artists around the world and Korean artists in one area and in another",
          "This museum is made up of 3 interesting buildings each designed by a different architect. There are two galleries, one is a modern art exhibition and the other is Korean. Both are very good. The architecture is fantastic. The outside has a few interesting pieces. The surrounding",
          "Set in quiet location in a trendy neighbourhood the museum building designed by world renowned architects is fascinating. I liked most the museum 1 building both in terms of architecture as well as collection. The audio guide which works automatically when you approach a piece",
          "Visited on one of our last days here...not my favourite district but worth visiting for the gallery. As you'd expect from Samsung, this gallery is super modern, great architecture and great media guides. Before you pay to get into the museum, there are outdoor works you can",

          "Leeum Museum has a beautiful collection, including Damien Hirst, Basquiat, Paik Nam June etc. However, the staff really made the entire experience unenjoyable. They hovered around, seemed very suspicious of the guests and monitored you wherever you went. The proximity sensors in",
          "This was a peaceful and beautiful museum. Well-presented and explained. They also had a very nice shop.",
          "I truly enjoyed the exhibitions. My favourite was the Basquiat piece they had on display. I didn't care much about the staff, other than a few of them basically following me everywhere I went. It was as if the intention was to make me feel uncomfortable. I was there for the art,",
          "The service was horrible - no smile, all the staff on their phones and when I went to the coffee after visiting the museum for a piece of cake (which I paid) , I asked for a glass of water and the waiter told me : \"here you can get water only if you pay\" ! I was a bit shocked",

          "At one glance from the outside, the architecture and design was stunning and could appeal to the visitors. However, the turn off was the inside, where the lack service from the staff on site couldn't make up for the efforts they put into the arts on display. Staff was unfriendly",

          "Looking from the outside I really can't wait to get into this museum as I expected to see something special there. Not interesting. Absolutely poor museum. Really disappointing. Now, after the visit, I wish I staid away and save time and money because it was lost.",
          "By looking at the outside, you feel you want to go in and have a look at it. I was with my mom to visit this place with the hired private tour guide. I spent almost 4 hours to visit several levels of museum and also an extraordinary work by a special guest of artist. If you are",
          "Even if you're not into modern art, the museum's architecture is worth the visit and before or after the visit you can walk around the neighborhood that surrounds the museum. Is a very modern part of the city with great restaurants.",

          "I went to the Leeum Museum last week. For 8000 won you get a ticket for the day to see the historical section, the modern art gallery as well as any special presentation that day. It is best to pay for the electronic guides in required language to detail the individual works.",

          "It was great to see some of the preserved history of Korea as well as the latest modern art.\n\nWe went on a Tuesday right as it opened so there were only a few people around.  There are three separate museums within this museum.  The first \u2026",
          "Fantastic art but be wary of trying to take pictures of even the names of the art pieces. I tried to take the name of the Dark Side of the Moon exhibit and was immediately told I would be removed if I did so. While I understand the concern, \u2026",
          "From Korean tradition to modern art. The museum have 2? Halls, one with the traditional art pieces dating way back. And the other hall with modern, contemporary art like Damien Hirst to Andy Warhol. It\u2019s a soothing place, and after the \u2026",
          "futuristic yet simple and very unique",
          "I spent a couple of hours in the morning here, it's a nice gallery, particularly the older pieces which are presented simply so the focus is on the item itself. Some of the more contemporary paintings and installations may not to be of everyone's taste but it was a nice relaxing experience :)",
          "Its good.. in korea",
          "I highly recommend renting an audio guide! I cannot stress this enough. This will make your visit 100 times more enjoyable. Otherwise, as a tourist you will find the traditional art exhibits to be very boring. If you listen to the guide, it \u2026",
          "Fantastic art museum, certainly a must must visit when in Seoul!",
          "The outside grounds are beautiful late afternoon and early evening",
          "A must go. Good to see Korea has developed technology with art so fast and good. Modern art museum, eye opening",
          "If u r not fit to climb up or table to take a taxi, don't bother. A beautiful extravagant architecture with little/not too exciting content",
          "Not many items. Some works are too basic",
          "the museum was architecturally well designed, spaces were well planned creating different experiences throughout the museum. However, the artworks displayed was just below average, exhibiting local artist and some not so popular \u2026",
          "We used to live nearby. I always enjoy coming to Leeum.",
          "For my opinion in Tourist view:\n\nMuseum separated into 2 parts \n\n1.Old Korean Antique that there are less pieces of antique compare to many museum and too less information for each pieces\n\n2.Modern Art that might be too abstract to many \u2026",
          "Well-preserved historical art and carefully chosen modern art. Much enjoyed my visit here",
          "Giving it a 3 stars because I got shouted at for taking a picture of a window looking outward. It's extremely strict and someone is always watching over your every move. It was overall very quiet.\n\nI did like how the place was organized. \u2026",
          "Really incredible building and very modern.\n\nMuseum 1 consisted mainly of vases and pots, which is not my cup of tea. Museum 2 is much more modern and diverse. You are not allowed to take pictures of the exhibition and carry on a bag larger \u2026",
          "not interest to me. good for understanding korea culture",
          "Really cool place. The treasures handpicked by their curators are much more valuable than majority of the public museums in Korea in my opinion.\n\nThey have a strict policy of no photo taking. That said, they have a gift shop that sells a range of replicas from their originals.",
          "Amazing aquarium with lots of different sections and themes for the fish. Many",
          "Beautiful architecture. If you have your student ID it's discounted to about 3,000 won (not including special exhibition) - really worth it. The museum bigger than it looks, has 2 different parts. You can spend about 1-2 hours easily. It is a bit of a hike to get to.",
          "Well maintained.. good use of technology.. detailed information on each artifact",
          "Just no words for the kind of art this museum have \nIt's a must",
          "Stunning displays and beautiful art space",
          "Nice museum, we went and part of the exhibition was closed so didn't get to see it all, a very beautiful building with amenities though.",
          "Students get a discount, go early so you can experience the whole museum. Can't take photos of some exhibitions.",
          "Nice cool place to see old Korean traditional art and the modern one. The price is about 10000 won and you can pay extra for the audio also.",
          "High up in the list of things to visit in Seoul. Fantastic complex of 3 buildings designed by 3 different international architects. And the displays are a mix of selected korean national treasures all the way to international contemporary \u2026",

          "a great museum with great cultural artifacts and paintings , old and modern \n\nrecommended",
          "Beautiful, must see if its your first time in Seoul",
          "Highly recommend \"Museum 1\" which contains some of the best representations of Korean celadon pottery and landscape paintings.  Audio guides are lovely and the museum layout is simple and easy to follow.",
          "Really nice atmosphere, I enjoyed the chance to see both traditional and modern art pieces. Also, the price was reasonable.",
          "Nice building and great way of displaying the art. Guards were not friendly.",
          "Suitable for the one who can really know art.",
          "A building itself is a beautiful piece of art. Inside is divided into old and modern art. Small but very satisfying museum",
          "Beautiful architecture, provocative, thought provoking artwork. Unique. GREAT opportunity.",
          "Great space ig greats architects",
          "Very cool historical museum, can recommend getting the audio tour. It adds a lot of information to whatever you are looking at.",
          "Basically two museums in one: the first has traditional Korean art such as ceramics and scrolls which is not my cup of tea but the second one has contemporary art from Korea and the world and it's really good. The only downside is that they don't let you take photos of the art.",
          "I really liked this museum. It has two different exhibits. One is Korean traditional art and ceramics and the other one is modern/contemporary art. The building it self is also worth to visit since the architecture is amazing.",
          "Amazing contemporary collection.",
          "Beautifully designed fro the architecture, to the spacious display to the curated content. I especially loved the modern side. If you are an English speaker purchase the audio guide. There is text if you don't want to listen.",
          "This is a great museum all around--the architecture of the building itself, the organization and maintenance, and the choice of artworks placed side by side, especially in the international arts wing. \nI was allowed to take pictures in the \u2026",
          "Good but you should keep quite",
          "I was expecting something completely different. I found the museum to be empty, not worth the one hour travel to get to it.",
          "Yoy can't take photos inside, that is very disappoiting. I decided to visit this place because of its modern interiors but the only thing that can be shoted (by phone) is stairs. The main collection is good, but small. The price is 10000 and an electronic guide is 1000 won.",
          "Must visit place to see modern art in Seoul.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It has two parts: the potters rent collection for Korean historical artefacts like Kim Hong-do paintings and vases, and the temporary collection of more cook temporary artists. \nI liked the way you could listen \u2026",
          "Must visit contemporary museum in Seoul. If you\u2019re a fan of great architecture and art this one place is for you. It\u2019s a shame though no photography is allowed inside.",
          "I thought this was the best museum in Seoul. Unlike the larger ones, it's collection is smaller, however it is displayed much better than the others. The building itself is beautiful and each gallery looks like a future concept of what a \u2026",
          "Allows someone to see how Korea has developed in the arts aspect.",
          "I traveled all the way here to see Maman. But it no longer lives here. Was very disappointed. The other exhibitions were good however.",
          "Unintended Collaboration between Mario Botta & Choi Jeong Hwa",
          "Building look great. Exhibition hall 1 is ok. Exhibition 2 (modern art) is horrible. You will see cabinet with medicine and empty cabinet that they call that art.",
          "A must see if interested in contemporary art or old korean pottery. Two Rothko inside.",
          "The museum itself is very gorgeous. Mix between korean traditional art and contemporary. But the staff inside are very rude and not so nice.",
          "Designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and considered the best in the country, Leeum Museum houses the family\u2019s (Samsung owners) vast art collection",
          "Cool art place, dont miss it",
          "Great museum to spend a couple hours. The main draw will be gallery 2 and all of the modern art that is intriguing and impressive. \n\nGallery 1 is mostly pottery and other Korean artifacts. Audio guide descriptions are poor, so there isn\u2019t great context for the gallery. The central stairway is very impressive and a great gram spot.",
          "Museum is very modern, great exterior and interior spaces, art work displayed are pretty cool and fun, interesting neighborhood to check out (rich housing district?).",
          "Really good museum of modern art with some ancient and amazing piecies of korean culture. We didn't expect to see both things together, but they give it sense. Check the website properly, we thought we would find more, but there were old temporal exhibitions. The 3 buildings are amazing! Worth it (even climbing to get there)!",
          "It's a must to visit place if you are like me not too keen in shopping and tourist sites! The exhibition is curated well and you can rent a handset with good instructions on each art piece. Free locker and plenty places to sit and rest!",
          "This museum has two towers. The first tower displays ancient Korean relics like vases, old paintings and Buddha statues.  \n\nThe second tower, is alright.  It houses modern, contemporary, pop artworks and paintings.  Not a lot though. \u2026",
          "I love this museum, a must see! The statues of Anish Kapoor at the entrance are just stunning. The main exhibition contains all kinds of art - main emphasis on Korean history of course - presented in super modern, perfect fashion. Further it is located in a very interesting district of Seoul.",
          "Definitely worth the visit. Small but good collection.",
          "Beautifully arranged, worth the visit! Historical rare and beautiful Korean art with striking and rare modern art. #sublimecollection",
          "Not sure what I feel about this place. The museum is quiet, hardly any visitors. Staff on the exhibition floors were definitely bored (mostly playing with their mobile. We saw a group of them sitting around and they promptly stood up when they saw us).\n\nCollection wise, it's interesting but wish there's more English explanations.",
          "Interesting but you can't help to think :\nWhat would you do if you had tons of money? \nA name dropping foundation with all the art scene stars in not one but 3 star-chitect museums.",

          "Not a much busy place",
          "If you are lucky, you will get more value for your entry ticket when there's a special exhibition, like previously with Olafur Eliasson.  I returned twice as it has many pieces of national treasure and  some contemporary pieces worth \u2026",
          "It's the place where can meet various arts in city. Also there are several nice restauransts nearby.",
          "I enjoyed visiting this museum. They have an array of exhibits - ranging from Traditional Korean paintings and sculpture to modern found items art. Lovely little trip to take for a date or with friends. There is also a coffee shop where you can sit and unwind after or between exhibitions",
          "They are 3 architectural places that are cool from this museum, the rest is just totally boring.\n\nThe entrance fee is 10k Won. There are 2 expositions, one is about Korean art history and the other one about abstract. The first one is just \u2026",

          "Best ever place to explore the depths of mind and to feed your eyes wirh mesmeric beauty of art",
          "Very calming atmosphere to appreciate historical artifacts and modern art",
          "I would recommend it if you are looking for a drastic difference of a traditional and modern section. The traditional is filled with old artifacts. The modern is filled with recent paintings and structures. They have a headset with \u2026",

          "Great. Modern. Artistic",
          "Modern and interesting museum. This one is not free, but definitely worth visiting. It is also relatively less crowded than other museums. \n\nOnce you have bought your ticket, you are able to visit actually two sections. \n\nThe museum is in the area Itaewon",
          "A lovely museum with a really great cheap price. The architecture and layout were beautiful and really make you consider the art deeply. Some really amazing pieces from world renowned artists. I just wish I could take pictures inside the gallery. ",

          "Must go museum in Seoul!",
          "Nice place but not my cup of tea, I can imagine people like it but I thought it was not worth the price. I especially didn't like being watched all the time and that you couldn't take pictures.",

          "It was really nice. They have lockers for your bags. Unfortunately you can't take pictures. Personally there were many works the already had knowledge about but it was nice seeing them in person.",
          "They wouldn't let me put my finger paintings up but still very good art",
          "A very posh museum! The audio guide works just great and it is a must if you visit that place. It starts to tell you about a piece as soon as you approach it. However this museum does not have a good selection of objects. Mostly it is pieces of dishes or vases. But for those who like it - would be nice. ",
          "Beautiful museum of post-modern art. Good place to stop by and spend an hour in.",
          "Makes Guantanamo Bay seem more like Disneyland. I didn\u2019t think it was possible for a museum to so vehemently and actively discourage visitors from appreciating the exhibitions. \n\nBanning cameras is somewhat understandable, but shouting at \u2026",
          "Amazing contemporary exhibition. My friends thought it was super boring...your mileage may vary depending on previous exposure to modern art.",

          "Interesting building. Not very big, but interesting historical and modern collection.",
          "Good activity for a rainy day or a cold winter day, other than that if you are not very interested in historical pieces I would recommend to visit just the contemporary art exhibition, the other one is kind of boring.

          "Loved the collection. Would recommend making a visit.",
          "The Leeum's exhibits were fantastic. I loved the Celadon Pottery and Modern art exhibits the most. Well worth the price of admission for the Celadon exhibit alone. English speakers should pay for the headset guided tour as none of the info on paintings were written in English.",
          "Loved the museum, great architectural building. Rem Koolhaas designed the building as if you were coming out of a space ship when in the escalator.

        "wiki": "Lotte World Tower (Korean: \ub86f\ub370\uc6d4\ub4dc\ud0c0\uc6cc) is a 123-floor 555.7-metre (1,823 ft) skyscraper located in Seoul, South Korea. It opened to the public on April 11, 2017, and is currently the tallest building in South Korea and  the fifth tallest in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter 13 years of planning and site preparation, the tower gained final approval to start construction by the government in November 2010 and the first groundbreaking activities of piling and frame assembly were observed at the construction site in March.\nAt New Year 2016 the LED-pixels of the facade showed \"2016\".On April 2, 2017, Lotte shot off fireworks to celebrate its official opening.\nOn Jan 1, 2018, Lotte shot off fireworks with LED laser show for 7 minutes to celebrate New Year's Day and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== Design ===\nIn 1989, the first design was made and there was a plan. Design changed again in 1994, 1995 and 1997. The design that came out of the second Lotte World in 2002 was similar to that of France, which literally copied the Eiffel Tower. Following the revision of the bird's eye view from 2004 to 2006, the bird's eye view was changed seven times in 2008 and the design was changed in 2009 and the Lotte World Tower began to break ground.The Shard of England is said to be similar in design. The Shard, the design of renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, was launched in 2008 and completed in 2012 and opened in 2013. Its interior and elevator atmosphere are similar. In addition, space externally on the roof tower is similar.\n\n\n=== Height ===\nOn March 17, 2016, prior to the final phase of external construction, the Diagrid lantern-shaped roof structure was completed. The roof structure was constructed with steel counterparts that are each 12 meters and weigh 20 tons. The counterparts were made up of bent metal panels that are 6 cm thick, and the structure itself is 120 meters high, and it covers floors 107\u2013123. Approximately 3,000 tons of steel parts, a high-precision 64t tower crane, high-precision GPS alignment systems and highly skilled welding technicians were used in the construction of the roof itself. The roof structure is engineered to withstand its weight without reinforcing pillars, and endure earthquakes up to a magnitude of 9 under the Richter magnitude scale and winds up to 80 m/s.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nLandmark\nLotte World Tower is a landmark in Seoul. It is the first 100-story building in Korea. As of its completion, it was the fourth-highest tower in the world and the highest in the OECD countries. The conceptual design calls for a slender cone with convex, gently curved sides. An exterior of pale-coloured glass draws inspiration from Korean ceramics and features accents of metal filigree.\n\n\n== Floor plans ==\n\n\n=== Main facilities ===\nSeoul Sky is located on the 117th - 123rd floors of Lotte World Tower in Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Korea. The 117th floor is the entrance floor and the view floor; the 118th floor has the Sky Friendly Cafe and Sky Terrace; the Photozone on the 119th floor; Seoul Sky Cafe on the 122nd floor; 123 lounge, which is a premium lounge bar, is on the 123rd floor. There are four media stands on the 117th and 118th floors. The view floor has prominent views of the city, as well as a glass floor and a telescope. The sky skylight of Seoul Sky was the highest glass floor observatory as of the tower's completion. Lotte Tower and One World Trade Center have concluded an operation and technical service agreement.\n\n\n== Issue ==\n\n\n=== Urban exploration ===\nIn 2016, two Russian and Ukrainian urban explorers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov from Ontheroofs, illegally climbed the under-construction Lotte World Tower through stairs and Vitaly Raskalov then free-climbed up the crane on the tower's top.\nThe video was viewed over 3 million times as of September 2016 and received worldwide media attention. \nFollowing the climb, Lotte World Tower released posters with the photos of Vitaly Raskalov and Vadim Makhorov and banned them from the building.\n\n\n== Incidents and Accidents ==\n\n\n=== Safety issues ===\nIn 2013 and 2014, three construction workers died during the construction of the tower, and an executive director of Lotte's construction arm was given a suspended sentence of eight months in prison in 2016 for his role in neglecting safety measures at the site. In December 2014, the Seoul city government ordered the mall and cinema complex at the base of the tower, which opened before completion of the tower, to be closed for five months after water was found leaking from an internal aquarium. Independent engineers who assessed the building found that these issues bore little relation to the overall structural integrity of the building and the mall and cinema complex reopened in 2015.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBusan Lotte Town Tower\nList of buildings with 100 floors or more\nList of tallest buildings in Seoul\nList of tallest buildings in South Korea\nLotte World\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLotte World Tower Official Website",

          "Whilst at the beginning I thought it was a little pricey, the number of rides available to all and short wait time made it worthwhile. Only downside was the lack of English speaking guides within the park which made it a little difficult to get around. Other than that we had a",
          "we went there during our winter holiday, and found out that during winter some of the outdoor rides was closed. then we spend half day inside the lotte world but it was too packed, most of the rides have around 40 minutes waiting line. but its worth the fun, our 6 years old",

          "Avoid going during public holidays, school holidays and weekends. The queues are so long. It takes 1 hour to queue for any ride. The plus side is that its cheap entry tickets.",
          "My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park. Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance. Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel. Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement.",

          "Visited with my three kids. More crowded than Hong Kong\u2019s MTR Subway during peak hour. Unreal. They should have a concept of crowd control. Too many people no exaggeration. A basic swing ride took a wait of 1 hour 40 mins (quoted a 1 hour wait which was already unreasonable",
          "Average wait time per ride is 90-120mins, even on weekday. Completely overhyped and overpriced. Unless you come in via Seoul Discovery Pass. You will be lucky to hop onto 3 rides for the entire journey. Go to Everland unless you like queuing up.",
          "Not that \u201cwow\u201d like I expected Park was not as good as we expected. I was excited at first during the entrance but was greeted with disappointment after a while. The queues for all rides is too long. I waited 120 mins for the hot air balloon which is not that cool after all.",

          "The park is divided into outdoor and indoor. Outdoor features some of the most thrilling rides and coupled with a few kiddy rides. The castle is one of the prominent display outdoor that you will take picture with. Recommended to buy fast passes as most rides have very long",

          "A much overhyped amusement park, I'd say with nothing spectacular really. Generally great for thrill-seeking teenagers, perhaps adults, and families with young kids. Food is expectedly priced higher than usual. I'd say it's good enough to have been there, done that. Doesn't",
          "Visited on Tue 17 December 2019. Waited 1.5 hour for French Revolution VR. They should remove VR when it is not VR. Should have gotten the magic pass for this. Luckily this roller coaster ride is quite fun with a 360 degree turn. Only family rides have shorter queues around 5 to",
          "5th tallest building in the world. On a cloudy day not worth going to the top of the floor. Fortunately you are able to go to the 31st floor (but have to queue for the access card) where the food court is and the Signature 7/11 is located. Nothing more nothing less.",
          "Nice theme park but not at $50 USD. Rides have long waiting times and staff are super difficult to deal with. You are better off going to a local disneyland or other theme parks at that price.",

          "Good to spend a day in the theme park but nothing more even if you cannot cover everything. We bought the 1 day pass with 5 times express credits. Managed to use most on more popular rides and most are located in the outdoor section. Disappointed that a few exciting rides are",
          "Excellent price for the day. Love the inside part, perfect for smaller kids while the outside is more suited to te ed ns/adults with the thrill rides. Beautifully kept and clean. Lines flow nicely. Plenty to see and do other than the rides. Friendly staff. Great to do on a",

          "Went during spring break with a group of first graders. The kids loved it and me too:) The park is huge and and I think it has enough attractions for little ones. The parade at 2:00 p.m was amazing the kids enjoyed it while eating ice cream. I loved the fact that the park has an",

          "Still halfway through the day but this adventure land is paradise for the children. Recommended for families. Awesome 3D VR experiences. Bigger indoor than expected. Still yet to find the outdoor segment. Floors aplenty of amusement games, food stalls and activities.",

          "We accidentally went the day after Children's Day, so there were lots of school groups. It was quite tricky to find our way to the right queues as we didn't know the name of the rides, or which floor they started on. Several rides had wait times of over 2 hours which we were not",
          "Here are my tips for you to get the best out of your Lotte World visit so you can spend less time on queuing: 1. Go on a weekday 2. Buy your ticket on trazy.com. there's a special promo exclusive for foreigners which gives you an option to purchase the admission ticket at 16%",
          "I am so regretting what I wrote about this hotel just before. It\u2019s bad for club guest. If you have plan to meet with your guest or friend at the clubhouse, you MUST expect to pay for your guest or friend. Per person $25 even they drink coffee. So don\u2019t be upset if they charged",
          "Went with my 7 year old daughter. For several of the rides we went on we did have to wait for about 20 mins. There were some long lines for the roller coaster and the boat ride but I was not about to wait over 90 minutes to get on these. Plenty of food options. A great day out,",

          "Here is our experience: 3 adults and 2 kids We were picked up at 8.30 from the hotel and taken to Lotte World. The trip took some 60 min and after getting organized with tickets etc it was already 10. We were told to return to the meeting point at 11.20. We all got full day",
          "The place is huge and the best thing about it is that most rides are indoors. We didn't even realize that it had been raining for most of the day till we rode the train at Jamsil station (the station is connected to the mall) and got off Myeongdong station. I yawned through",

          "If you wanna spend one evening with your friends in way cool I recommend you Lotte World. It is cheap and you need a whole day",
          "The rides were honestly more suitable for teens or younger kids though it\u2019s still a great place. The queue for the rides were really long and it took us almost 2 hours jusy to ride a ride in the cold. Would be fun to go but not a must go if you\u2019re there",
          "Perhaps this is a bit harsh and may not be the case if you have younger children, but if I could have a do-over, I would have skipped Lotte World. We went with two teenagers and we found the rides to be meh and the long lines not worth the ride. I can see how the park is",
          "I have been here a few times and a great place when it\u2019s cold or raining. Great for teens. 110cm and 120cm seem to be the ideal heights to ride rides. Otherwise, children smaller than this will have limited access to rides.",
          "This popular amusement park which is both indoors and outdoors, is easily accessible by all public transportation. It's filled with amusements for all including roller coasters, flat rides, motion simulators and much more. Weather is not an issue since many of the attractions",

          "If one read most if not all of the reviews, you will find a few common themes: crowded, long queue, long waiting hours...... we experienced more or less the same. Looking at it at another perspective, I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and",
          "It is a huge indoor park with a small outdoor section as well. Reach early as it is not possible to cover the whole park in 2 day. It's was Christmas week so Christmas evening parade was worth seeing. Many VR rides are very good so are the outdoor ones like roller coaster, gyro",
          "Came here with my sister on a Wednesday and it was packed with students. No personal space during the line up, will most likely get bumped. Waiting time were minimum 2 hours. What foreigners need to know is that they have a lotte world adventure apps where u can reserve 3",
          "We went there on a Monday, in the morning. But the amount of people queuing was unbelievable. The waiting time was at least one hour, up to 3hours. The most popular rides have longer waiting time, ofc. During 6 hours spend there we took 3 rides total. You can buy a magic pass,",

          "Was here with a couple of friends (all in our twenties). Whilst it was a cool place, I dont think I would go here if not on either a date or with kids. For me the best thing was just seeing the indoors theme park and looking at cool things. The lines for most rides are pretty",

          "We were there during the winter. It was packed with people. Can't get into any rides as the waiting line was unending - gotta wait for at least 45mins per ride. Tonnes of kiosks and shops selling snacks, food and souvenirs. There's an indoor & outdoor park with lotsa rides. We",

          "Never miss to visit this Amusement park if you are in Seoul with your kids. There are lot of rides, shows and a whole lot of eating options. And not to be missed is Carnival parade which boosts of more than 200 performers singing and dancing as they take a round around the park.",
          "This shopping mall was directly across from my hotel , and even though I hate shopping I had to have a peek . A massive shopping centre with about everything you could want to but all under one roof . Also some very nice restaurants and food stalls with some very nice snacks .",
          "Here, Lotte World, is one of the biggest theme park in Korea. Although it is smaller than Everland, it has more thril rides here. Personally recommand French Revolution, Gyro Swing, and Atlantis for adults. Most of the other rides are for children/family. And be prepared for",
          "Ok, we were here on a Saturday night which is probably not ideal as it is very busy. The rides are mainly for little kids, so, nothing too exciting for adults. We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs. We queued for about 1/2hr for the monorail ride",

          "Visited Lotte World as part of a tour group package. Spent about 4 hours here, from 5pm to 9pm. Place was semi packed with mostly couple's and families. Certain attractions such as the horror house and mirror maze requires an additional fee of 3000won to enter. Most of the",
          "Be prepared to wait in lines and you're fine. I visited during super hot August and the lining was horrible. However, the attractions are fun and different from the ones I've been in other countries. I highly recommend the indoor roller coaster, Comet express, and Atlantis",
          "Lotte world celebrates its 30th anniversary this year (2019) and there are many shows and nice decoration around the theme park to commemorate that. The rides are still fun (despite some of them being really old) and insanely popular.",
          "The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside. However, the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably. Very long queues on a holiday and weekend. We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation",
          "We spent a Thursday afternoon at Lotte World indoor. It is great for the 6&4 yo that we have but it was so crowded. Every ride took a long wait and it felt that rides for small children were all filled by teenagers. We spent US$150 for ultimately 4 rides and that took us 3 hours",
          "I guess because it's indoor there were more emphasis on VR rides and experiences. Not the place to go if you're looking for thrill rides. The queuing time was ridiculous - over a hour unless you have a magic pass. The signs for the rides or the facilities are not clear. I walked",
          "Avoid at Christmastime! Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off. I don't know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line.",

          "Spend a full day at this theme park. It is crowded especially during this school vacation season. They had quite a wide variety of rides to cater to the different age groups. It provided enough thrill to keep my 3 teenagers occupied. They have plenty food options to satisfy",
          "We visited with a 6 and 2 year old - Both had a great time - the oldest went on several rides and the little one enjoyed the carousel and playground. It was very busy as it was close to Christmas so we left before taking full advantage of all the rides and activities. We loved",
          "Like a kid in a candy store, there are so many things to see and wanna try and ride. The 'hot air balloon' was amazing. There are performances slotted. You need to check with the Information. Lots of eating places and snack bars too. The attraction outside is simply crowded.",

          "Unless you\u2019re really desperate to spend money on any average theme park, don\u2019t go. The rides and premises feels old and tattered. The crowds are packed and the queues are crazy long (2 hours) for a short unexciting roller coaster ride. It\u2019s also small with limited attractions.",
          "Very disappointed. Expensive, a lot of attractions closed and the best attractions cost extra, which is outrageous considering the high entry fee. Even the ice skating rink required everyone to vacate after only 10 minutes. Overrated, overcrowded and totally over the most",
          "Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers, many in school uniform. It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms. We reached there exactly at 9.30am and when the doors were opened,",
          "Very strange place, but a fun time had overall. Initially when entering the park, the place seems very small. All of the big attractions aren't immediately visible. Take a few minutes to locate all of the major rides/attractions inside and outside of the park. Some of the lines",

          "What a fun day at Lotte World! So many rides and lots to see. It is difficult to navigate around. There is so much packed in that you don't see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner. It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well. Lines",
          "Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one",

          "The 'Lotte World' in Seoul is an Amusement Park in it's own. If you like water activities and other fun amusement it is worth spending time there. As it is not cheap you should allow time for best 'value for money'.",
          "We went here with a young infant so didn\u2019t explore outside as none of the rides would be suitable for our baby. Being indoors meant that we could still go there even though it was a rainy day. Lots to do at Lotte World. There are lots of restaurants and lots of shopping",

          "Lotte is a well-known chain in Korea, and its hotels have a somewhat formulaic uniformity. Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look - it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago, but doesn't seem to have moved with the times. The staff during my stay were",
          "Had a chance to see the view from the 120th floor of Lotte World. I can only say, it\u2019s amazing and worth the experience. Entrance fee is 27,000 korean won and you\u2019ll get the chance to experienced the fastest ride of your life on a double floor elevator. It only took a minute",
          "Had gone with a lot of expectations as a couple of my daughter's Korean friends really recommended it. But its an average Amusement park amd really busy. the rides are decent though have seen a lot better.",
          "Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays, it was so so crowded. The kids went crazy at this place, lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity. We spent one full day here. We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold.",
          "Besides waiting 2.5 hours in a line up for a roller coaster wearing virtual reality goggles, the first thing we did getting off the ride was get back in line for a further 3 hours to do it again. It was a memorable time but allow yourself a full day.",
          "This place provided for a fun day for our family. The key is to get the \u201cFree Pass\u201d ( Premium Pass ). This allows you to cut to the front of the line and, unlike the Magic Pass, it is unlimited and there is no need to make reservations using the app. At 100,000 Won it is not",

It\u2019s an adventure park on the inside of a building so it\u2019s not hot in sunny days. I often go there on sunny days so I",

          "We are not users of theme or amusement parks so not up on the pricing, but took my kids for our sons birthday. Getting in the door is what you pay for with the entry ticket. Rides cost extra - every single one. While reach ride doesn't cost a fortune it would soon add up if your",

          "Hotel Lotte was a bit old but very well maintained. The character room gave good excitement to my sons; 6 & 8, especially due to its Wii. Service is also excellent. I emailed them in advance to enquire about the beds since I only managed to book non-suite character room with 2",
          "This is an ok theme park. Appreciated that there is an indoor area when the weather gets too hot or rainy during the summer season. Went on a Friday and was quite surprised that the queues were not that long. Though the park was quite big, I find that there are more things to do",
          "We spent the whole day in this theme park with 4 kids under 6, 2 seniors and 4 adults. Had a great time enjoying the Lotte theatre shoe, the samba parade which was the current theme and the many rides. There's also a outdoor extension to Magic land. Very decent rides there; I",

          "There are the indoor and outdoor park. I suggest you buy the ticket online (e.g. Klook) before your visit as you can get cheaper price and some package promo (theme park + aquarium + magic pass, etc). Magic passes are very useful to avoid long queue at famous attractions. Grab",
          "Lotte World is huge with both indoor and outdoor attractions so do plan to spend the whole day there. The Fly Venture and Upside down wheel were my favourite rides. Stay for the night parade and indoor fireworks - fun for the kids. Nice view from the 'hot air balloon' rides.",

          "Good: It's a nice attraction for families and teenagers. The focus inside is more on smaller kids but outside my teenage girl had lots of fun. The park is in good condition. It looks very safe and well maintained. Negative: When I pay an entrance fee of 50 USD I don't",
          "Before I went there, I've read not so good review about this park. Some attraction you have to pay, some are only for toddlers, some are under maintenance. Because it's indoor, I think they have to do the landscape in certain way. This makes the route pretty confusing and lots",

          "Had a fun afternoon/evening with friends. A few tips: - Tickets are normally 55,000 won, but you can get discounted tickets on Klook for 28,000 won with the option to get the Magic Pass x 3 or 5 for an additional 22,000 - 34,000 won - which I would highly recommend. - If you",
          "As a 'foreigner', you can get very cheap tickets from Trip Advisor, Klook, etc. We got some from Govoyagin for 28,000. The problem we found was that it didn't include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside",
          "If you want to see and indooe park this is really cute. If ypu have children they will love to go to this place. Have a really beutiful parade at night during the cold weather. Have a reallu cute park for toddlers and they have theynown rides in really cute. I did it at night",
          "Enjoyable place to have nice time, especially if with kids. Many interesting attractions are available. Easily accessible. Better to enter early in the morning and buy full day ticket. In such case, you will not need to make additional payments for most attractions and wait less",
          "The place is very nice to travel with the family.We went there is weekend and it was very crowded .Next time we are thing to ho in week days.",
          "I visited Lotte World as group of friends in January 2018. It was the coldest month in Seoul since the temperature drop to -18 but we managed to enjoy the theme park especially the Magic Island (outdoor area). The indoor area more focused on children\u2019s and younger\u2019s attractions.",
          "Wow! That word truly sums up Lotte World. An amusement park both indoors and outdoors, shopping mall from luxury to daily goods and even a food court that will leave you spoilt for choices. It is easily accessible by subway and weather proof for winter time as you will be able",
          "Really this place is totally unexpected. Right off a subway station you get a mall, amusement park, skating rink with a shooting range in the basement. It's so many things in one small space and the execution is good! When I first heard about it I thought it would be childish or",
          "Lotte world is the fifth tallest building in the world and the third in Asia. It'a mall that has many shops, franchise, restaurants and activities. Also you can get you taxe back in the lotte department store 1st floor. It a great place for kids they get to discover the lotte",
          "The biggest shopping center in Seoul where you will find good restaurant, shops and children fin places... dont forget to visit the aquarium",
          "This place as fun, but the inside portion is mostly for children. Also, there are some rides that are not included pass, you would have to pay extra. There is a lot to do and see inside. There is a food court there and several stands to get snacks. The outside portion has some",
          "Lotte world is a half indoor half outdoor amusement park. This is extremely convenient when the temperature goes below 0. Lots of activities are proposed for kids of all ages. During weekend and special days, it gets easily crowded and lines can become very long.",
          "Very big entertaining center in Seoul, South Korea. It was a good trip to spend a whole day in Lotte world",
          "This place is huge! Filled with anything, you name it. Shopping, cinemas, restaurants, theme-park, jogging park, lake, you name it. But parking is very expensive. Still, worth a visit.",
          "You would think you should have access to all the rides in the park after you pay huge bucks for the admission at the door, You acrually will have to pay extra to kids rides if you have a toddler. The park is very entertaining and lots to do. You can definitely spend a whole day",
          "This is indoor theme park. Went with a few friends and the experience is quite nice. it's a super fun trip! and I downloaded a 25% discount coupon from baynaru!! There's both an indoor and outdoor amusement park with plenty of rides for all ages, countless shops, restaurants,",
          "Love the rides & atmosphere.. travel back to dreamland & thrilling rides. Nice food court to have dinner & watch the parade.",
          "Do yourself a favour and don't buy the tickets with rides if you do not have atleast 1 full day.The queues are extremely long and the wait is anywhere from 1-2 hours for each ride. They do have a general admission ticket which only lets you see inside but no ride. They have both",

          "If you like amusement parks or want to give your kids a treat and live in Seoul or stay there for many days I can recommend it as a daytrip. Its fun - some attractions have a hight restriction. Go there with subway if you can as this is very convenient.",
          "Outdoor rides were all closed. Thus the queue for the indoor rides were crazily long. I would go again in spring or summer probably.",
          "went there during christmas holiday week. not sure if it's due to the cold weather or if it's just the place itself. maybe it's just us. a few rides were closed. those that are open had long lines. lotte world is more of a place to take nice photos. because really it's a pretty",
          "Do your homework. Like how to use the fast pass, where are the machines to make the reservations or download the apps ahead of time. Otherwise you will waste a lot of time forming line. We went from 11am-3pm. I would actually recommend going earlier to avoid the crowd.",
          "I\u2019ve been to this place with my family. My children really enjoy it. The fly Adventure made them feel very exited. Other game like roller coaster and skate are very good. The food is nice and many choices. Really had fun there.",
          "I did see some negative reviews before visiting, and I have to agree with the ones about being over crowded. Don't be surprised to wait 2.5 hrs for rides. We spent $200 aud on entry, and sat on one kids ride.",
          "Traffic took almost 3 hours from Jung-gu and the lines for rides inside Lotte World were more than 60 minutes. Navigation for our senior family member was not smooth sailing as the elevator was always full and only stsirs from basement to ground. The place has a lot to offer but",
          "Used to visit the park a few times as a child and then as a teen, enjoyed it a lot. Of course, Lotte offers high-quality entertainment, but now the park is too crowded and you have to wait for 40-60 minutes to get on a popular ride. Tickets became too expensive recently, btw.",
          "We visited for the second time as our last visit was 8 years ago when the kids were still small, and we wanted to experience the Christmas parade to get into the christmas mood. As we are not the adventurous sort, we made Lotte World our last stop for the day and bought the",
          "Couldn\u2019t have planned for a better day in the midst of cold February. Kids were happy and smiled all day. It\u2019s super easy to find with public transport, caters for kids (especially younger ones). There is god stalls everywhere and it\u2019s next to the aquarium and shopping centre",
          "Too Long queueing - not worthy for couple One day pass not worth it. During winters out door park are closed",
          "Lotte Adventure World is a haven for parents with kids 12 and below as everything there is made for the little ones. It is a one-stop-shop and playground for parents who don\u2019t hv to fret about children being bored. However, the queue to every ride takes about 60-70!minutes. For",
          "Went there with my family of 4 and most of the outdoor rides were closed because of winter time and a lot of indoor rides were under inspection hence closed. They didn't even tell the patrons when we bought the tickets! The rest of the rides were either too kiddy even for my 6",

          "Visited with family (with 2 children) during very cold winter of Seoul. It\u2019s very good as there are indoor and outdoor theme park. Indoor theme park is perfectly well during the winter time especially when the temperature outside is minus degrees. The theme park is not very big",
          "It was winter when we visited and the indoor theme park is a haven of children and parents. Its warm and welcoming and a lot of fun. Also, the fact that full house taped a few moment of their episode here is a bonus!",
          "Small, crowded and long queue. Expensive and not worth visiting. Cheaper & better to visit HK Disneyland.",
          "Visited on a day that was pouring with rain with the hopes that the world's (apparently) largest indoor themepark would have something to offer. Even for a Monday, the place was packed. To make it worse, the outdoor attractions shut down in the rain, making indoors even more",
          "Wasn\u2019t a very good experience as I came in winter. Most of the rides were closed, so the remaining rides that are opened had very long queues! I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each! However what I\u2019ve observed is that it\u2019ll",
          "After we pre-booked our tickets our I worried myself a bit after reading some poor reviews but we had lots of fun! Lots of teens/children but we are both in our late 20s and still had a great day. Don't spend money on the mini zoo (the animals are so poorly looked after) and be",
          "Lotte World has both an indoor and outdoor theme park, and because its within the city, expect huge crowds at the various rides. Be prepared to spend up to 2 hours waiting in line for your turn on the more popular, ie, thrilling rides. Lots of food options available, but I",

          "Getting to Lotte World is really easy by Subway. Do take note that if you have purchased your tickets through 3rd party vendors like Klook, you will need to change to a physical ticket at South Gate. The indoor amusement park has a few floors. It has a roller coaster which is",
          "The rides are awesome here, and all the decors are really fancy. Avoid visiting on weekends since there will be longer lines for the rides. Restaurants are slightly overpriced but has good quality. You can also bring your lunchbox in, there's a separate terrace/eating place.",
          "We went on a weekday which happen to fall on a day when many of the schools brought their kids so the lines were a bit long for the bigger rides. There are a variety of different roller coasters, crazy spin you upside down rides, just cruising \"slow paced\" rides, 3D",
          "So glad we found discounted tickets elsewhere. The parade for the Christmas season was pretty entertaining. Since we went on a Friday after Thanksgiving, it was not crowded (thank goodness). However, I\ufe0f had to watch my children be denied to get on various rides due to \u2018their",
          "It's one of the most interesting amusement parks of S. Korea and conveniently accessible, as far as it's located inside the city. However it is really overcrowded!! In order to enjoy your time there and to avoid wasting the most of your time, waiting on long ques, try to avoid",
          "if your kid is 5 or less, stay inside. There are things to do on the 1st floor besides the Carousel. We didn't find this area until later so we wasted time outside. Outside rides are for older kids except for 2 rides which were boring/short. The boat ride was fun but it's",
          "Such a disappointing park. If everland is a stripped down version of disneyland, this is a stripped down version of everland in a shopping mall. If you have to choose between everland and lotte world, dont choose here.",
          "Very large shopping mall. You wikl find all you need over there. Especially all the famous international brands",
          "This park is so much fun! My friend and I went for the day (we\u2019re both in our 30\u2019s) and we had a blast!! The rides are a lot of fun. I was so impressed that a lot of the rides are indoors. It\u2019s a must-see for any age!",
          "The big draw for this place in Korea is that it is partially indoors. There is a very expensive shooting range here, too. The lines for the rides are usually really long...",
          "It was a fun place. When you have extra time, you can go there. It is not as spectacular as Universal Studios or Disneyland but it could do. Nothing much to say. They have indoor and outdoor area, a few rides. That's it.",
          "It may be packed, loud, the ticket may be a bit expensive but this is fun! Great place to get loose and just relax and ride the gyro and all other crazy trains, machines, boats.... Feel like a kid again, go there to have a great time and just take it easy and have a great day!",
          "I went during the summer when school was off so there was quite a lot of people. But the best thing was the magic passes. Even though some of the lines were long, by planning ahead, I was able to rid on quite a number of attractions before the end of the day. One downside was",

          "We brought 2 kids, age 4 and 6, to Lotte World theme park and they had whale of a time. Although my younger girl can\u2019t take most rides (shorter than 110cm), she thoroughly enjoy the 2.30pm and 8.30pm parade and the magic show at Fairy Theatre. We were there 11.30am - 9pm and",

          "Most of the popular rides waiting time is at least 30-40mins and we went there on a Wednesday. There is an outdoor and indoor theme park similar to Genting Highlands theme park. Do take note that admission tickets are for single admission only, once you exit the theme park,",

          "The downside was just it was overcrowded. Maybe its just because we went at a busy day. Overall its all good.",
          "We only spent few hours in there in the evening, maybe it was because the Halloween theme plus national holiday, Lotte world was over crowded. However it is a magnificent place and really good fun for children. Worth visiting for sure.",
          "Went to this place on a holiday expecting it to be somewhat slow. It was busy. Many good rides, but the cues for the roller coasters were too long. The rides I do ride were very fun and had an almost \"Disney\" level of quality to the attractions. The food was also very good. I",
          "There are many rides that are better than expected and several that are just terrible. This is a very unique amusement park design and feels huge inside. Highlights include the Atlantis roller coaster outside, Pharaoh's Furry, the night \"Let's Dream\" parade, and the free Korea",

          "My 7 years old daughter loved the place so much especially the pororo house. Lotte world is a very good place not only for children but adults as well, you have so many things to do inside. It's worth the money spent. We'll definitely visit again next time.",
          "I read so many good reviews about this place so I had big expectations. Well, it didnt meet them. Don't get me wrong, park is nice and have some good rides but nothing impressive. There is for sure better adventure parks like Six Flags or Disney World. Food inside is very cheap",

          "I didn't love it. I felt like I had traveled through a time machine back to the early '90's. The place was a bit outdated. However - my kids loved it AND it really wasn't as crowded as it could have been (I'm guessing everyone now goes to Everland)",
          "I recently attended Lotte World, and was impressed with the variety of rides on offer. All ages would enjoy this amusement park, as it caters to those who like placid activities as well as adrenaline junkies. Unfortunately, we went at the start of August, when Korean holidays",

          "i visited on a weekday and it wasn't very crowded. The wait was around 5 to 15min only. The theme park looks a bit run down. Staff are enthusiastic and friendly. My younger kids enjoyed themselves very much. Grandparents spent their time at the lotte mart and adjoining shopping",
          "For the price it was what I expected. I was disappointed they only sold beer at one restaurant and lines were insanely long. More of a place for kids and families, not adults who wanna drink and ride rides.",
          "The day i was there it was raining so..... Only half of the attractions were open. Inside is pretty filled to the brim with rides but it's mostly for little kids. I'd say middle school at the oldest. Lot of 4Dish rides... For the price you could do worse.",
          "For a mid-lifer, I found this place as just okay. Just to while your time. Good thing we went here at around 7pm where the entrance fee is much cheaper. If you have been to Disneyland, Universal Studios and Ocean Park and you just want to visit and not take the rides, then go at",

          "If I could give it minus one star I would. Wait for rides are massive, 140 minutes at 2pm in school time for one of the less popular rides. Over-priced, over-crowded - left me feeling underwhelmed and under appreciated as a paying customer. Would rather have paid best part of 40",
          "Not as many exillerating rides as many of the outside parks have to offer and we experienced really long lines, however it is very much worth a visit and we had a blast. A rollercoater ride inside is pretty hair raising. Try find foreigner discount days if you're a visitor, it",

          "Maybe cos we went on Xmas eve, too crowded and end up didn't manage to take many rides, perhaps only 4 at most. Our boys from 7yo to 16yo were disappointed. Everland was better.",
          "If you want to visit a crowded department store to spend thousands of dollars on over priced designer labels, go for it. I walked through as a curiosity to see what kind of person would pay enormous amounts of money for clothes and accessories made in China but stamped with some",
          "I spent more time waiting in line than actually trying the rides. I spent two hours just for a 5 minute ride. It's really disappointing. I enjoyed the VR and the folk museum tho. The 50,000 won is not worth it.",

          "A world class adventure park but not in the same league as the much larger Disneyland. Nonetheless, many fun rides and things to do. Adventure Island is outdoors and offers many scary/ dizzy rides. Do choose a day ( midweek)  with smaller \u2026",

          "There are 2 parts to this theme park. An indoor and an outdoor. \n\nAn indoor park from level basement 1 to level 4. Different prices for adults, children and babies. Most of the children rides have a minimum height limit of 110cm. \n\nThe \u2026",

          "Head for the most popular rides first as queues can form quickly",
          "Kidstoria is the best place for kids around 4~5 years. My doughter likes the parade 2 o'clock. I think there should be a quiet napping place for kids because it is noisy everywhere.",
          "I love the scenery when you first walk in, that makes you think you are in Italy/France (2012,) and the shows around the Halloween season are cute. I went with a friend and did not feel well the day we went, so I did not ride the Revolution \u2026",
          "Great place with kids, but too many rides under inspections which caused 1 hour 40 minutes on each ride queue, quite warm temperature inside of the dome/building, too small number of seats/benches for rests, simply too many people in the \u2026",

          "Even on weekdays, most of your time will be spent waiting in line. The rides are mediocre and suited to 6-16 year olds. Anyone looking for any thrill should NOT come here.

A number of the attractions required further payment, which was fine in some cases, but some of the additions were rides and I feel they should have been included in the entrance price.",
          "Would recommend. The roller coasters are very fun. Theme park for all ages. However the lines are very long on weekends and in summertime.",
          "The place is nice but most of the attractions are pretty old",
          "Kids enjoy the indoor park and the crowd is not that bad on weekdays.",
          "To much people and it has almost no difference between other theme park. And I'm not so interest in amusement park.",
          "We have been to four Disneylands, so this park is considered very small for us.\n\nBuy tickets online is cheaper 35,000won vs door price 57,000 won (check again, it may have changed)\n\n If you like being indoors, this is the SmaLL  place for \u2026",
          "A bit smaller than expected, but got a really good deal on ticket prices because I'm not from Korea. I don't like that you have to pay for some of the rides even though you already paid an entrance fee (just the VR rides, but still)",
          "Better to come early to make the most of the fun rides. Unfortunately, it rained when we visited so most of the outdoor rides such as Gyro Spin, Gyro Drop, etc. were closed. Also, download their app 'Magic Pass' to see the status of the rides, maps, etc.",
          "Loved it here similar to the island review, however I could do all 'adult' rides. Nice attractions and great use of their space. It looked busy at first sight but I never had to wait more than 30 minutes. But I was very flexible in which ride to do.",
          "Good Amusement Park one part is inside and the other half part is outside. You can find a roller coaster and many things else for all ages. The main problems is the waiting time... 2h30 to do the rollercoaster it's too long... many attractions were closed the Day I came... You can find many different types of restaurant inside.",
          "If you want entertainment..definitely visit it.",
          "Nice place to go with kids. Especially I like evening parade.",
          "It's OK not really something to shout about. 3 star for cost vs things to do",
          "It was extremely crowded! I have to wait for 2-3 hours for every ride. Not fun at all!",
          "Amazing destination with family. The children love it much. Many games are ready to having fun with you. From beginner to expert. Food courts are everywhere. Entrance ticket can buy from online.",
          "Came here on Halloween. Too much people but had fun. There's not much rides and some are not worth the queue.",
          "Always packed is the problem. Even on the weekdays",
          "As the park itself inside a building, the noise stays there and after a while you may get headache and dizzenes. Also it's seems a bit old. Overall there are you will always find what to do. There also outside area Magic land with some attractions too. Can be considered to visit for having fun.",
          "The world's largest indoor theme park! There are some great rides here, and you can easily fill up a whole day of having fun without repeating anything. If you live on Seoul or are visiting for more than a few days you've got to check this place out!",
          "Really good place with both outdoor & indoor entertainment.The folk museum is interesting as well, not sure why it's really empty.",
          "So fun! Buying a magic pass was the best option to enjoy my time at Lotte World",
          "Dont even bother yourself to go there, unless its your first amusement park experience. Park is small, looks old and rides are not even looking like something \"thrilling\". Even if the rides would be exciting prepare to stand in the line for 30 mins before each. Compared to many parks this one is more for children than for grown ups.",
          "Very good collection of fishes and aquatic mammals. I especially loved the Beluga Whales which you can see up close in their aquarium. It's very interesting how they seem to like interacting with humans.",
          "There was quite a crowd on a August Monday, probably due to school holidays. The crowds were insane from afternoon onwards, so it's important to plan your time well. Remember to download the Lotte Magic Pass so that you can get 3 Magic \u2026",
          "Lotte World is so big & so crowded that our family going here late was a regret. I don't think 2 whole days is enough for the theme park. So if you just have one day tour, best to go early, right in the opening then leave at closing. Enjoy \u2026",
          "Greatly organized, the line for rides is nowhere near the wait you would have at any adventure park in the U.S. is a great place for kids or for a fun date. There is indoor and outdoor fun.",
          "Nice place with a lot of entertainments. There are quite a lot of cafes and restaurants inside with reasonable price. \nThe place is large and divided to two main areas, the indoor and the outdoor. There are also some additional places that \u2026",
          "What a wonderful place!",
          "Buffet @ seven springs Restaurent is delicious.",
          "Overrated. Doesn\u2019t cater to foreigners. Shows are all in Korean. Over priced considering how long it takes for rides,attractions,and games. Too crowded. Boring.",
          "Avoid at all cost. The queue line are always unbearably long cattle pen in a mass of excited kids. Any time, any day. It'd be fine if they did their best to reduce them but this park has reached a new level of not giving a dam. The boat \u2026",
          "It was awsome! Lot of fun rides. But too much people",
          "Some of attractions are little bit old but they are located indoor side so it's convenient on rainy or cold days.",
          "Located near Lotte Tower & not to be mistaken with Everland. The theme park in Lotte World is indoor. I did all my last minute shopping here: Instant noodles at Lotte Mart & toys for my boy at Toys R Us. There are lots of restaurant as well & accessible to train (line 2).",
          "First of all it's crowded. it is not worth to go there spend money and time to get what total 10 to 20 minutes rides or activities. staffs are rude and there is no proper information desk. it was quite difficult for me as a first time \u2026",
          "A lot of the rides were closed as it had been snowing a lot as of late. The show was okay but quite lengthy",
          "Fun but its recommended to come early or else u hv to que up more than 2 hours just to play the popular game",
          "Rides were fun, and the rides weren't even that long. The fact that a good majority of the rides were inside is an achievement in and of itself. However, the outside area is much more crowded and feels like a cheap knock-off of Disneyland.",
          "A little crowded given it was the weekend but still managed to get into a couple of interesting rides with the magic premium.",
          "Many foreigners come here. Nice place",
          "It was great, BUT they had a lot of attractions CLOSED, and sometimes they would close an attraction down. A lot of the eateries closed down early. I guess they are not interested in making money. The laser light show was terrible! I mean really sucked.",
          "Fun activities for the whole day",
          "Didn't go in but it looks very pretty from the outside, very charming.",
          "Wonderful theme park.",
          "An indoor and out door theme park. You can get there by subway Line 2. Sign board is well organized you can easily get to the main gate or the South gate by following the direction sign board. Attahced is a video taken during the tour around the Lotte World Adventure unless Google Maps cut some of long video",
          "A great theme park to be visited in Korea when travelling with kids",
          "The environment is clean and things are well maintained. Because we went during hot days, I don't really was having fun though.  Haha",
          "Horror halloween season. You can use LotteWorld App. Then you reserve attration and ride more faster!",
          "Nice place to spend a day. The rides are quiet OK. The app can be used for those who holding a fast pass. But pity its actually faster to queue rather putting timeslot in the app to comeback later for the rides.",
          "The indoor theme park is interesting. They are doing a holloween event until early November",
          "Beautiful amazing place for everyone",
          "Kids area was not that crowded with good selection of rides, but many popular adult rides like french revolution, flume ride and gyro swing all had ridiculous waiting time of more than 30 minutes to one hour even on Tuesday.  Also, day pass \u2026",
          "Real fun. However, expect lots, lots and lots of people",
          "Amusement park, quite busy and crowded during holiday",
          "Thoroughly entertaining collection of ridds. Especially good if you don't care about the usual branded characters. Really easy to get to as well.",
          "A bit small but very fun nonetheless!",
          "Not many attractions that my toodler could play. Maybe suit for child 8 above and adult..",
          "A very nice place and especially good for Children of all ages.  Looks beautiful inside and very neat.  Food court also caters for all .",
          "Didn't quite get to see everything as it was impossible to fit it all in a day but was quite pleased to see all the things available. The rides were fun, food/drinks were decent, activities were entertaining and the shows were appealing. \u2026",
          "it s ok... but the themes and attractions could be built better... no comparison to disneyland but still ok",
          "Good place for kids and teenagers",
          "Really awesome place.  Avoid the PANDA American Chinese restaurant.  Please  Don't go to American Chinese restaurant.",
          "SO MUCH FUN EVERYWHERE TRULY MAGICAL SND EXCITING. Especially when I went with my friends.",
          "Delightful place.  Reasonably priced, but many of the most popular rides were closed 2 hours before the posted closing time.  I recommend going earlier you want to ride those rides so as not to waste the admission price.",
          "nice place to spend time with family",
          "Nice place for family n kids... not big but have various games  .. I advise to get the fast fwd pass to avoid the queue n after 4 PM the ticket becomes cheap  ...",
          "Awesome theme park with many extreme ride",
          "Nice place to spend a whole day. Outside and inside parts.",
          "A place that unashamedly takes inspiration from Disney world, with a lot of fun things to do, plenty to see and some decent rides. \n\nThe food is a little pricey and some of the queues can be insanely long, however it was an amazingly fun day.",
          "Not much rides and lines are extremely long. The Atlantis is my favourite ride waiting took about 1hour and 20min but the ride is extremely fun",
          "Excellent for rainy days and hot summer. We entered after 4pm and there was a discount and we stayed there until closing at 10pm! Will absolutely visit next time travel to seoul. \ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa0\ud83c\udff0",
          "All games, all fun, all day. They have all the games you want for all ages, they have live showsand they have many other facilities. You can't go wrong here.",
          "Absolutely hated it, 6 hours and I only got to ride 4 attractions. Not worth it unless you get the pass to skip the lines. Lines have ridiculous wait times, expect most to be 45-70 minutes long, or more. They also don't tell you that many \u2026",
          "It was crowded but good to enjoy.",
          "Awesome theme park. Lots of fun rides. Allocate a whole day especially if bring kids. Beautiful and picture perfect, both indoor and outdoor. Need to expect to long queue during peak hour.",

          "Pretty cool VR place there. However, I couldn't finish one of the games because I'm such a wuss",
          "Very popular among the Korean students. Difficult to measure up against Universal studios...",
          "One of the main place you would visit even if you arent korean but a foreigner. I recommend gyro drop for sure and gyro swing. The lines might get crazy long if you go during the korean vacation or the weekend so make sure you time well when to go",
          "It's one of the exciting places I went to in Seoul during my summer holiday.\nI liked the roller coasters.",

          "Huge indoor Theme park quoted as the largest with many rides, acitivy area, Food & Beverage and Dessert stalls. However this is more suited for teenagers and below, not much for adults. To skip queue you can pay more for a magic pass. Do \u2026",
          "Fun theme park in Seoul.",
          "Place is beautiful. However the waiting time for rides are unacceptable. Expect to wait between an hour and 1.5 hours per ride. Lovely for kids to enjoy. Virtual reality 4d was quiet enjoyable",
          "to crowded, waiting for attraction 2-3 hours and but attraction is only 4 min. not worth it",
          "Great place to have fun!  Lots of interesting rides and stylized cafes!",

          "Got our tickets from Klook (for 32 000 KRW). Arrived at the place at almost 11am and left at around 9.30pm. My friends were able to take almost all the fun rides except for one (French revolution line is always long!). I downloaded the \u2026",
          "Fun experience good food and not super expensive!",
          "Probably the second best amusement park in Korea? After Everland. This one has indoor and outdoor attractions, which is a plus, since you could still have fun inside when it is raining or when it is riddiculously hot outside. They have \u2026",

          "Amazing best to get fasttrack if you have the finance to spare since the lines get pretty long in some rides over 2 hours!!",
          "The worst theme park i have ever been, spent over US$100 per person, but none game i can play, the fast pass was a lie, first come fisrt serve bases, tried 15times but couldnt get one pass for game, need to line up for 3hrs....we gave up eventually",
          "Just good but much worse than the Everland.",
          "Nice and fun, but could be better. Things appear cheaply done, obvious cameras and ride triggers for example. Others are poorly laid grass turf and stuffed animals in rides.  \n\nNice prices for food and souvenirs etc (much better than \u2026",
          "Love this place! It's like heaven basically. Make sure to go on the Flume Ride inside, and check out Atlantis and Gyro Drop outside. Perfection in one place, but the tickets aren't overpriced either. Beware, food is kind of expensive.",
          "Great place for a family outing with kids below 12 years old. Most rides are in enclosed area and air conditioned. Food is mediocre however a recommended place for families to spend a day.",
          "Great place for kids n teens",
          "Yup, lotte world got tons of ride, which is good for those people that can handle dizziness unlike me.",

          "Be careful safety all the time.",
          "May be small but you can spend all day there, price is cheaper after 3pm*. Wearing school uniforms is the trend so I recomend renting one do you get the whole experience. \nLong lines by the way.\n(There's a panda express inside)",
          "Really nice amusement park, but it was so crowded, and I went during a weekday. I bought fast passes, but couldn\u2019t even use them on all the popular rides because the app just wasn\u2019t working properly. They\u2019d all be taken a few seconds after you can book a fast pass.",

          "Happy place, have a great time with family or friends!",
          "It's a first time for me to experience an indoor themed park which they have. It's not crowded on a weekday but lines took about 20-30 minutes because of students wanting to get on the same ride all over and over again. \u2026",
          "Cool place, but busy with long wait times for rides",

          "I had a lot of fun here! I wish we spent more time. We were given food stubs by our tour guide to be exchanged for food to any of the restaurants inside. The lines were not so bad at the rides, I think we waited longer in line for our dinner. The food was delicious though!\n\nThe parade was beautiful.",
          "A quite well-organised indoor theme park that kids will love. This park keeps visitors busy, come rain or shine. It offers a fast-track reservation to reduce wait times at a long queue lines. A number of Korean dramas were filmed here so that you would get the feelings behind the scenes.",
          "There are many interesting rides and experiences here where some are interactive and 4D, but there are too many people which cause all the lines to be tediously long, the longest being more than 2 hours. The use of the app provides magic \u2026",

          "It's very fantastic amusement park!",
          "Good place but the ride kinda made us bored. But still love the ambience!",

          "Cute but very old fashioned",
          "Indoor and outdoor Theme Park. Great amusements including VR experiences. Recommend to visit weekdays to avoid long queues. Restaurants, cafes and enough toilet facilities. Ice rink is located in basement. Must go if you visit Seoul.",
          "Wait tooo long even for fast track",
          "I\u2019m a bit jaded as I\u2019ve been to amusement parks around the world, but I wouldn\u2019t rank this one too high on the list. Price was a little more than I think was proper for the number and quality of rides.",
          "It was amazing, I especially loved the viking but the waiting time was just to much but they do show the minutes you have to wait.  I went with my family and friends and we all enjoyed it!",
          "Some of the more fun rides we down so that it. Other than that it was super fun and entertaining.",

          "The overall feel of the place is very 'dated'.",
          "Loved it but lines were very long. It is indoors so it's not affected by the weather. My favorite part was the Folktale Museum in Lotte World - be sure to visit.",

          "There's a nice variety of rides, better to go early because it's always busy. The fairy forest is a nice option, it's a small extra fee but there's a variety of animals to see. The headbands are very cute and affordable. Some lines move quickly while the more popular rides take a while",
          "Goof place for family with kid to play all kind  of game indoor or outdoor adventure game and can do shopping.",
          "One of the best mall in Seoul. It's located just next to Korea tallest tower with presence of all major brands, a big food court with a large range of dining options to choose from. One of the must visit option in Seoul city.....",
          "Well the place is huge, but man its too crowded even on a work day. Waiting in line for 15-40 min for a ride that will last for 30 sec is not worth it. The rides arent even that fun. Throughot the whole day i was only able to ride 3 rides. If the. lines were shorter it might of been more fun.",

          "Suitable for kids. We find it less attractives or interesting. Only spend few hours instead of 1 day",

          "While I am SUPER glad we went to Lotte World to experience it, it left us feeling rather depressed and disturbed, as though we had just awoken from a bad dream. The indoor park and its adjacent outdoor park are impressive, especially given \u2026",

          "Great indoor themepark in korea",
          "Amazing place, lots of ground to cover, best to arrange an entire day in order to take all the rides. Foreigner should purchase tickets using klook, cheaper that way. The express ticket not really worth it as some of the ride doesn't allow you to apply on it and you will have to queue normally.",

        "wiki": "Jogyesa is the chief temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, becoming so in 1936. It thus plays a leading role in the current state of Seon Buddhism in South Korea. The temple was first established in 1395, at the dawn of the Joseon Dynasty; the modern temple was founded in 1910 and initially called \"Gakhwangsa\". The name was changed to \"Taegosa\" during the period of Japanese rule, and then to the present name in 1954.\nJogyesa is located in Gyeonji-dong, Jongno-gu, in downtown Seoul. Natural monument No. 9, an ancient white pine tree, is located within the temple grounds. Jogyesa Temple is located in one of the most popular cultural streets in Seoul, Insa-dong, near the Gyeongbokgung Palace.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Jogyesa Temple used to be known as Gakhwangsa Temple which was founded in 1395. During the Japanese colonial invasion of 1910-1945, the temple become one of the strongest fortresses of Korean Buddhism. Gakhawangsa Temple emerged as the temple of the resistance to Japanese efforts to suppress Korean Buddhism. In 1937, a movement for the establishment of a Central Headquarters began which was successful with the building of the Main Buddha Hall of Jogyesa Temple in Seoul in 1938.The temple became known as Taegosa Temple in 1938 and by its current name of Jogyesa Temple in 1954. The name Jogyesa Temple was chosen to denote the structure's status as the main temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism (Buddhist sect which combines and integrates the Korean Zen and Textual Schools of Buddhism). The Jogye Order has 1700 years of history and is the most representative of Korean Buddhism Orders. The Jogye Order is based on the Seokgamoni doctrine and teachings of the Buddha, and it focuses on the mind and nature of this.The Daeungjeon (Main Buddha Hall) was constructed in 1938 of pine wood from Baekdu Mountain, and it's always filled with the sounds of chanting. In the main temple courtyard there are two trees which are 500 years old, a White Pine and a Chinese Scholar tree.\nThe White Pine tree is about 10 meters high and gave the nearby area \u201cSusong-dong\u201d its name (Song means 'pine tree'). This tree was brought by Chinese missionaries during the Joseon Dynasty. This pine tree sits besides the Main Hall, and its branch towards the Main Hall is only partially alive. One side of this tree is adjacent to the passage, while the other side sits next to the building. Therefore, because the area is inadequate for the tree to grow, the Lacebark pine is not preserved well and since the Lacebark pine is a rare tree species and is valuable in biology, it is designated and protected as a Natural Monument.The Chinese Scholar tree, which is 26 meters tall and four meters in circumference, silently stands watch over the temple grounds.\n\n\n== Access ==\nTo enter the temple Jogyesa have to go through first Iljumun or the one pillar gate. The Iljumun is an entry that represents is the division that separates the mortal world from the world of Buddha.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nJogyesa Temple's features is a mix of traditional temple and palace architecture. The lattice designs found on the doors and windows of the Daeungjeon are unique in their own right. The temple also features the Geuknakjeon (Hll of Supreme Bliss) in which the Amitabha Buddha is enshrined, the Beomjongnu, a structure where a bell which enlightens the public with its sound is housed, and an information center for foreign nationals.Temple also has colorful matsya (Sanskrit for \"fish\") which is sacred to Hindu-Buddhists as it is one of the avatar (incarnation) of Hindu deity Vishnu which has been described in detail in Matsya Purana and  6th BCE Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nBuddha's BirthdayThe festival, designated Korea's Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 122, will take place at Jogyesa and Bongeunsa temples and along Jongno Street on May 6\u20138. The origin of the three-day festival dates back to the Unified Silla era over 1,300 years ago, when the festival was held on Daeboreum, a day celebrating the first full moon of the lunar calendar; During the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), Yeondeunghoe turned into a festival marking Buddha\u2019s birthday.Lanterns featuring lotus and other traditional figures and objects representing people\u2019s wishes will be hung on May 6\u201322, from 6 p.m. to midnight at Jogyesa Temple The highlight of the three-day-long celebration is the Lotus Lantern Parade, which winds along Jongno Street from Dongdaemun Gate to Jogyesa Temple. With thousands of participants, each carrying their own lantern, the parade becomes a river of light flowing through the heart of Seoul.\nJogye OrderJogyesa came to the attention of the international news media in December 1998 due to several monks occupying the temple in a power struggle between factions of the Jogye Order. In the end, riot police were called in to take control of the temple and oust the protestors after they had occupied the building for more than 40 days.\nKyeongsin PersecutionFrom 27 to 31 October 1980, during the Kyeongsin Persecution, the government raided major Buddhist temples throughout the country, including the headquarters at Seoul's Jogyesa, under the guise of anti-government investigations and an attempt to \"purify\" Buddhism.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temple Stay ==\nTemple stay is a cultural program which anyone can experience the life of buddha practitioners and also learn about the cultural knowledge transmitted throughout Korean Buddhist history. The temple stay of Jogyesa consists of various activities related to Korean tradition and buddhism. Everyone who wants to make distinctive and valuable memories such as experiencing Buddhism or talking with Buddhist practitioners can take part in. And also this program show people how to control their mind and introspect themselves. People can make those techniques their second nature and can achieve inner peace by practicing them. It is a chance to know how to be happy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Buddhist temples in Seoul\nBuddhist temples in South Korea\nReligion in South Korea\nReligion in Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nJogyesa : Official Seoul City Tourism\nBrief illustrated profile\nKNTO Destination guide: Jogyesa",

          "Crowded, international, vibrant and intriguing. I think these words pretty much describe the temple. It's a must, if you're in Seoul, especially if you love visiting Buddhist temples. However, it's not your usual serene temple experience. It's beautiful, in it's own, colourful",

          "We got a pleasant surprise when we visited the temple. I have been to quite a few temples in Korea, but none of them showcased flowers the way Jogyesa does. Autumn is the season for Chrysanthemums, and the whole temple is adorned with them. It was a cold, gloomy and wet morning",

          "Found this by accident and didn't realise I was so close to it. Very pretty and peaceful place. Especially nice when they ring the bell (end of the day in my case). Came back one night while prayers were going and quite serene.",

          "On my first morning in South Korea, I went to Jogyesa Temple. The way I do it when I visit a buddhist temple in Thailand, Laos or Cambodia, I got there, took off my shoes and entered. And only then realised that there where plenty of people inside the temple, praying. Maybe if I",

          "Stopped by here to visit this rather small temple complex just west of Insa-dong. Took a free guided tour from the \"foreigners'\" office and received a free postcard with commemorative stamp and refreshing lotus tea. Very informative tour by a friendly Buddhist. The lotus were",
          "Very peaceful temple a few blocks from Anguk station and the main Insadong street. If you can go during a festival it's quite beautiful. Take photos and admire the scenery but understand that this is a religious place so be mindful when people are in services If you can go",
          "You can see lotus in pots rather than in the more traditional lotus pond but don't worry there are fish floating above the flowers which more than makes up for the lack of a reflecting pool. Actually there is a small pool with water lilies that is quite nice. The temple was big",
          "I stumbled upon this religious site my first day in Seoul. It was quite a pleasant walk from the Centermark Hotel. The Buddha statues are enormous. I always feel shy to take photos of religious sites, because I don't want to be offensive but nobody seemed to mind. If you go feel",
          "A working or should I say an area of worship for many locals. The buildings and the 3 buddhas were golden and impressive, but you need to be respectful to the people worshiping there. However it does seem a little strange when you realise that all these modern sky scrapers",
          "One of the most beautiful places I've ever been. Really spectacular and breathtaking. You can also do a tea ceremony there (we decided not to) which would be a unique experience.",
          "I don't think I can properly describe the beauty and peace of this temple. The colors are like the traditional ones found throughout the palaces and temples but the 3 giant Buddhas in the main hall were the highlight of this place. My aunt and I went during the mid",

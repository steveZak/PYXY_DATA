        "wiki": "The Fairy Pools  are a natural waterfall phenomenon in Glen Brittle on the Isle of Skye.  The pools are a vivid blue  and are a popular place for wild swimmers who brave the frigid waters.The habitat of the Fairy Pools hosts a variety of animals, such as red deer, rabbits, and sheep. The area is also host to a large number of birds. Large flocks of crows, ravens, and gulls are present in the area, as well as such smaller birds as meadow pipits, turnstones, common ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins, and curlews. The physical landscape is predominately rocky, with some boggy areas here and there. The water in the area is typically cold, as the pools are fed by mountain streams.The Fairy Pools are a popular location for walkers. It is about a 20 minute walk to the Fairy Pools from the Glen Brittle car park.\n\n\n== Internet hoax ==\nIn 2013 an internet hoax circulated suggesting the Fairy Pools had sprouted vivid purple flora.  The images circulated were actually of the Shotover River in New Zealand.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Fantastic place, scenery out of this world. A place to revisit several times, great that its on our doorstep.",
          "Amazing place to visit. We were so lucky that it wasn't too busy for us to sit and get lost in the peace and tranquility. Again the weather was perfect and we could see all the beautiful surroundings. Not great for people with walking difficulties but I managed even with my",
          "This is truly a breathtaking place located in Isle of Skye. I had wanted to visit here for many years, It was even more gorgeous then I had anticipated. We were here on a very wet and cold day, still well worth a visit. There is quite a bit of walking to see the streams and",
          "We went on a rather wet afternoon, the car park was full and had to wait for a short while to get a lot. The landscape and views were stunning, the walk was nice, though was pretty crowded on the day we went. Saw a guy swimming in a few of the fairy pools, braving the cold wet",
          "Just wow for everything. Great roads and a challenge as well. Stunning scenery and the pools are beautiful to look at and even some people were jumpin in but it is cold",
          "This was our second visit to the Fairy Pools although this time in very different weather. It was very windy when we started the walk and later we had horizontal rain on the walk back to the car which soaked us. There is a new and very large car park which costs \u00a35 and there is",
          "It was snowing when we went but oh so beautiful. I wish we would of kept waling but our shoes were soaked from the rain and snow. Make sure you bring your wellies!",
          "No signage to the pools but we managed to find them okay. It was raining and hailing quite badly but did not put us off. Not a large car park but managed to park okay for a charge of \u00a35 - can imagine this is a nightmare in peak season but they are in the process of building a",
          "Not a bad hike at all. Please do it because the pools are worth it! Very few places that you can see crystal blue pools. It started to snow while we were there but it didn't stop us from just sitting and soaking it all in. Beautiful!",
          "Coming up to Skye in Winter turned out to be one of the best decisions. Everything was so tranquil and weather (despite the occasional hailstones and high winds) was somewhat perfect for the time of year - as it stayed dry during our visit! We felt it just added to the feel of",
          "This is exactly the sort of place we moved to Scotland to avoid. What was once probably a pleasant and remote waterside spot has now been utterly ruined by hoards of tourists descending upon it in their coach loads. The single-track road cannot cope with the traffic, the new car",
          "My son and I visited in February. We arrived at about 3.45. Parked easily with no charge. 30 min walk to pools Pools were clear and a wonderful colour We had a quick swim and the water was not as cold as expected. Great fun. Not too busy only 2/3 more small groups of",
          "Visited with my parents who were up for a visit and it was such a beautiful, clear, and cold day, and wonderfully quiet; it is February after all. There is a new car park fee which is going towards facilities being built, so I have no issue paying. The walk down was wonderful,",
          "My friend and I visited last Monday and were happy to support the local community in their efforts to improve the whole area through their car parking charge. It had rained a lot in the preceding days so when we tried to cross the stream, we couldn't. We walked up and down",
          "For me this was one of the most beautiful spots in our entire trip. There are ongoing efforts I believe by the locals to provide better facilities there. However, currently there is authorised parking which costs \u00a35. From there the pools are about 15 mins walk (really depends on",
          "I have to be honest I wasn\u2019t as enchanted about the \u2018fairy pools\u2019 as my wife. She was dead keen to visit I was underwhelmed to say the least, now it was December and midday so maybe the light wasn\u2019t right or something, but to me it was a fast flowing stream collecting in pools",
          "Take a straight forward stroll up the path beside the burn and then keep going to the foot of the mountain, picking up the path to go left and join the path back down across the glen. Car parking has improved and you pay cash to a person on duty.",
          "This whole country is amazingly beautiful. There is some uphill walking and navigating rocks to go to this location but it\u2019s very doable. Just go.",
          "Shame they are charging for car to be parked, and you have no alternative by the time you have driven all the way there! Lovely pools which probably be even better with a blue sky! Luckily it wasn\u2019t busy....but could imagine it would not be so nice with crowds of people.",
          "I couldn\u2019t have better things to say about the fairy pools! One thing I just want to give you a heads up about, is the car park. \u00a35 in cash or you can pay online before you go. We could have been caught with no cash or signal, so just a wee heads up. The fairy pools is about an",
          "A great walk taking you around an hour of your time from the car park area. Fairy Pools are very popular and there are always a good volumn of tourists around. If raining heavily you will need to be able to negotiate the streams.",
          "If you see this on the internet, there are beautiful, sometimes magical pictures. Reality is a whole lot different. It is very hard to find. I found it on Google maps but it was certainly not on my U.K GPS and not in the pretty comprehensive travel binder/atlas we had. It is",
          "Get there early--minimal parking, but nice walk, beautiful pools, but lot of tourists. Take a lunch and spend the day.",
          "The Fairy Pools get very busy during the summer season and the single track road can get very congested with cars/camper vans parking on the verge causing huge tailbacks. You now pay \u00a35 at the car park and with the money they will be building toilets, having a small cafe and",
          "This is a lovely day out. A good walk. Just be careful at the stepping stones. Our visiting in November on a chilly day they were slippery going. On our return things warmed up and the stones were Ok. I would recommend have a walking stick.",
          "Visited here in november walked over the hills from sligachan to the fairy pools a good 2 hour walk but a much more impressive walk through waterfalls and pools. Reached the fairy pools what a disappointment the most unimpressive sight on Skye and they have the nerve to charge",
          "The scenery is absolutely stunning. It\u2019s quite an easy walk but the stones can get very slippery when wet. They do charge 5\u00a3 for parking but that money goes towards maintaining the area including the parking. And by next summer they will have built a public toilet.",
          "A mile long walk in a beautiful scenery and through rocky pools with crystal clear water. They say the water takes different shades of blue and green as the sunlight hit the pools. You have to hope for a sunny day tho. I wasn't lucky, damn.",
          "Fairy pools are a set of rock pools fed by beautiful waterfalls. Crystal clear water can be green and or blue. This is a wonderful place to explore by walking. Do rug up though.",
          "We enjoyed our hike around the fairy pools. Be advised, they now charge a 5 GBP parking fee to park there. It was a nice walk and lovely views, well maintained.",
          "A beautiful place, but so busy, much busier than when last visited. A coffee van or somewhere to buy snacks would do very well",
          "Fairy Pools is a remote attraction accessed via single track roads but it's worth the effort to get there. Once there and parked (for a fee in a large lot with no bathroom facilities), you'll find the trail is fairly easy but if it's crowded you will be in a long dense line-up",
          "Beautiful is all that needs to be said about this location, \u00a35 parking to leave your car all day which is fine and all proceeds go to to the car park and funding for toilets to go there so good work! The pools are just beautiful i felt like i was in Lord of the Rings being",
          "Absolutely beautiful! We were lucky to go in October though, when it wasn\u2019t so busy. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d want to go in the high season though. There are other less known but equally beautiful spots nearby",
          "This is not an easy area to access. No published tour book appropriately prepares visitors for this wonder of nature. Don\u2019t get lost, don\u2019t twist an ankle \u2014 you are on your own. You will not find a visitor center, there are no bathrooms (and no easily accessible bushes either!)",
          "We loved our hike up to the fairly pools. There is plenty of parking (for a small fee) and the hike follows a small river with many pools along the way. This is a hike. The pools are not located right near the car park but it is not a long hike to get to several beautiful",
          "We took the short drive from Broadford to the Fairy Pools and the scenery was beautiful. There is a car park at the start of the path to the Fairy Pools (\u00a35.00 per car). The path itself is rocky and hilly with a few streams with stepping stones to navigate. Would not recommend",
          "Nice hike. Get past the tourist crowds for the best experience and to photograph it without people in the scenes. You can camp near the car park area, which i will do next time.",
          "It was a beautiful drive from Dunvegan, and we made it with enough time to enjoy the walk and beauty of the area. The path is very well marked and relatively easy to navigate, but would be too difficult for anyone with mobility issues. A few places you must step across the rocks",
          "They have a paid park to visit the place but u can also park ur car a little before or little after the park...lots of place..and avoid the 5 pound fee...or come to the place after 5 when the guys leave... spectacular place..a lot of hiking...young children less than 5 years are",
          "A really lovely activity. The walk from the car park is about 1.4k, it\u2019s hilly and rocky with a few streams and stepping stones to navigate - probably no good for a buggy or a wheelchair. The pools themselves are lovely. We went on a weekday in October, though we got a beautiful",
          "Unfortunately, we were there on a stormy&rainy day. Nevertheless many tourists. Although the pools are quite nice, most of it (the brooks and waterfalls especially) you might find on many, many other places in the Highlands, without so many tourists.",
          "There is a Car Park - better than other places - at a charge \u00a35.00. There is also an explanation with their future proposals and to save erosion. Use it. The walk is muddy, even wet. The Pools themselves are a number of small and even bigger intertwined waterfalls. it is a great",
          "Another Skye must do. Impressive setting, the mountains made me feel tiny! Beautiful clear cascades and I managed to get photographs without too many people in them as it's a very popular destination.",
          "Are people seriously moaning about the weather and giving 1 star, and moaning about \u00a35 parking charge?! There is a reason there\u2019s a parking charge and you\u2019re in skye ITS GOING TO RAIN! Don\u2019t come if you don\u2019t like the rain! My boyfriend and I travelled up from Edinburgh and",
          "You pay five pounds to park but the hike and scenery of the pools and the Black Cullin mountains are worth it. Hike back further than most tourists as every pool is unique. It has to have been thousands of years for the water to erode those pools.",
          "General info: - Windy road to get to the parking lot, be courteous and be aware of turn outs to let people pass - 5 pounds to park - Very well maintained path for a moderate hike (don\u2019t travel off of this and disrupt the surrounding plants) - 1.5 hours round trip depending on",
          "For me although the pools are pretty, the setting of the surrounding mountains is the major attraction. The walk itself is fairly easy. Although I have seen complaints about the parking fees it seems reasonable to generate income to provide facilities and to extend the graded",
          "Worth the isolated drive... Very popular. Moderate hiking. Must pay for parking. Basically, this is a series of small to medium waterfalls cascading off the hills. Some walking over rock connectors that are slippery.",
          "Huge new car park (costs \u00a35). Cross the road and walk the track to the bottom of the Cuillins. Relatively easy going along the track so long as you are able bodied. The pools and waterfalls are fabulous. We went in October and it was fairly busy but I imagine it would be",
          "We had debated going to the Fairy Pools because we had heard it had become a tourist trap. Well, it definitely was, but we were glad we went. You pay for parking and had to deal with tourists not understanding Scotland roads. This was the only time in a week of driving around",
          "The full walk can take one out well over a mile towards the Black Cullins. It is a moderately vigorous hike. The pools and multiple small waterfalls are beautiful. A definite must-see on Skye.",
          "There's a \u00a35 charge for parking, but this is so they can build toilets so seems fair. The Fairy pools are stunning area, but can get a bit busy, so get there early. It's not ideal for young children or anyone who isn't too steady on their feet as there's a few burn crossings",
          "A must when in Skye! We had all weathers - and it looked Stunning in all! Mostly flat walk, can go for as long or short as you like. Beautiful as with the rest of this island ! \u00a35 for all day parking at the car park 4 miles away in Cuillan beach - also a must!",
          "These pools are a pretty enough place to visit. Parking charge a bit steep, but blueness of the water is lovely. Watch your step on some of the muddier parts.",
          "As you will see from the photo of the sign we took at the venue, they charge you \u00a35 per car to support in making the environment better for visitors, yet Sept 2019 still no toilets, no information, in fact the whole area was a mess! You have a good walk to the pools, uphill.",
          "We visited on a slightly overcast day and still saw the range of colour in the pools but sure they would have been more impressive on a sunny day. I\u2019m by no means fit but taking the falls gradually was fine. The stepping stones across the streams were helped by a steadying hand",
          "There are plenty of equally stunning places across the Isle of Skye. The place is the land of mountains and waterfalls! My guide said 'if they'd called it the midgie pools, then no-one would come, but they called it the fairy pools and this is what happens.' This walk is",
          "This is free to walk, though you must pay \u00a35 to park. Definitely worth it. It\u2019s beautiful walking down. There are multi-way fairy pools and falls. For those who are brave, you can swim as well. We saw a number of people braving the cold waters, though I\u2019m not that thick skinned.",
          "What an amazing spot, although many more people are visiting than ever,it still manages to retain its peaceful and magical aura. We arrived late morning, the sun was shining, and we just walked around for hours. We parked about \u00bd km away and had no trouble accessing the spot,",
          "The local community is setting up proper (paid) parking and working on toilets & small info point. Parking is already available (5\u00a3), the rest is work in progress. From the parking you can hike up along the river with indeed beautiful pools with crystal clear water. While",
          "We paid \u00a35 to park the car only not to be able to pass over the stream to access the fairy pool walk due to the amount of rain that had fallen! Advice going on a try day",
          "We drove eager to experience the Fairy Pools. We paid \u00a35 to park and walked down. As it had been raining over the past week, the creek which you need to cross was raging. Apparently that morning people had been wading waist-deep to cross it! We watched some people cross it",
          "This was the one spot that I insisted be added to itinerary and I wasn't disappointed! It was not a sunny day but the hike and the vistas were still unbeatable. If you are in the Isle of Skye be sure to make this one of your stops.",
          "the drive there takes a while as it is mostly one lane but it is worth it. the first car park is free and the next one down the bottom is 5 pounds. which i think is very expensive, considering there are no toilets.as you walk to the pools you have to step on rocks in the stream",
          "Photoshopped brochures make you think yes let\u2019s go see amazing that\u2019s the real photos it is worth a walk if you\u2019ve nothing else to do there is lots of little waterfalls like that nothing at all like brochures so don\u2019t be kidded I think they took pictures from a helicopter so",
          "Beautiful natural pools set at the bottom of the Cullin hills...very dramatic setting and make for gorgeous pictures! Its \u00a35 to park up and then about a 40 min walk down and then up to the very top of the largest pools. Very clear waters and turquoise in parts - even on an over",
          "What an amazing spot! There is quite a hike to get there but it's well worth it in the end. The pools just go on and on...so beautiful! Fyi: There are no washrooms there and it's $5 to park but again, well worth it!",
          "We arrived at 5pm and found that we were one of the last to actualy begin hiking out to see the pools which made it quite nice to be alone when we arrived at the pools. It is really nice for taking pictures in the evening light and not having to adjust to get people out of the",
          "Can get very busy ,good size carpark .path up to the waterfall and pools Are ok .can be very muddy at parts .over all nice day out glad we did it",
          "Fell in love with Scotland. Magical fairy pool and the rain didn\u2019t stop us from going there. If you are there, do visit the fairy pool. We bought the day tour from GetYourGuide. Had the most pleasant trip ever with Micheal and Gordon. Gordon was the best guide ever!",
          "One thing to note, as I find with most tourist attractions.. the photos you find online are the best of the best in the most favorable weather. For me it was overcast and drizzling most of the hike.. so I never saw quite the color spectrum seem in some of the photos. But I",
          "This would be a heavenly walk if it wasn\u2019t for all the visitors! The road to the car park (where there is a \u00a35 charge) is a single track lane of about 4-5 miles from Carbost, with passing places and can get quite busy. Once there it is about a 1 mile walk up to the pools. You",
          "Went there today, weather not at its best, no one can be blamed for that, but I did think the \u00a38 charge to park a Motorhome was excessive for what it was, not even any toilets or other facilities!",
          "Went up yesterday.. The car park is not free. You pay 5pound to park your car. We spoke to the parking attendant and he said its \u00a35 so they can get some toilets installed ect. The car park is big enough. We did go at 10am in morning and I'd suggest going as early as possible.it",
          "Definitely a must see! We were blown away by the gentle streams, waterfalls and the sheer magnitude of the land around us.",
          "Gorgeous walk through a meadow along flowing pools of water. I suggest wearing sturdy walking shoes with good traction. It was misting when we went and the rocks you have to walk on across some of the pools can be slippery. It has quite a bit of elevation but was so worth the",
          "We did this trip late afternoon, early evening - you need to cover yourself with insect repellent - smidge is good. The midges were prolific. However, as we went later, we missed the majority of the crowds. You have to pay for car parking and it is relatively expensive.",
          "It was raining a lot the last few days so the calm pools changed in a rough stream. Still a recommendation to visit! The walk towards the pools can be a little challenging when it has rained, but with the proper footwear it is not a problem at all.",
          "We arrived early before it got too busy, it was very muddy, slippy and boggy in places so come prepared with good sturdy footwear, we did chuckle at quite a few people walking in their lovely white trainers and fashion suede boots \ud83d\ude44 We walked all the way to the bottom of the",
          "This location was really neat and magical. In the rainy weather, be prepared to walk thru deep mud and cross a swiftly moving area of water that can be between a foot to two feet.",
          "This area was quiet busy when I went. Nevertheless it was one of the must see sites on the Isle of Skye. Swimming in them is a biblical experience",
          "Lovely walk with fabulous views of Cuillin Mountain range even though weather wasn\u2019t ideal for us it didn\u2019t spoil the experience. Car park charge of \u00a35 I feel was excessive given no facilities yet, even though this fee is supposedly going towards improvements next year.",
          "Well worth the walk, good footwear a must. Gladly paid the \u00a35 parking charge which goes towards providing toilet facilities next year which will be a great addition especially if you have children with you.",
          "Fabulous couple of hours spent walking and looking at the waterfalls. It was a Lovely sunny day. \u00a35 to park your car. It was very busy but plenty of room to enjoy the day. Well worth a trip. A bit steep at times especially on way back to car park.",
          "Took forever to drive there, once there, so much disorganised traffic, no parking for miles. Very disappointed as we came from Australia, and will not be going back for ? How long",
          "This place is just beautiful. Even our 5 teenagers enjoyed it! It took us about 2 and half hours taking it nice and steady and taking in the waterfalls and fairy pools along the way. All I will say is the hill back to the top of the track on the way back was a bit of a killer",
          "There is now a fairly large paid car park which is helping to fund conservation, and to stop people parking on the verges of the single track road. The drive takes a while due to the volume of traffic. The walk up to the pools and back took us around 90 minutes, and is worth the",
          "While the pools themselves are charming and the views are lovely, the overwhelming number of tourists, for which the site is just not prepared, has spoiled the path there as well as the overall atmosphere. Parking is cramped.",
          "once you park your car its about a 2 mile walk up the trail alongside and over small streams , but when you cross the streams be careful the rocks are slick. when you get up to the pools it is just beautiful the way small waterfalls form into these pools. its hard to describe in",
          "Sadly, this was our one disappointment on the Isle of Skye. We went on a day in early August that was cloudy but turned to rain right after we paid to park. In hindsight, I wish I'd paid attention to reviews and had only gone when the sun was out. The parking was fine - 5",
          "After reading the reviews I was doubtful about this place but honestly I enjoyed it and I am quite to the point about things . We arrived early about half 8 as we read parking can be crazy . We didn\u2019t have to pay as there was no one on the hut as it was still closed , the",
          "We got lucky and had a bright midge free day to enjoy this pretty set of small waterfalls and pools. It\u2019s very crowded though, we saw more people here than we e seen anywhere else in Skye. The walk isn\u2019t too strenuous.",
          "We came here quite early in the morning and paid the \u00a35 parking fee. We walked across the street and started the walk to the fairy pools. It was easy walking except for the few times you have to cross the stream on stepping stones. Several people slipped into the freezing water.",
          "Here's the thing. I recommend the Fairy Pools. Yes, you have to pay \u00a35 for parking. Yes, there are hoards of tourists. Yes, there are even more midges. No, there are no toilets or amenities. Still. You should go. They are amazing. You would not miss Florence because",
          "This was a spectacular site! Unfortunately it was raining and the water was too high to cross over and climb up to the top of the waterfalls but was still spectacular. I am 63 years of age and was a little too old to be climbing over slippery rocks, but if the weather was dry I",
          "We really enjoyed our walk up to the fairy pools, we were in a large family group with a dog. We took a short cut from the car park which turned out to be tricky for the less agile, jumping from rock to rock. The views fantastic, and everyone went in for a swim even the dog",
          "very crowded, you can see something like that or even better on the island but not with parking place and walking path.",
          "Lovely trip to the fairy pools. We arrived about 9.30am and the car park (\u00a35 charge) was busy but not full. Midges out in full force! The walk up to the fairy pools is mostly easy as long as you have sturdy shoes as it is a bit slippy/muddy in places. At the beginning of the",
          "Having done the usual and looked at all the amazing pictures of the fairy pools on Pinterest and the internet I was a wee bit excited to visit these clear blue pools. We parked in the second car park available which costs \u00a35.00 for the day. We walked across the road and up",
          "The overcrowded car park in August should give you enough idea of what to expect. Far too many people will ensure you'll get no meaningful experience here so try to time it very early or late in the day or better still, out of season.",
          "Overall the whole experience was terrible. I went with my mum in a trip to Skye. I have been there before, but it was her first time, and I wanted to show her the most iconic places. As I didn't go myself to the fairy pools the last time I was there, I thought it would be a nice",
          "Nice enough walk but it looks nothing like it does in uploaded photos. I think the name fairy pools draws many visitors and encourages photo shopping as it was nothing special and just ok. There are many other better hikes on Skye.",
          "I know I'm a hypocrite because I AM a tourist and was contributing to the problem, but this place really is a victim of its own success. We arrived early-mid morning and the car park was already heaving, You now have to pay \u00a35 but there are currently no facilities. As Scots",
          "The place itself is amazing, a nice river going through waterfolls and natural ponds in the Isle of Skye. Its fame is not-so-slowly killing its appeal, with tourist wandering around like midges in the most annoying way. If you dare bathing in the pool, arm yourself with courage,",
          "This was an easy hike, but the midges and crowds made it difficult to navigate. Parking is 5\u00a3 and plentiful. The path is easy and well marked, but rocky. Once we got above the first few pools it was less crowded, but still a very busy hike. No bathrooms make this difficult to",
          "The fairy pools are a gorgeous location on the Isle of Skye. There is ample parking space, for which a five pound fee is required in CASH. Unfortunately, there are no restrooms yet, but the parking fee contributes towards their construction. From the parking lot it was a 20-30",
          "Maybe it was the weather that made me react like this... crowded place with people going hiking with flip flops or bags from Chanel on paths filled with mud and midges... To summarize this trip...: I met a group of Chinese after 45 minutes of walk who asked me: \u201cwhere is the",
          "The Fairy Pools is an absolute disaster zone now that it has become such a tourist trap and it\u2019s honestly a let down, as well as an environmental catastrophe. The new car park hasn\u2019t solved the overcrowding on the road up from Carbost and the single lane track is now the busiest",
          "Visited here with my American friend who is visiting Scotland for first time. Very disheartening to see how over run by people this spot is. Hundreds of more beautiful places in the Highlands. Muddy and eroded by too many visitors. Midge infested today too, nearly eaten alive",
          "The fairy pools have been really pushed as a visitor attraction in the last few years and the sad result is that the area is now very overcrowded in school holidays and just not worth the effort. Parking is \u00a35 and you then join the hundreds of others along the path and at the 2",
          "A good short hike - nice views and nice cold water. However, there is midges attack in evening - everyone was trying to get them off. Got bitten all over - 100+ bites in 5 mins. So go prepared with mosquito repellents, else it is painful few days!!",
          "Another of Skye's well visited beauty spots, very impressed with the staff at the new car park there, managing the public, sorting parking in a very difficult environment. Special mention for Carol, known as \"keeper of the Fairy Pools\", great organizational skills, and a nice",
          "The fairy pools is a nice site, but please don\u2019t go expecting the turquoise water lagoon at the foot of the hill! If you do so (which we did), you\u2019ll end up walking far more than you should just to reach the bottom of the mountain. It not as breathtaking as the pictures shown",
          "We visited The Fairy Pools on the most perfect dry, sunny day. Of course with this, it was busy, however there is plenty of space for everyone to not feel overcrowded. Due to the crowds, we found a small car park about half a mile from the fairy pools and we walked along the",
          "We really enjoyed looking at the numerous waterfalls and accompanying pools of crystal clear water. Lots to see and the back drop of the mountains is impressive. There are a couple of waterfalls you have to cross over to see them. This makes it difficult for young children and",
          "This review is for the combined trek! The fairy pools were very beautiful but very busy. My husband and I arrived at 9 am, which was a great time, not many people, but by the time we left at noon there was A TON of people. We did the 8 km trek up to the Fairy Pools and around",
          "The experience of walking up to the pools, the scenery around you, and the fresh air, made this a great walk. The walk is not a tough one and can be made at a normal pace, but good walking shoes are highly advisable.",
          "I was looking forward to visiting the fairy pools on our trip to Skye but was left disappointed. Arrived to a car park which charged \u00a35 with no facilities at all. The walk itself was further than we anticipated and not suited to anyone with mobility issues - there were",
          "We loved our visit here and we went swimming in the pools which was a lovely treat. The water was clear and fairly warm considering! It is beautiful. Really beautiful and well worth a visit. But, the road leading to it needs to be improved considering the number of visitors",
          "Went to the Fairy Pools a couple of days ago. The weather was good enough. The site itself however, an utter disappointment. This is the perfect example of a discrepancy between what is and what could have been. The site has been trampled all over by hundreds, if not thousands",
          "Amazing location in perfect weatheras it was warm and sunny.Down side,very busy, so get there early;best side is a fantastic natural series of pools in the most spectacular location.",
          "Went for a wee dip in the pools on a hot day. It's always busy july and August. August seems to be worse then July as Ive Been a few times. Went begining of July. Was able to get a pool to ourselves to have a swim. There is a good path leading to pools but are steeping stones",
          "Long drive to car park and yes it was \u00a35 Take walking boots, water etc, it is a reasonable climb on rocky paths Great photo opportunities and you can keep climbing up hills Was very busy, sometimes photos require patience for people to move on",
          "Fairy Pools are really beautiful. The trek to the pools is also very photogenic. We went in the month of June and it was raining still we could see lots of tourists at the pool. The parking facility is not so good. Due to rains it had become all muddy and puddles everywhere. No",
          "Tha Fairy Pools are amazing but they have been spoiled by the hoards of tourists who visit them. The green banks of the river are so eroded that little of the unique plant life to this area lives on them. They are black and worn with the footprints of tourists taking selfies. We",
          "We visited the place as part of a guided group tour since there is absolutely no public transport here. Our guide warned us that due to the rain the previous day, the water level of the stream we have to cross is higher. This turned out to be true, and we were not suitably",
          "These beautiful cascades are well worth the visit. Pool after pool after pool, cascading into mini waterfalls.... absolutely delightful. A reasonable level of fitness is needed just to walk to the bottom, let alone to venture higher to see more. There had been rain the day",
          "We are from Scotland but hadn\u2019t been to Isle of Skye before. I\u2019d heard the Fairy Pools were overcrowded but part of me wondered if it was really that bad so I went to have a look. AVOID!! The single track road is very busy and it is a stressful experience as most people on the",
          "This was a must do for my wife on our trip to Scotland. Parking was packed, which is normally a good sign. It cost five pounds to park and is well worth it. The hike itself is about 2 miles round trip on a gravel path. Fairly easy walking. There were lots of kids on the",
          "Beautiful spot with dozens of waterfalls, pools and stunning mountain views behind. It's quite a hike down the hill and a long walk if you want to walk all the way in. We only had 45 minutes to visit and it was not enough time. We hardly got started down the path before we had",
          "So beautiful! It\u2019s a long trek but the sights and setting make it very worth the effort. Recommend getting there early in the morning before the heavy crowds show up. Wear good hiking shoes or durable tennis shoes. The trail is not a smooth path.",
          "A visit to the Fairy Pools can\u2019t miss on your itinerary. It is a nice walk/hike along a series of waterfalls and cascades. Depending on what time of year you visit there might be more or less water flowing trough them. I won\u2019t spoil all the beans, you just have to see it for",
          "The surroundings were magnificent! The waterfalls, the mountainsand the soft, hanging clouds! But the walk is pretty good ;)",
          "Looking at pictures on the internet, I thought I was going to see these marvellous magical pools of beautiful colours and feel quite enchanted. The fairy pools are beautiful, but not what I thought they would be. I understand that it was quite an overcast day, but I left feeling",
          "An absolutely stunning place, accessible for all ages, as the steep areas can be easily avoided (or accessed). We've been told that arriving after dinnertime during high season gives you better chances of avoiding the crowds and arriving at around 6pm, we were pleasantly",
          "On our recent trip to we only gave ourselves one day to explore the Isle of Skye. Our first stop was the Fairy Pools. I was a little disappointed we didn\u2019t give ourselves enough time to hike further. The walk wasn\u2019t bad but I do recommend wearing waterproof hiking shoes.",
          "Stop here if you have time, especially if you are blessed with a bright sunny day. There is a pay to park lot near the start of the trail, which was quite full when we arrived. The trail can be a bit rocky and uneven in parts, so hiking shoes/boots recommended. We were there",
          "Good parking, costs \u00a35 but at least you know you will get parked and the money goes back into improvements. The pools are beautiful and look fun to swim in, if you are brave enough! Like most places in skye if you keep walking past the hordes of visitors you are rewarded with",
          "worth the trip. hiking along several waterfalls. 5pnd carpark at the start, thats ok dont waste time finding free carpark couple of miles before (or if you like the extra hike). bring towel! just at the start you might need to go through water ( just up to ankles ) if the water",
          "This is a good, enjoyable walk of approximately 1.5 miles each way. Essential to wear stout walking shoes and clothing which is suitable for a hill walk. The terrain can be extremely wet underfoot and, whilst the path is fairly wide, it is very uneven in parts. There are also",
          "This place used to be so nice but unfortunately it\u2019s a victim of it\u2019s own popularity. Overcrowded and unless conditions are perfect it doesn\u2019t really live up to the hype.",
          "It looks nothing like in the pictures on internet. The scenery around is of course beautiful, but so is the Isle of Skye. Skye has so many scenic places to hike, i don't understand why this one is so popular and overcrowded",
          "A very popular attraction so the car park was relatively full & the trails to the pools very busy. Must say had seen better falls on other parts of Skye so couldn't really understand why is was so busy. Only worth visiting so you can say you've been!!",
          "If you are able to make it to the fairy pools, it is worth seeing. But even int he pouring rain where fording the river early in your path is tough, it is lots of fun exploring the river, which has some drops and unique areas. Pay parking lot here. I'd recommend this is you are",
          "Car parking is \u00a35 per car but there is a large car park which should give an indication of the popularity of the hike. The trail starts the other side of the road. There is no danger of getting lost in fact, it might cause a distraction. Extremely popular with foreigners who are",
          "We were in Scotland for 8 days and it is full of natural trails and other beautiful sights. Therefore we could not comprehend what is the fuss about these \" fairy pools\". It is just another trail with no character which has a stream alongside it. If you are around and about that",
          "I did the Fairy Pools as a day trip out of Inverness with TourSkye and I'm not sure what to say that hasn't already been said. It's enchanting, and even if you have a specified amount of time - for us it was two hours - you can make the most of any amount of time given because",
          "Stunning pools, great scenery, easy parking and worth the fiver. Toilets and cafe being built this month for visitors to use. Other halfwits moan at the parking fee, but would they rather park on grass verges blocking the road for locals and visitors, with their I was here first",
          "I have wanted to do this for a long time and we managed to do this yesterday! We parked in the carpark ( with help from a very lovely lady Carol Jones ) what an asset she is to this site ! We started our walk and I can highly recommend this magical place Simply stunning and",
          "To get to the Fairy pools you need to walk over some stepping stones and jump over some gaps but it makes it part of the fun. It is a lovely walk with a dramatic landscape. The walk back to the car park was a bit tiring! You need to pay towards the car park but this is so funds",
          "This is the only natural wonder we had to pay for on the Isle of Skye and the only one we would skip. We had to pay for parking. Then we had to walk quite a distance and when we got to the stream, it was nearly unpassable. You had to step over rocks which were underwater to get",
          "A bit of a walk to reach the small water falls, pools but worth it. Differing colours are definately visible in the water, but don't expect them to be as vivid as the online representions. There are stepping stones in the water at places, so this isn't accessible for",
          "The fairy pools is one of the most spectacular attraction in the Isle of Skye. They are situated in glen brittle and the water flowing from the cullin mountains forms multiple rocky pools, which if you visit on a fairly sunny day will give the appearance of crystal clear water.",
          "This is definitely one to plan carefully. I have explored the Cuillin mountains a few times but this particular place has been over hyped and the result is more tourists than the roads or place can cope with. Years ago you could skinny dip in these pools and experience a real",
          "One of the most beautiful places I have ever been. It's name definitely matches its scenery. It took my breath away, every fall, every step closer to the mountains was more beautiful than the last",
          "Nice, well maintained walking path but requires crossing a stream on rocks. Beautiful scenery- enjoyed the waterfalls and pools.",
          "Having seen pictures of the Fairy Pools I was expecting amazing colours but clearly the pictures have been photoshopped as the water is normal colour. So many bust trips around even in early evening which dented the romanticism of the backdrop quite a bit. Very narrow road",
          "My husband and I visited the Fairy Pools in June. The car park (\u00a35 per car) was busy and there are no facilities so take a comfort break before you arrive! The pools are pretty but the path was busy, we did nicer walks elsewhere on Skye where there were fewer people. There",
          "Loved the Ferry Pools!!! It was 70 degrees on the fast we stopped by. Parking is 5 pounds. No admission fee. It's a hike... bring good shoes! Plan to spend time, based on weather. One hour if it's cold and you don't go in the water, or if you choose to turn around earlier.",
          "If you\u2019ve seen waterfalls before, these aren\u2019t anything breathtaking (there are even prettier ones just driving around the area), but still a decent walk. It\u2019s very crowded, especially with tourists and motor coaches who have a difficult time navigating the single lane road.",
          "The sights of the pools, especially if the weather is friendly, are worth the trip. In slightly more than an hour you can climb up and see them all. Don't follow up the mountain trail as there are no pools there. Unless you're not looking for them. There will probably be",
          "Be ready to hike, as it\u2019s a bit of a climb to see all of the waterfalls. The water is so clear, and you can climb around the rocks to get amazing views. There is a well-trod trail from the parking lot to show you the way.",
          "Not really fairy but still a really pleasant walk. Strongly suggest to go on a sunny day! Also, note there is no wc anywhere around so make sure you take care of everything you need to before ;)",
          "We visited here in March, two weeks before Easter and the place was packed out. People paid \u00a35 to park their car which is ridiculous in a place like Glen Brittle. We went back up the hill and parked for free in the Forestry Commission car park. The pools themselves are",
          "Most of the isle of skye is very busy but the fairy pools is a destination of choice for many who don\u2019t want to do a difficult hike. As a result this place is crammed full of the older and younger tourists. The car park gets full quite quickly and charges as the other posters",
          "To get to the pools is an approx. 20-30 minute hike up a slight incline. In certain areas, you may need to step from rock to rock over water. Very simple, but obviously not simple with a stroller or a wheelchair. The path itself is rocky not smooth. So you need good walking",
          "You can\u2019t charge \u00a35 to park and direct people to toilet in the bushes where the 5,000 have been before. Disgusting and asking for a serious health issue. Used tissues everywhere..... The walk itself is very nice but invest first and recoup investment second........",
          "A truly magical place! The water in the pools are so clear and of so many different colour shades. Apart from the noise of the waterfalls, it is so peaceful there too. My wife and I loved it. Sadly, we feel that its rapidly increasing popularity is probably going to help it to",
          "The view is incredible and the water is crystalline and very, very cold! I tried myself so you were warned. As I mentioned in the title of this attraction, you must be aware that it is around 5 to 10 minutes driving from the main road, so you must be cautious. The car park was",
          "Well what a place . Very beautiful but overrun with our American and Chinese friends .\u00a35. Parking charge and not even a toilet! Somebody is getting rich 500 cars in may !!!!!! Come on Skye stop this rip off",
          "\u00a38 for parking is slightly on the expensive side. but at least you will be able to find a space but there are no toilets. Short walk from the carpark and beautiful pools to look at but there are some many people I would recommend going either really early or really late.",
          "The pools are beautiful but it's packed with tourists and you don't get to hike and enjoy the landscapes before seeing the pools, it's just a short walk from the road.",
          "Hopefully the pictures will do this place more justice than my words. A must if you\u2019re on Skye. But go early in the day. It gets very busy. Parking (\u00a35 in 2018) is easier too when it\u2019s early in the day. Fantastic walk for dogs and children. Relatively flat walk once you get past",
          "Some of the most beautiful vistas and streams in Scotland. Worth the stop when exploring the Highlands.",
          "This walk and waterfall have been decimated by the volume of visitors (since being renamed the Fairy Pools). Getting in and out by car or coach (the only really viable option since there\u2019s no public transport) is often chaotic as the roads were not built for this amount of",
          "There is now a 5 pound fee to park here, which is fine. There is a constant stream of people. Walk beyond the first (and prettiest) fairy pool to get beyond the crowds. Aside from having to cross a stream using some large boulders, this hike is a breeze. I would have liked",
          "A genuinely lovely set of interconnected pools that cascade down the hillside. You must be ready for the large numbers of people that will be there with you. Although there is a commendable effort to manage the site, the hillside around the pools is heavily damaged by the volume",
          "Nice walk. However too crowded. Not saying i regret visiting, but to be fair, all the pretty pics, you would have to spend like 3 days there to get those. Was more crowded than in edinburgh\u2019s old town. However nice!",
          "This is a beautiful area but plan ahead for washrooms and weather. We visited on a day that rained heavily which meant we had to navigate crossing the creeks with high water since there are no bridges. By late afternoon the water was above the rocks most use to cross the creeks.",
          "Please be aware the water is cold! I was the only idiot on the day I saw In the water however getting your whole body in the cold water is so liberating! DO IT!!! place is a thing of beauty! Car park is charged \u00a35 and you need money they do not accept cards so please be",
          "We visited early morning and car park waa already heaving. There is a car park further away which doesnt have a pay and display. We chose to park nearer and pay \u00a35 ( we knew the children were already in for a good hike ha). The walk was stunning with waterfalls along the way",
          "We paid the \u00a35 parking charge - just hope they can provide some facilities (that are sympathetic to the area) with the money collected. It is a pleasant walk to the start of the falls and if you go a bit further up the path, over some stepping stones, you will find the deeper,",
          "The car park costs \u00a35 but it does go towards important conservation targets, so no grumbles there. If you want to avoid the charge, you could park about a couple of mils prior to the Fairy Pools carpark, but it'll be a long walk back up a steep hill! This is a popular tourist",
          "We arrived early and we were so grateful for doing so. By the time we left the trail along the river was packed. People were everywhere. My recommendation...go early. We hade to pay \u00a35 to park in the lot. Well worth the money. We visited Fairy Pools in May. The weather was",
          "It\u2019s a stream. A nice stream granted but nothing spectacular. And like all things on the Isle Of Skye it\u2019s not worth the drive and the struggle for parking.",
          "Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Fairy Pools are in an area of outstanding beauty at the top of Glen Brittle nestling under the Cuillin Ridge. I also had no objection to paying the \u00a35 for the specially constructed car park as I believe it is being properly reinvested. The walk itself is",
          "Lovely walk spoilt by the amount of people who can,t keep to footpaths and are ruining the flora and fauna and damaging the geology by climbing the banks shame as it is a beautiful area",
          "This place is beautiful from start to finish! Even on a gray, drizzling day the scenery is breathtaking. The hike begins with a gentle downhill for a few hundred yards, then a slow grade uphill for a few miles. Don't let this deter you, though... There is so much to stop and see",
          "We decided to visit the fairy pools when staying in Skye for 24 hrs waiting for our ferry. Very surprised about the lines of people all walking in the same direction. We literally followed everyone in a line . Perhaps the water pressure was low, but the whole experience was",
          "You could tell that the water levels were low so the waterfalls themselves were somewhat underwhelming compared to what was expected. The natural landscape and wildlife was really cool and it was still enough of a hike to break a sweat but not one that had too many limitations.",
          "Well worth the walk down from the car park (\u00a35 - contribution to a development project). Incredible colours on even an overcast day. Bring your trunks and go for dip; gutted we couldn\u2019t!",
          "Free parking for now. No public toilets so be prepared. Was not as easy a walk as expected but still beautiful. The multliple small waterfalls and pools along the way never cease to amaze me with individual beauty. Saw some brave swimmers but too cold for me. We did not do the",
          "This was a good walk which took roughly an hour. We had to pay \u00a35 to park which wad fine as its should go towards building toilets which are much needed.",
          "Visited on a cool but bright day. Parked for \u00a35 and walked to the first pools, this walk is busy but if you keep walking up it gets less crowded and we ended up with a place on our own. Some excellent walks to add on to the visit, we stayed 6 hours. If you are not physically fit",
          "Fun fact: the road coming into this desolate little spot on the Isle is pretty hair-raising (admittedly like many roads out here) so find the parking lot in the pines just shy of the pools. Follow the trail down to the creek (remember to get your bearings so you don\u2019t get lost)",
          "The drier than usual season means the water flow is not huge; nonetheless the walk up and back is worth the views of the pools. I would imagine it is spectacular after rain. 5 pound to park is a rip-off not sure really what you get for that",
          "A lovely climb, not too tough yet a nice afternoon exercise! The amazing views are everywhere....you can hang out and enjoy! One of the few places where there is a parking fee so be sure you have cash on hand (GBP 5).",
          "Finding the place wasn't easy, the signs weren't terribly clear, and parking was ... less than spectacular, giving that there was one small lot, high upon a hill, with perhaps 25 spaces. Everyone else parked along the side of the narrow road, making driving a fun experience.",
          "This place is like another planet. Crystal clear waters, cascading down crags in the earth. Surrounded by huge, imposing mountains. Go a bit further than most, towards the mountain with the crag through it, and you get complete peace. Not a sound. Also, I don't get the",
          "It was suggested to us by a lady at Inverness Airport that we go to the Fairy Pools. She said she had not been there but had heard it was amazing. I am so glad we took her advice as it was stunning. To get there turn off the A87 at Sligachan Hotel and head towards Carbost.",
          "The car park is \u00a35/car aim to pay to improve infrastructure. The walking track is more a hiking trail and is not an easy walk! It requires jumping/leaping and balancing on rocks over rivers. If you are elderly have poor balance and aren\u2019t able bodied this is definitely not for",
          "While a bit of a challenge to find, once there, it was a lovely walk up to these fabulous falls. Great dog friendly trip out in some stunning scenery.",
          "My partner has been desperate to take me to the fairy pools since we first spoke of her previous holidays to Skye over the years. It was, for me, certainly no disappointment. The pools are crystal clear, the rock formations unique and the overall atmosphere quite special.",
          "I certainly am not the type who enjoys a good 5mile hike on weekends or anytime in a matter of fact but the views of the pools matched with the fantastic Cuillin mountains was certainly worth the slow but steady trot. You drive a mile or two on a slightly rocky single track road",
          "This is a stunning natural feature. But they have now decided to put Poles all down the road and make you park on a car park in the middle of nowhere and charge you \u00a35 for the privilege. Extortion at its worst.",
          "We went over the Easter weekend and it was very wet and windy. However it did not put us off and it was worth the walk. It is a little bit hilly in places but is a lovely walk and you can hear the gushing of the waterfalls before you see them. You are walking alongside the",
          "Great walk. There is a good car park (\u00a35) willingly paid for this as it helps fund the upkeep of this natural beauty spot. Walk up to the pools is lovely but most people then just returned the way they came but there are walks around the area around the edge of the cuillins.",
          "Mountains had a dusting of snow which made them even more attractive in the afternoon sun. A pleasant walk down (and up), to see the pools",
          "Heard so much about the Fairy Pools so on this visit decided to do the walk. It was a fine day and not too arduous. Lots of other people had the same idea.\u00a35 to park the car. Nice hour or so adventure.",
          "We visited on Easter weekend. We arrived around 5pm so it has started to get a bit quieter so the single road track wasn\u2019t so bad as we didn\u2019t need to stop and let cars past as often. Car parking is \u00a35 which goes into the community. The fairy pools are about a 15 minute walk",
          "Took us very long to get there. We wanted to include it on our way to Portree but went mad when we arrived, had to pay for parking, and had to walk at least half an hour to get there... People who can\u2019t walk that long (twice to get back) don\u2019t go. And there\u2019s lots of people when",
          "I stayed in the fairy pools for about an hour they were so relaxing. It is a good bonding time for you loved one or your family.",
          "We visited Fairy Pools on a cloudy day and followed the single track road to the very busy car park. (\u00a35 charge) The area is very hilly so wouldn\u2019t be great for anyone with mobility issues and you\u2019d struggle with a pram. The pools are beautiful and I imagine they\u2019d be nice to",
          "About 2 weeks ago I wanted to take friends of mine to the walk around the forestry plantation in Glenbrittle. As we came closer to the Fairy Pools I told my friend to park on the first car park we came across and wich I remembered from my visit a year ago. We grabbed our",
          "An easy hike with some spectacular waterfalls and pools. Good walking shoes are advisable plus water and snacks would be good too. We did this walk with a 11 year old and a 13 year old and they loved it. Climbing over the rocks and being adventurous was completely up their",
          "I think we found the drive there and the view of the Cuillin to be our favourite part of this visit. The pools are great and it is fun to explore them all. But the scenery is just beautiful.",
          "Had an amazing time walking by the pools and swimming in them. Very beautiful but unfortunately very crowded, frustrating to see that some people had just thrown their rubbish in the water, not much but even one piece of rubbish is too much to me. Really enjoyed swimming in the",
          "A great place to visit with family, there is a large paid car park, it says \u00a35 to pay to the attendant. Very popular. The walk is not difficult. You essentially walk upstream and you/;; see about 13 waterfalls poring each into its own pool. The water is quite deep and absolutely",
          "This is a great afternoon activity for families. The scenery is to die for and it\u2019s a fun hike for the whole family. The full walk took around 45 minutes there and the same back. It can be a little bit long for smaller kids but we managed it with some packed lunches! Would say",
          "Exhilarating hike on a very sunny, windy day! The single road drive to the car park was easy and beautiful. The car park is a new addition which I believe is a wonderful idea. The fee to park is only 5 pounds and helps improve and keep the area from failing. Wear good shoes and",
          "The views are amazing! It\u2019s a lovely walk from the car park (which looks like is being improved and pay and display installed -\u00a35- but no facilities there yet) the pools were amazing, such crystal clear water. We actually did a a longer 8km circular walk by continuing past the",
          "Definitely worth the visit, it was slightly cloudy the day we went so the pools weren't at their full glory but still beautiful. Highly recommended, parking not the best but to be expected. They should put barriers up to stop camper vans and vehicles over a certain size as",
          "Best to arrive as early as possible to avoid the crowds later. It is a VERY popular location. There's now a car park which costs \u00a35 per car and a newly created footpath which leads to the pools. All profits go back into the local community. Well worth a visit because there",
          "No words can describe how beautiful and relaxing the Fairy pools are! There is a \u00a35 charge for car park then a good 15mins walk to the actual pools(Not suitable for wheelchairs/prams) Loved out time at the pools and will definitely return again.",
          "Loved visiting the fairy pools. Nature is a mystery. Crystal clear water. Would highly recommend a visit to the fairy pools",
          "Loved this, a long walk, but even with a 3 year old, who done extremely well, it was not too taxing. Exposed to the elements, so make sure you are prepared for the famous Scottish weather! Have a lot of battery power, as you will be taking loads of photos!!",
          "The \u00a35 car park fee is a bit of a rip off. The climb and view was great. Definitely need to be fit and steady on your feet as some parts require using stepping stones to cross the burns. Its a definitely been there seen that but will probably not return.",
          "We visited fairy pools yesterday, I had read about car park charges so was prepared for this but thought it meant there would be facilities but it was just a bit of gravel that was been charged for. Nice 20 min walk to the mini falls. The scenery was lovely and once you got to",
          "Single track road to get there but totally worth it! Views are incredible. There is a car park but not me it\u2019s \u00a35 to park which we didn\u2019t realise so bring cash. If you don\u2019t have cash you can make a donation of \u00a35 online which is what we did.",
          "The place is amazing. Is totally recommended to visit. The problem first is the 5 pounds that you have to pay for park your car. And then, the path... You have to jump down the rocks and cross rivers! Think in the people with reduced mobility. put a wooden bridge come on!",
          "Our first visit to the Isle of Skye and we thought we would visit the fairy pools. It was a lovely sunny day so set out from Balmacara. When we arrived at the carpark an over excited tourist (what we thought) jumped in front of the car. We then discovered that this man was",
          "Nice to walk around this water stream and small waterfalls. Honestly fairy pools in reality doesn\u2019t look like photos you may find in google as it depends on good lighting that hard to find in this part of Scotland. However it\u2019s good walk that may take around 2 hours if you take",
          "This attraction is totally undeveloped and was more hassle that it was worth. Long single track road to get there, ripped of for a fiver to park in the middle of nowhere, very little signage or warnings as you have to cross a burn which in the rain is quite hazourdous, another",
          "So excited to see the Fairy Pools - what a let down. Route to the Fairy Pools rough and ready - no assistance. Crossing the burns could be made safer - a few well placed boulders would be ideal - for the older visitors.. We did not see anything that was advertised re the Fairy",
          "A little surprised to be paying to park in the 'middle of nowhere' but understandably car parking facilities require to be developed to deal with the most welcome increase of tourist interest in Skye and Scotland in general. The walk is well worth the parking charge and the",
          "A lot of people seem to be disappointed by the Fairy Pools, expecting them to be extra magical. Really they\u2019re just a series of pools and waterfalls, which I thought were beautiful just as they are. The walk to the pools is actually mostly uphill and involved crossing some",
          "This is one of those unique places in the world, beautiful and relatively unspoiled. The backdrop of the rugged peaks behind the sparkling pools and burbling falls is glorious and serene. Watch out though, it's a decent walk and they're hardly undiscovered (crowds) and parking",
          "This is a must see on Skye, it really is stunning and when you start to see the first pools and waterfalls they take your breath away. From the car park (a small charge to park) it's a straightforward walk straight into the heart of the pools. We were there for around an hour",
          "I had read that this popular beauty spot was being overwhelmed with visitors cars, but was very pleased to find that the local community have raised the funds to create a large car park, which should greatly ease the previous congestion. They now charge \u00a35 to park, with the",
          "I was so happy that we decided to make the treck from Fort William to the Fairy Pools for a day! Even though the weather was not very nice, the hike was beautiful and the water was crystal clear and the water was such a pretty blue/emerald color. The hike itself is not very",
          "My favourite place in Skye! The most beautiful scenery and the pools are incredible. Even though it was a torrentially rainy day, it was so beautiful. Really worthwhile place to visit. The walk is easy enough with a bit of jumping over streams on rocks, so be aware of that.",
          "Was quite disappointed that an English 'local' wanted to charge us \u00a35 to park. He was moaning about the number of tourists spoiling the place. Seems strange that the money from visitors and tourism are wanted and needed yet not the people themselves. You cant have your cake and",
          "The crystal clear water in the fairy pools makes them look very inviting, even in March! This must be overrun with tourists in the Summer.",
          "not a hard trail to the small waterfalls and clear blue&green cold pools, no climbing. 2 or 3 times needs crossing mountain river jumping the stones, good if no raining - otherwise can be slippery. Magnifisent views, trail for patient slow travellers :)",
          "My wife and I enjoyed the fairy pools at Glen Brittle very much indeed. We were lucky with both the weather and low numbers of people present off season. The car park needs stage 2 completing, so toilet facilities will become available and we felt \u00a35 for parking was a bit much",
          "We did not go all the way down to the pools as it was raining hard BUT that did not stop others. The road to the pools was lined with parked cars and the official car park was full. There are plans to extend this carpark. Its a well-marked path and the pools can be seen in",
          "When my partner told me he was thinking of taking us on a trip to the Isle of Skye I was so excited because I have always wanted to see the Fairy Pools, my excitement was perhaps a little premature as actually a lot of the places in skye were basically inaccessible because we",
          "We went on a wet and cold day. But didn\u2019t regret it for an instant. Stunning natural beauty. Still seems clean and free from the plastic pollution I\u2019ve seen at other Skye Higlights. Take decent footwear if it is wet as the rocks are slippery.",
          "The fairy pools are beautiful. Magical even. The hike is a bit streneous though. I\u2019m not very agile and had a hard time crossing the rivers using the stepping stones. It was worth the hike but might not be for everyone.",
          "Overall, we found the Isle of Skye breathtaking and fantastic. The Fairy Pools were not as interesting as we had hoped. The backdrop was dramatic but it's really just a trail next to a stream. Perhaps it was because of a rainy day but it was not a colorful nor particularly",
          "This place didn't look like much from the parking lot/road, but the hike was quite beautiful, with the stream/river/falls ever changing along the walk. It was cold and rainy, but still enjoyable.",
          "Great walk. Unsure how far to walk so just walked for a couple of hours then turned around. Fantastic views and waterfalls etc. Parking costs \u00a35 cash.",
          "If you visit Skye you have to visit the Fairy pools, the location is stunning, and the walk is lovely, and not challenging. There are loads of little streams and waterfalls, the stepping stones in the stream is also a nice touch. The actual pools are stunning, the colours are",
          "If you come in winter time your boots are very important. The crossing (stone steps) of the small river at the entry of the aerea will be under water (minimum 10cm/ 3inch). At the top end of Fairy pool you stay in front of Cullin Mountins. Come early - less visitors. A must have",
          "Really a beautiful place to visit. It was overcast on the day I went so the colour of the water wasn't the vivid blue you see on the postcards, but still a stunning part of the island and you could see that the pools and waterfalls would be magical in the sunshine. It's a",
          "What a wonderful place. Totally ruined by the \u00a35 parking charge and an incredibly ruide parking attendant!!!!!! Skye is being ruined by greedy people. Such a shame that such a beautiful place left us with such a bad taste in our mouths",
          "Fairly easy walking EXCEPT if you are short legged hopping the river crossings in 2 places, can be a challenge. I recommend wearing waterproof boots and walking across the water. 50% of the people crossing fall off the rocks, so don\u2019t chance it.",
          "On the way to the pool, google Maps will tell you to take the right turn, don't make the same mistake we did, continue on the road to your left, you'll see a bunch of cars parked on the side of the road. It's worth the walk and most of the walk is easy as is flat. Wear hikers",
          "Absolutely stunning. There was 3 of us and we weren\u2019t particularly fit and we did it in very cold conditions. It\u2019s free at the moment but they suggest a \u00a35 donation for parking which is going towards building a visitor centre. Fantastic views, must go!",
          "Lovely place for a morning stroll \u00a35 parking not far away. Lovely walk, a clear footpath to follow or you can venture off.",
          "Nice walk it takes nearly 1h30 to reach the end of the path;small waterfalls, nice little water pools and the Hebrides landscape.",
          "We enjoyed our walk and exploring the fairy pools! I think because we'd seen amazing photos online we assumed it would be more spectacular and kept walking thinking we'd see more. But it was worth it for the walk and to see all the waterfalls. It was just a little anticlimactic.",
          "Not recommended for folks short of breath as on the way back, there's a major uphill climb. There's a lot of running water, amazing photographic shots, fun for drones, anything really.",
          "I've been to Isle of Skye 3 times this year and only got to visit the fairy pools on my last visit. I'd asked a few locals what they're like and it's always been a pretty average response... but I thought they were fantastic! Its a really lovely walk to see them - wear wellies",
          "A long walk .... loved it !! Magical! Clear water BUT can be quite muddy .... need to get early because the car park is full and the road leading to it ... but once there..... you\u2019ll love it",
          "A \u00a35 charge to park at a natural beauty spot is rediculous and is spoiling Skye! What a shame, left a bitter taste.",
          "I agree with everything that has been said. The place is delightful. The disappointment was that the previously free car park was patrolled by a volunteer who insisted we coul not park unless we made a charity donation of \u00a35. Now I have no problem with making donations and",
          "Was gray and overcast the day we went, but still a beautiful place, nice walk. Would be special on a sunny day.",
          "We visited the pools on a bright cold day in November. Well worth a look. The first of the pools are found after a 20 minute walk from the car park. Continue on and the waterfalls and pools don\u2019t disappoint! Time and money is being spent on improving parking and toilet",
          "If ever in Isle of Skye, the walk along the Fairy Pools is beautiful. Not too tiring and very serene and scenic. I drank from the stunningly fresh, clear water. Sparkling blues and greens \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfde\ufe0f\u2728",
          "Bit of a walk to get to these .. and a few jumping over the water on stones ... there is a car park .. that costs not sure how much ... but worth a visit as it is stunning scenery ..",
          "Perhaps I'd gotten my hopes up too much, but I expected more. Or perhaps it was because it was incredibly busy and there was a guy in a speedo jumping in and out of the water that just kind of ruined the magic. If we were in the area we'd probably go again, but in the hopes that",
          "If your on the Isle of Skye you can't miss the Fairy Pools! There is a local organization which is charging money for parking so they can make improvement such as bathrooms so its a good cause. The walk to the first of the pools takes about 20 minutes and from there on up",
          "On a beautiful day, truly not to be missed. In the rain, it could be a little sporty. Likely delightful on a hot summers day, on a sunny afternoon in late October it gave us the opportunity to stretch our legs and enjoy the Scottish countryside. It\u2019s a little off the beaten path",
          "Had to pay \u00a35 to park in either car park , told it would take 45 minute walk but there were bad & dangerous crossing to get over . You need good walking boots on , steep rocky hillside to get down . Rocky paths to go along & stones to hop over the burns slippery when wet . We",
          "We visited in September after some rain and the stream was running high with the stepping stones almost covered. Some people made it across but many others (ourselves included) decided against crossing. My friend was concerned about her stability and, while I had proper hiking",
          "Great spot to visit on Skye. Beautiful scenery. Dress for rain from pop up showers. Parking can be tricky, the lot gets full quick but you can park along side of the road but be careful b/c its a single track road. You need to have good mobility b/c its a hike and there are",
          "I think there are nicer prettier spot if you ask around and do the drives. They are building a cafe and newnparking so should help crowding",
          "We spent the day hiking in the area of the fairy pools. We got to the first area where the waterfalls were raging so we could not cross without our regular gear. We did spent enough time near the streams and first falls to enjoy the exercise and the weather. We will be back to",
          "Some people go for a swim here but in June, it was too cold to get in the water. Scenery was pretty but it's not as spectacular as other scenery on this island. Water wasn't pretty turquoise color or anything special. A lot of photos are taken here and they must have been",
          "It had been raining a fair bit in the days proceeding our visit. So the river was HIGH and to get across you had to wade through the flowing water. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but actually added to the whole experience! Our group got over, but unfortunately we saw many others",
          "A .car park has been established to try to alleviate the tourist congestion here at a \u00a35 cost per car which is well worth it to save the single track road around the attraction. Even on a wet October day there were a large number of visitors. Luckily the car park attendant",
          "And the weather was awful but you can still see the colours and it\u2019s not such a great hike just a bit slippy on the stepping stones wouldn\u2019t attempt it without decent footwear. Parking not so bad this time of year",
          "Visited today and cannot quite believe what this island has become. Been coming here for 25 years and never thought we would have to dodge crowds, many of whom are here purely in pursuit of that perfect Instagram shot without any interest or respect for the local history or",
          "Went there and was simply magical. Tip: go around 16/17 hour. The sky is just right then. The picture attached is a picture that has not been retouched.",
          "On arriving we managed to find a car park although the cost was horrendous. Unfortunately we didn't realise the walk to the fairy pools was longer than we had anticipated so we didn't get there. If you are going then allow a couple of hours to enjoy the walk and scenery. The",
          "Managed to get a space in the car park, but other cars were parking up the side of the road, it was very busy. Nice walk up to the pools, our 5 year old managed fine. Weather was a bit dull so fairy pools weren\u2019t as sparkly as I think they\u2019d have been in sunshine, but still",
          "Lovley, absolutely gorgeous. Worth every second. They are working on getting a better parking, toilets and a cafe.",
          "Worth the walk and rain showers. Truly a fairies playground. Go early or late to avoid the midday crowds.",
          "Such a beautiful spot. Highly recommend water proof shoes as there are some water crossings and it can be a bit boggy near the edges where you can get the best views of the falls and pools. It\u2019s 5 pounds for parking at the car park but well worth it for the scenic walk.",
          "While staying in the Isle of Skye we went on a trip to see the Fairy Pools. it was a long trek and i dont think we got to see them all but what we did see were stunning and the scenery from there was great too. ideal if you like photography. Lost count how many pools we saw",
          "We visited in October and as they are developing a new car park they are charging \u00a35 to park which I don\u2019t think is unreasonable. The parking attendants were very pleasant and chatted about our stay. I would recommend walking boots as the ground in uneven muddy and very wet in",
          "We visited on a wet day so waterproofs are required as the walk to the pools is about 2kms over a rough track.. If it has been raining heavy the stream you have to cross can be a bit of a tricky task so be careful on wet rocks. The walk is certainly worthwhile as fairy pools is",
          "We are so pleased we visited the fairy pools it was an easy walk from the car park. It was quite busy but this didn\u2019t spoil the experience.",
          "Beautiful place, with stunning scenery. You need sturdy shoes as it is quite a climb on stony paths with a few stepping stones to jump over. Not suitable for anyone unsteady on their feet or for pushchairs. As you climb there are lots of beautiful waterfalls, clear blue rock",
          "So much beauty in one place. Crystal water with turquoise color, pools, small waterfalls and lots of magic.",
          "We weren't sure what to expect, but wow. So beautiful. Be sure to allow a lot of time, as the pools go for a bit. Most people stay to the lower part. Also, it is a bit of a hike, so wear good shoes and take some water if you aren't in the best shape. Parking can be tricky, but",
          "Went to see these beautiful pools of green and blue Crystal clear water. Well worth the effort on foot up hill to get there",
          "We were told the fairy pools were a must visit but get very busy, so we chose to go in the early evening. There's an initial walk from the car park and then you steadily go upwards (gentle incline) with the pools alongside you. I wasn't sure what to expect, it's like a big",
          "When you are on your way here - it is a one lane track with passing areas. Unfortunately, many tourists decided to park on the passing areas to avoid paying a fee to park which caused some traffic issues. Please don't be one of those people or if you are may your rental car get",
          "I saw a picture on Pinterest of the fairy Pools on the Isle of Skye and had to see them for myself. It was on my bucket trip list of things to see. It did not disappoint! We walked all the way to the top of the falls and fairy pools were stunning! Some of the most spectacular",
          "Best thing to do is get here early, we did and we didn\u2019t even have to pay for parking because we beat them there! Was nice and quiet only three other groups of people think it was about 8ish we got there? Nice walk we managed it easily and my husband had our 1y/o on his back and",
          "Car park full and not very large-payment demanded. Road side for miles around full of parked cars despite no parking on verge signs. Gave up seeing any pools of water close up.I don't remember seeing any at all in past from several visits over 50 years! Man made tourist",
          "A delightful walk down the stony footpath from the car park (\u00a35) then over numerous stepping stones over ditches and brooks up to the picturesque mini waterfalls. You pass many small pools (Fairy Pools) en route. A good and at times challenging walk so you need to be relatively",
          "The river shines in beautiful colours and the landscape around it is stunning as well. However, it is a really wet area (kinda obvious I know) if you have rubber boots, bring them. Its a lot easier to cross the river. Also, we got terrorized by midges (tiny mosquito-like",
          "My partner and I went for a day out and although getting slightly lost finding our way, the place was absolutely beautiful. It wasn\u2019t too busy and with us getting there at 17:00 we thought that it would be too dark to see it properly but we were in luck! Would definitely go",
          "We tried to make this visit in 2015 and could not get across the first stream. This time we did manage to walk across the two streams, jumping from rock to rock. We are older it was difficult. Our friends could not do the second stream and had to turn back. No problem for the",

          "I found the first one and as it was getting dark and the shortest full route was a half hour I had to cut my visit short and did not get back to it. but really really wanted to and will seek it out if I get to Scotland again. The one alone was gorgeous.",
          "We arrived a bit late, so the crowds had dimmed. Still plenty of people around, and you could tell there had been many visitors that day due to the muddy footprints. Definitely wear your hiking boots and take some water. The water sparkles, and if you take a moment, you swear",
          "We love to hike and had looked forward to this strongly-promoted trail. However, it was overrun with people and their dogs. There are other equally beautiful trails that are more enjoyable if you\u2019re looking for some degree of solitude. If you go, pay for the parking in the lot",
          "The Fairy Pools are a beautiful walk particularly in the morning. This site is attracting an increasing number of tourists so it can get very crowded. We visited early in the morning and the paid parking was not full at this time (5\u00a3) for parking which is off the road. The area",
          "This was a tiny bit disappointing only because the weather just made it tougher. Water was rushing so it upped the wetness factor and I\u2019d hesitate if traveling with anyone who may have issues crossing rushing water. It wasn\u2019t the most enjoyable but it is definitely beautiful.",
          "Visited here with children aged from 1-11 with our dog. Car park was absolutely full up but managed to find space. Lots of people of all ages on the walk. Beautiful backdrop of the black Cuillin mountains behind and the river was very clear and beautiful. We dipped out feet in",
          "We came at 8:45 am on a Tuesday (September 25). It started out very very windy. There is a parking attendant at the Parking Lot charging 5 GBP. We paid him and walked across the street to the trail. The trail isn't very difficult and we finished in 2 hours. There is a",
          "We went here on a some what rainy day but this is part of what's to be expected in Skye. Parking is quite a feat in spite of a recently opened parking lot. The scenery was absolutely breath taking and we must have taken over 150 photos. I have read other reviews where posters",
          "I would say go see it to satisfy curiosity if you are on Skye but don't travel there just for this. It's ok but it's just a couple of little waterfalls. Not that much different than the ones you can see every 2 miles driving around the highlands from the road without the long",
          "After being told by the manager of the campsite we were staying at that it wasnt really worth the trip, we set off anyway. The roads were fine with plenty of passing places. The parking around the area is poor to say the least especially for the time of year. It looks like",
          "For once the weather behaved itself and we visited the Fairy Pools. There are no parking signs for the grass verges and passing places, but people ignored this.

          "Loved the fairy pools, everything it promised to be! It\u2019s a great walk up, the pools are amazing the view around are spectacular! Definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re in Skye",
          "Ok car parking can be a bit difficult, but this is a major tourist attraction. As of Saturday when we visited it looks l8ke they are extending the car park. For the car park to the top of the fairy pools is about 2.4 mile walk. Some soft ground and crossing couple of streams. So",
          "Visited the Fairy Pools and the sun was shining! The pools were clear Beautiful hills and mountains surrounding the area. It was a nice walk. Waterfalls along the pools. We loved it! The colors were lovely!",
          "For photographers the Fairy Pools offer so classic images for a trip to the isle of Skye. A small car park is found opposite a well tended walkway down to the river and a succession of pools and inlets forming waterfalls and features. The initial part of the walk is not to steep",
          "You could easily spend hours here! When you first arrive you start on this road which looks down where you walk, at first you don't think much at all but as soon as you start walking you uncover all these beautiful pools! No saftey rails so you can adventure as much as you like",
          "Rented a cottage on Skye with spectacular views towards the Cuillins, did a walk every day even though it was raining and windy, still spectacular scenery. A walk from Sligachan to Glen Brittle over the hill was fabulous, great track to walk on until the path led us down to the",
          "Make sure you have the appropraite foot wear, hiking boots and water proofs preferably as when it rains, it rains in torrents. The scenery is breathtaking and you must take a camera. Single track road with passing places to get there but well worth it. Plenty of parking along",
          "I\u2019m giving five stars, not for the pools but for the surrounding mountains / scenary. We came early when there was no one and the pools honestly didn\u2019t look very special. I liked the surrounding mountains that were tall and majestic and provided shade as we walked along the",
          "It is a narrow one vehicle wide road with pullouts that takes you down to the fairy pools. Small parking lot at bottom for \u00a35, free parking on roadway, then second parking lot further up road and a bit of a walk down. We arrived around 4 pm and found parking easily on road. It",
          "visited on 08/09/18 It was reasonably easy to find your way to the fairy pools by road and 'by god ' you sure knew when you had arrived.........people and cars everywhere. We counted the cars in what we thought was going to be a quiet peaceful place and we were still counting",
          "If you park in the car park in the road to Glen Brittle and then walk to the top you literally see some of the most outstanding natural beauty in the world. The only thing I'm dissapointed about is not jumping into a pool from a height. I just needed to see one other person do",
          "Went up end of August expecting it to be a bit quieter but was still really busy. There is no free parking except on the side of a single track road witj cars lined up down one side which ends up being really tricky to head back. You can however turn in the car park and the",
          "Lovely place, but far too many people. Saw more people (and midges) in our quick walk up than in our entire week in the Cairngorms... Good start to longer climbs though, once you are a mile in the tourists fade away.",
          "Fairly easy to find with lots of parking available, but it does get pretty busy. The walk is clearly marked and takes the best part of an hour to reach the end. Some river crossing & muddy footpath so wear walking boots. Long sleeves & trousers are a must as the midges are out",
          "It took us a little while to find this place and once we did parking was a little tough. But we parked and walked up the the pools - take your time- it\u2019s so pretty! You can also go in the pools but they are pretty rocky!",
          "We opted to take the Coire na Creiche trail clockwise around to the Fairy pools. Fairy pools were a bit of a let down after the magnificent scenery the hike offered. Visited on a cloudy/rainy day so the colors we had seen in pictures were not there. Parking is INSANE so be",

          "We went on a dreary day in may, despite the rain the walk was stunning. I think when walking you really have to appreciate just how stunning and fairy tale the landscape is. I would highly recommend the walk, although it may not be suitable for young children as some of the",

          "We visited on a day which was very wet and windy but it was worth the soaking...even in full waterproofs... as a result of the rain the pools were stunning and well worth the visit. The Cuillins looked very moody in heavy mist and added to the atmosphere.",
          "Luckily, the fairy pools were near our BnB, so we stopped. Came at about 6:30pm and it seemed slightly less busy. The walk is easy overall with a few tricky parts (hopping from rock to rock). The waterfalls and pools are beautiful - then again, so is most of the scenery on Skye!",

          "I visited the fairy pools with my family in August 2018. It was nearly impossible to park and the walk down was very steep. It was ok for me, but when I looked online it said the walk was mostly flat. I thought this would be a good place for my mom, who is disabled, to visit",
          "This is a nice and special sighting of Skye. We finally managed to come through despite a troublesome parking chaos. There are not enough official parking spots which results in everybody parking on the side of the one lane road. So for approx one mile you are met by a couple",

          "This would have been a glorious walk, however like many other people we arrived mid afternoon and it was packed. Half naked screaming tourists in the pools was off putting. Parking was also challenge. My advice is get here early or find another nice walk. We did some less",

          "Save yourself \u00a35 and park well in at the side of the road. A short track up and down snd over a few streams you get to the fairy pools. They are very pretty (if you are brave enough you might paddle). Even though they are a popular tourist spot they are well worth the visit.",
          "They are building a 130 space car park, but until then, most people park on the road side which causes a real jam of cars (see photo). Walk to the falls (and beyond) is full of viewpoints and photo opportunities. There are a couple of stepping stones / wading sections to cross",
          "After the hyoe and photis on websites when we vusited we were a bit underwhelmed by the pools. It is a nice walk but crowded with people and midgies. Have better pools where i live with many fewer people and less walking",

          "Wasn't anything like what I was expecting but it was gorgeous. We got there early so while very few people, we still had to park on the road. It was an easy, meandering walk down the hill and then up again to the top.The falls were breathtaking. Could have spent much more",
          "A decent walk down to them if you park in the top car park, then a decent walk to the top of the falls, but so worth it, really are gorgeous, it rained heavily on our visit and would imagine on a brighter day would certainly be breathtaking. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Absolutely beautiful spot. Great place to take children. You could easily spend a day there on a lovely day. Be careful though the rocks in the water are really slippery! At present there are no toilet facilities at the car park but I believe they are expanding the car park and",

          "Beautiful pools, one after the other, winding their way between the hills. Lots of stepping stones and tiny pools and waterfalls. Its quite a walk so come prepared, although its not as steep as it looks on the way back. We went in relatively low season but it was busy, so get",

          "Fairy pools was the first thing we drove over to, about 3pm/4pm, after getting onto Skye and by that time it was pretty overrun and hard to take any magical looking photos or really appreciate it with so many people around, so I'd say (like most places on Skye) got early if you",
          "Only if you pass by, the weather is good (better sunshine), it's not an evening and there are no crowds of tourists ... But if weather is good, it worth climbing a little bit to see a wonderful blue in the water, even pushing through the crowd of tourists. If you love and can",
          "My visit was on a rainy day and I thought I would visit anyway as I thought it would be quite due to the weather, I was wrong. Very busy and car park was full. There is space along the roadside which is where I parked. I found the walking fairly easy as there wer no what I would",
          "Lovely place to visit but would recommend getting there early (8.30am) to get great photos with less people around.",
          "This hike, though lovely, was spoiled for me because it was crawling with hoards of people, even in the driving rain. It was a complete tourist trap.",
          "Nice hike to the pools and it was good to read prior comments to go early...even in the rain it was packed when we were walking out. Go early!!",
          "Finding this walk is easy its right off the road, parking is busy and so be prepared to park road side. This is not a strenuous walk nor very long but it is a nice walk along the river with the fairy pools to view. Worth the visit for a couple of hours.",
          "In short, this felt like the place everyone had to go because everyone was going there. There was a non-stop stream of people heading to and from the overcrowded parking lot. The trail was a wreck. The creek and pools were pretty but not spectacular. If I had to do it again",
          "Parking a little difficult at busy times, but a new car park is currently being built. If you feel like a good walk, you can carry on past the fairy pools and up into the mountains. We went in the evening on our way back to Glen Brittle Campsite. It\u2019s a nice walk to the",
          "It was cold, rainy and windy when we went but it was all a great experience for my children who live in Dubai. We walked 8K along side all the beautiful water falls and pools. Even my 5 year old loved and only got tired when we almost reached the clouds. We got there early",
          "The hike is great, suitable for beginners with young kids, not too difficult. The scenery is amazing and the water is beautiful. The only downside is getting there via the narrow roads with passing places, and parking is a bit difficult. Also there are no public toilets nearby.",
          "The pools are simply beautiful!! Get there early, 8-9ish and you'll not only get a parking spot but you'll have the pools pretty much to yourselves. We spent about 2.5 hrs admiring the views, and even had quick swim. Granted it was very cold but you did get used to after a",
          "Not sure if it was due the rain but nothing to see here is what we got. Maybe better on a clear day but if its raining heavily dont waste your time..head straight to Talisker!",

          "Beautiful view and beautiful hike. You must use rocks to cross creeks once in a while making it a challenge for anyone with physical limitations. My daughter swam in the fairy pools which looked a little intimidating to me but there were several people doing it. They were so",
          "Stunning location, nice easy walk. Well worth doing. Just watch the stream crossings as they can get a bit slippy, not good for OAPs that aren't mobile",

          "Didn't know what to expect as I read pluses and minuses of the fairy pools. After going and hiking to them I have to say that they were amazing! It was a little more challenging of a hike then I would have expected but well worth it. Not tons of crowds when we were there and",
          "A return visit after I visited 2 years ago during the day and found it absolute chaos. the approach roads were choked with traffic with people blocking the passing places and abandoning vehicles at the side of the road. There are a couple of car parks near by but they cant cop",

          "So I'm not gonna lie, I expected more. I'd seen incredible photos with amazing colors and was really hoping to see something magical. Not that nature itself isn't magical, but basically what I saw were blues and greens. I thought there would be more variety in the landscape and",

          "This is a very popular place to visit. Visit very early or very late (since it really doesn't get dark in the summer). The pools are crystal clear and on a hot day many take a dip. The refreshing sounds of the large and small waterfalls are good therapy after a lot of travel",

          "Yes the pools are beautiful, but you really need to take your time to take and later edit your photos to make them look like advertised. As for the location - you really don't need to go till the end, the furthest point with rocks and waterfalls that you can see from the parking",
          "A good long walk or hike to the pools, but they are amazing. There is a steep grade on both ends because you walk down into a valley and then back up to the pools. But they are crystal clear and blue.",
          "As tempting as it may be to do a \u2018quick\u2019 visit here or join a whirlwind trip around the island, you really need a couple of hours here to truly soak up the beauty of this place. It\u2019s especially gorgeous on a misty, cloudy day!",

          "The fairy pools are something that should not be missed when visiting. A long narrow track takes you down to these amazing pools. Are you brave enough to take a dip? I wasn't as it was a bit chilly but my dogs loved it swimming around in these very deep pools. In fact the canvas",

Amazing to see many people of all ages making the same journey. If you are not in shape BEWARE. Isle of Skye is",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by the fairy pools. They where the main reason my other half wanted to visit skye but I was not sold until we got there. The water is some of the bluest and clearest I have ever seen and would liken it to something you would see in the south america",
          "Long hike over rocky terrain for some unimpressive waterfalls. No toilets at the parking area. Wasted 2 or 3 hours that would have been better spent in Elgol. Young people who want to bathe in an icy stream might enjoy this place, but it's a big disappointment for everyone",
          "What a beautiful place to visit in Skye The water is the strangest colour of blue and it is truly breathtaking with all the pools. Of course it is pretty to look at, but one should swim in the pool which I did and it was so refreshing. The walk to reach the fairy pools was",

          "It can get very busy so if you are driving anything bigger than a car choose your time carefully. The car park is small and the verge parking is (mostly) best suited to cars. Alternatively, be prepared for a long walk down the hill from a car park or up from the beach.",
          "My boyfriend and I were really excited to see the Fairy Pools, it was the sole reason we stopped in Skye on our road trip. A friend advised we went either very early or late afternoon and I understand why. Busses of tourists and impossible to park during the day. We arrived",

          "It is worth a visit when in the area. There is very limited parking space and a lot of people. Go early or late pm in the high season. Most people do only the first portion of the trail but it is a 8km loop that offers very nice views.",
          "I got there very early in the morning and there was just 1 other person there. There is a small car park on the right just past the walkway to the Fairy Pools. It is a fairly easy walk up and the climb is well worth it. The pools of water are incredibly beautiful. If you go to",
          "We visited 3 days ago, managed to park on the road and walked there easily. Our dog probably had the best day of his life, in and out the water, running free. The views were amazing, the Cuillins are majestic but the pools were dry. The water was warm due to hot weather and",

          "The walk up to the pools was stunning for the scenery and the pools and falls were probably at their lowest levels for years due to the warm sunny weather. You do not need to be super fit but it is worth wearing sturdy footwear and make sure you have water with you.",
          "We hit this place on one of the hottest days in Scotland. That was perfect. The pools were a bit low, but we dipped our feet and really enjoyed the cool pools and great views.",
          "However, be prepared for quite a lengthy trek, which can be physically demanding. There is a small forestry commission car park near the main access point on the Glen Brittle road but it regularly becomes overwhelmed. Many people just abandon their cars on the verges but this",
          "We visited on a hot sunny day and still managed to find a car parking space. The walk to the pool is a fairly short one and is definitely worth it once you're there. If you run out of water then you can fill up your water bottle from a spring as we did, the water was beautifully",
          "1. Get up early 2. Hydrate 3. wait an hour and use the toilet. Wait 15 minutes and use it again. 4. Drive to the fairy pools and pray for a parking space somewhere within a reasonable walking distance 5. This isn't an easy walk; put on reasonable shoes and walk, walk, and walk",
          "Okay! Every review and blog I read sang the praises of the Fairy Pools and the mystical qualities of the aquamarine waters, etc. NOT ONE mentioned some of the harsh realities of actually GETTING to these pools of delight!! THIS is the truth! If you ask almost anyone where or how",

          "Fairy Pools were definitely worth the walk. There is a small parking lot you can park in and then you walk downhill and back uphill to see the pools, not far though. They are absolutely beautiful and the walking really wasn't terrible. There is no place to use the restroom",
          "Great spot slightly spoilt by too many people. Stunning scenery with Black Cullins behind. Parking difficult at busy times but worth the short walk.",
          "This is a truly gorgeous spot but top tip - go earlier in the day to avoid the crowds. Our dog had a ball playing in the pools - a bit of a hike at times but well worth it.",

          "A really cool sight to see! The water is an amazing shade of blue. It\u2019s quite a walk (especially uphill on the way back) but the path is well maintained and easy. I can\u2019t imagine swimming in the ice cold water but it was windy and cool when we visited. Worth getting off the",

          "It was a nice sunny warm day..... So my boyfriend decided to take a swim in the \u201cpools\u201d To say it was cold was probably an understatement. There was a bit of a walk down/up to the pools and waterfalls. On a sunny day it\u2019s just about worth the walk and effort..... can\u2019t",

          "Well worth the drive along a single track road to take the 20 minute walk up to the pools. Even better to walk up further beyond the poolls. We took the opportunity for a short swim which was refreshing to say the least on a cloudy May day."

You have to cross a small river but it's not very bad. Parking is 5 pounds.",

          "Incredible beauty even if you only hike a short distance.  Depending on the weather there is one rock to rock stream crossing that could be tricky early on.  We visited on a rainy day, when the sun broke through the clouds the changing scenery of sun and cloud shadows on the nearby mountains was breathtaking.",
          "So worth the hike! It will take about 2 hours total for the visit with hike if you take a lot of pictures and see every level of the pools. A lot of it is shallow with a lot of river rocks so you can get very close to the waterfalls. \u2026",
          "Nice easy walk from the car park to the fairy pools, even on the cloudy day we visited, the scenery was still great though it was too cold to try and swim in the pools. Easy, fairly even path. Car park about \u00a35, cards accepted.",
          "Another great hike in Isle of Skye. One of the most beautiful spots at the Fairy Pools. There is paid parking. And it about a half hour walk up and then down. Be prepared for some small climbing. But the views are totally worth it. 40 \u2026",
          "This review might be slightly skewed given the weather during our visit was pretty grim. However, I felt the fairy Pools didn\u2019t live to the hype about them.\n\nThis is a good family walk with the first pools easily accessible within 30mins. I \u2026",
          "This is a trip for those that are good with hiking 3 -5 miles across the fields of Scotland.  We thought it's worth the time and is enjoyable and would do it again.  \n\nThe fairy pools are a stream that have created pools that some swim in \u2026",
          "This review is based on the fact that we didn't just go up to the spot marked in Google Maps. The fairy pools range from a bit before the spot to way behind it and offer many great views. I think it is not that special and would rate it 3 \u2026",
          "Lovely pretty place but can get busy. Path can be hard going with stepping stones which I found tricky to do.  No facilities. Large carpark. Take your rubbish home!",
          "Quite a scenic place located right next to the road to Glenbrittle. Fed by mountain water, the glen flows down a soft grassy hill, doing some cascades and providing some basins (take a swim If you dare\ud83d\ude00, water temp. Is ok (September), \u2026",
          "An amazing place to hike, swim, and take pictures. Waterfalls, streams, pools, all give you so much to experience. Good parking available for 5 pounds. No other real parking available.",
          "A short walk from some cheap parking, deep in a Skye valley. The hike isn't too difficult and the pools, while small, are far more impressive as you continue. Clean and comfortable. It's considered okay to swim here (but will be cold - bring warm dry clothes for after)",
          "Amazing place to wild swim. We took wetsuits and it was a wise decision! Dont be afraid to keep walking up to reach the higher pools, it was well worth it!",
          "You will have a long way walk down about five to ten minutes to the pools but worth the effort. Behind you will see a beautiful view with snowy mountains and forest. The water in the pools are crystal clear.\nYou can park next to the road if \u2026",
          "Wonderful attraction that is accessible to nearly every person who can walk 500 yards ( or metres near enough) the car park is a charity, \u00a35 to park is quite a lot (\u00a33 more like it!) and I noticed there was no discount if you arrived later \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning!  Our host at our guesthouse recommended a visit after dinner and she was spot on!  Apparently this place can be quite busy in the earlier parts of the day.  We arrived around 8:30pm and we probably saw 8 people the \u2026",
          "Awesome sight in Skye glad I decided to go well with the time. The water is clear, cold, and refreshing to drink via lifestraw. The archway pool is cool and had some people wild swimming it when we hiked.",
          "Fantastic walk from the car park. Such beautiful iconic Scottish scenery here. An absolute must-visit if you're on Skye!\nWe walked further on from the Fairy Pools to the foot of the mountains with it's broad shallow falls of it's own. No-one else around ... worth the extra stroll.",
          "What an incredible joke. The falls are nice but no different than the many beautiful falls found all over Scotland. These are just marketed well so they can put a fence up and take your money for parking. Hordes of people everywhere, \u2026",
          "It is kind of over hyped. There are far better waterfalls than this one. Plus you got to hike about 30 for the first one out of the seven pools. So take your time before you go.",
          "Beautiful nature location with a nice walk to the pools. Crossing the river via the stepping stones can be a challenge, but it's part of the experience ;-) car park charges \u00a35",
          "Breathtaking path and view. The way is sometimes a bit rough but with good shoes this shouldn't be a problem. The way goes along the river with several pools of cristal blue water and big and small waterfalls. Usually a busy spot but it \u2026",
          "You will encounter pools along the river after only a short walk, however, to see the more \"prime\" pools and falls, expect to walk at least 1 - 1.5 miles up the trail. Do note however that the pools are rather small and there are some \u2026",
          "A wonderful stop to see the magical fairy pools. Please not that you must have waterproof footwear to cross the streams. We saw a lot of people ruining their trainers! The legend is that immersing yourself will give you a long life. We just \u2026",
          "Before I went I read the reviews and now that I have been I find that they are accurate if you are a fit hiker. I expected to be up and down in a little over an hour but that was not accurate. If you want to take photos and are thinking of \u2026",
          "Its quite a walk from car park.. took us almost 40 minutes to reach to the spot.. its beautiful.. remember to carry water bottle and yeah no toilets nerby ..",
          "Absolutely amazing place with waterfalls, pools for swimming and to cool down on a warm summer day. The view is breathtaking.",
          "Went a little late in the day, about 5:30pm, so there were a lot fewer other people and did not have to pay for parking. Sun sets pretty late so it was plenty light and the sun did come out quite a bit. Lots of loose rocks on the trail but \u2026",
          "Looks amazing on postcards, but the pools are much smaller in reality. Besides that, there are some downsides. The only good way to reach the place is by car but the road is tight and in bad condition. Parking the car can be a real \u2026",
          "If you can avoid the photographers it\u2019s pretty great!",
          "One of the best place to visit in Skye. Do not miss this. The parking here is 5\u00a3 whole day. In summer the parking used to be full and we parked on main Street.. which saved \u00a35. You have to walk a bit.. in summer you will have enough water \u2026",
          "Nice walk. Very busy though.",
          "Such natural beauty x this place is magical, apart from the walk Haha x",
          "This is well worth the short walk. There are lots of pools with beautiful blue colour. Parking at the nearest parking area is \u00a35, cash only.",
          "Very crowded and not nearly as impressive as the reviews would suggest. Went fairly out of our way and spent a couple of hours here. It's undoubtedly a pretty place and the water is very clear but the feeling is pretty spoiled.",
          "Took quite a bit of a detour to get here, a lot of the journey was single track with passing places.\n\nThere is a car park (not free) and roughly a 25 minute walk to get to most of the pools. We went in April and it was extremely busy. There \u2026",
          "There are many pools in the river where you can put your feet in the water, build a dam, ...\n\nThe full walk is really long (4 to 5 hours). We have just walked for about an hour, and then retraced our steps. You walk parallel to the river, where you see the different pools and waterfalls.",
          "Beautiful walk which we hadn\u2019t anticipated would be as long as it was but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Absolutely spectacular views and clear blue water. Well worth the visit! The only thing I would suggest is bringing a drink and a snack for along the way!",
          "A bit muddy when wet, you Will need to cross a couple streams, but there are stepping stones in approx 1m increments. It is all up hill. It will take about 15-20 minutes to reach the first. Amazing place, definitely worth seeing if you are \u2026",
          "We were lucky to have a hot, sunny day there, the water was so clear and a lovely bluey/green colour.  We enjoyed the walk up and would definitely go back.",
          "Nice walk with lovely views, but way too crowded.  We went in the end of a rainy day and I still struggled to take photos without people in them.",
          "Fairy Pools are really beautiful. The trek to the pools is also very photogenic.  We went in the month of June and it was raining still we could see lots of tourists at the pool. The parking facility is not so good. Due to rains it had \u2026",
          "I lively place to go. Sadly there is alot of damage from people walking on the mud and grass. \n\nIt needs a path building all the way up and for people to respect the environment more.",
          "Wonderful place, especially in good weather. The drive is easy enough but involves some single track roads so pay attention. The car park is \u00a35 but it really is worth it to support the local area. The pools themselves are a trail of \u2026",
          "Beautiful and very easy walk, worth to stay for a wee while",
          "Stunning views make the hike worth it.",
          "Picturesque walk along the water, waterfalls and beautiful mountains in the background.  Great for most people (you will have to cross a river on stones to get to the bulk of it)",
          "No entrance fee, you need a car to get here, and it\u2019s empty in the morning! We arrived early and only saw three others on our journey who were out walking dogs! The waters were beautiful and crystal clear! Be on the lookout for the small \u2026",
          "Very nice and quite easy path from the parking area (5 pounds) to the Fairy pools. Path croases several small rivers so good shoes are important.",
          "Lovely. Tonnes of parking, though we went 2 weeks ago and it was still very busy so be aware.",
          "Fairy pools are beautiful on a nice dry day but feel like they are now a bit overrun with tourists. There are so many small rivers flowing through Scotland that are not as popular and much more impressive. \n\n\u00a35 for parking is also a bit expensive.",
          "A really beautiful place, highly recommended.\nIt is really crowded but you will always find a place to sit down and dip your foot in the water.",
          "Very nice and not too demanding nature walk along the stream with little waterfalls and all-shades-of-blue pools that can take a little bit more than one hour. Definitely try to go there if on Skye. Car park is closed by.",
          "Nice scenic landscape around the fairy pools and lots of beautiful views. Be sure to  walk as high up into the mountains as possible (at least 4 to 5 km) to get the best view and to leave most of the behind to have some quiet time up there.",
          "Bad place because people can fall and hurt there boady really bad beware that there verrry hard to find in skye",
          "This flair in fairy school and pools.\nVery very beautiful scottish landscape. \nWhere animals mingle with stream to animate singing as soon as birds. \nPh\u00ee\u013e the P\u00f5\u011b\u0165. &. \n\ud83d\ude1a\ud83d\udd1c\ud83d\udc8d\u2614\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\ud83c\udf82\ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc91\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude31\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udc6a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude181\u20e3",

          "Amazing place a must visit",
          "So beautiful and well worth the hike!",
          "The fairy pools were beautiful but the thing that made the entire trip so wonderful was meeting the hothouse Car Park Attendent Carol. She\u2019s so funny and utterly lovely. It\u2019s worth a visit just to meet this magnificent lady.",
          "Best enjoyed outside of peak times. Visiting after a walk in the Cuillins was perfect.",
          "Came here on the 20/3 , spring equinox,\nIt was amazing! The pools and the waterfalls were a great sight to see and the walk was quite pleasant...while the weather permits.\nStorm started and it began raining heavily plus the wind conditions, \u2026",
          "Very beautiful scenery\ud83d\ude0d",
          "This land is full of magic!",
          "Beautiful. The walk is not very long and not very difficult, although having to jump some rocks in order to cross some water areas. I would say the car park price could be a little cheaper though.",
          "Quite a hike but beautiful waterfalls and still water",
          "If you're visiting in the summer, bring a swimsuit and snacks (remember to take your trash with you when you leave) and have 5 pounds ready for parking payment. \nThis place is a must see and worth the effort of coming out there.",
          "Easy walk with amazing views",
          "It's completely not worth the hype .... Also, they are simply a small and accessible waterfalls. Its just a place for camping, for families. No need to go seperately there by investing your time and money.",
          "This was my favorite thing I did in Scotland!! If you're not going to swim though, don't go. You're just taking up space, ruining the beauty and wasting your time by not living your life to the fullest.",
          "Amazing trail! The pools closer to the entry are also very beautiful! Loads of little pools everywhere, it was a lovely experience.",
          "An amazing place that is free to visit, and well worth the time. Lots of little waterfalls and crystal clear pools (swimmable if you can brave the cold). Great walk, not difficult and offer some super photo opportunities.",
          "A wonderful tourist attraction on the Isle of Skye. Despite the rain and fog, it was a worthwhile visit to take in the beauty of the Scottish Highlands.",
          "Scenic area of Skye at foot of Cuillin Hills. 15 to 30 minute walk (depending how far up you  wish to walk and speed you walk at). Waterfalls and clear pools against backdrop of mountains: beautiful scenery.\n\u00a35 cash charge at entry to car park (to Outdoor Access Scotland Trust).",
          "Awesome place but to many visitors can take away the charm. Remember to take smidge. The forest car park is swarmed with midges",
          "\u00a35 parking without amenities. No toilets. No bridge to cross the river, with shoes submerged in the water. I suggest parking further down the road.",
          "Nice views lovely place\nOnly downside is 5 pound to park and no toilets",
          "Now first the stars are not a reflection of the the natural beauty of this place... Its stunning. Its more the fact of how they are handling the tourism. Thet have opened a car park which is great but now charging people. I get they need to \u2026",
          "Don\u2019t go there if it\u2019s raining outside. You will just walk for 1 hour to see something that you can see on every single moutain of the country, and you will have 5\u00a3 to park which is way too expensive to see a natural spot.",
          "Stunning location in the mountains. If you walk th full length it's about 2 miles plus the return walk. You have to cross a few streams so don't wear your best shoes or trainers on a wet day or after its been raining.",
          "Long time sence i had food that good it's that good am going back tomorrow",
          "Beautiful place to spend a few hours. Depending on how far up the stream you walk, you can spend from 40 minutes to over 2 hours in a lovely hike.",
          "Loved this hike in the Skye area. It was pouring when we did this but the trail was not slippery and the waterfalls were bountiful.",
          "Naturally beautiful but incredibly busy and access quite tricky. Would recommend avoiding peak times.",
          "Totally overflowed. The gras besides the path is muddy... The beauty and magic which this place had in past is gone. Too many people are ruining everything. Especially these ones who aren't really addicted to nature",
          "Amazing walk along the river. We even took a bath in one of the pools.",
          "Great short hike, beautiful scenery. Similar to some places in Idaho.",
          "Yet another stunning attraction on the Isle of Skye!\n\nAfter hearing so much about the Fairy Pools we thought we better check it out...and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Relatively easy to find with sat nav we parked in the car park paid our \u00a35 for \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, not too difficult a walk",
          "The water was beautiful however the surrounding landscape was depressing. Quite busy despite the cold and windy weather and the parking is \u00a35 (you will need cash as you pay an attendant). Unfortunately I feel this place is overrated, there are plenty of other places nearby which are prettier and not as busy.",
          "The place is a pilgrimage trail. Every single waterfall, every single pool had a person siting in it.\nGanges river in a miniature scale.\nOther than that, place is gorgeous.",
          "Cooling and cold. Recommend to come with warm clothes prepared. Also bring a towel in car to dry yourself after going up the fountain.",
          "Mega awesome definitely a trip to put on ya bucket list just remember \u00a33 cash only parking no cards",
          "Absolutely beautiful, but recommend during the week or off season if you're liking for some peace. Lots and lots of people. Worth the trip.",
          "Came here after 10 days on the stunning outer Hebrides. So crowded and overused here. Huge car park  with no other facilities. Falls were ok but not up to the hype. Dreadful road full of first time country road drivers. A nightmare.",
          "Beautiful place but can be quite busy. Best to go early in the day.",
          "A solid hike, and you definitely need ankle high boots to avoid getting wet and muddy. Totally worth going all the way to the top.",
          "A bit of a hike (20-30 minutes from the road), but well worth it. You jump a baby stream, be sure to bring good hiking shoes. \u00a35 for the car park, but it goes to a local trust. 10/10, gorgeous views.",
          "great scenic spot, be aware that the walk from the car park(after  a dodgy single track 20min drive)is around 2 km and not even or easy.\nabsolutely worth the effort if you can get it done.",
          "A great walk with some great views. in some places you can go down and get up close and personal with the fairy pools.",
          "Love this place. Recommend to wear a suitable shoes for the wet soils+stone path to prevent injury. :)",
          "Beautiful spot, but bring/wear Smidge to keep the midgies away",
          "Lovely place to visit once you get past the hoards.",
          "Nature is stunning but the place is overrun by tourists. And you have to pay 5.- for the parking. Also you have to mentally prepare yourself to fight against the annoying biting flies wich are really a pain in the back.",
          "If you are a tourist and want to arrive by car, walk alongside the  Fairy Pools with hundreds of other tourists and then get in your car again to drive off to the next tourist attraction... Then this place is just the right thing to for you \u2026",
          "The walk to the pools uses the same route there and back. The complete return distance to the first main waterfall and pool is 2.4km, with the average time to complete the walk being 40 minutes (with no stops). Most people will spend some \u2026",
          "Not a difficult walk.  Extremely beautiful.  Well worth taking the whole loop.",
          "Busy during tourist season, beautiful scenery",
          "Beautiful and refreshing, my boys and I had a swim in the pools. And at loved it. It was so cristal clear, cool and just lovely.",
          "Unbelievable blue/turquoise water reflecting off the blue stone below. Great experience!!",
          "Excellent if you like a midgy and getting wet. Unfortunately we had a disabled granny and a 1 year old in a buggy which was poor planning on our part, I'm assuming the midgy is the fairy, like a play on words...",
          "Take a dip in a pool. The depth ranges from 1m to 12m from various spots of the pools. Trek for a furlong to reach pools",
          "Beautiful spot but it is very busy and unfortunately the landscape is being spoiled by the amount of foot fall. There are more peaceful spots to view waterfalls.",
          "Great to see a new carpark there, much better. Definitely worth a visit now parking is so easy. The pools are as good as always and the improvements to the path have helped as well.",
          "Love this place. We kind of went off trail to get away from the crowds and it was brilliant.",
          "Very touristy in the beginning but as you get further up there are less and less people. Jump in and have a swim or take some great photos of the view or the waterfalls.",
          "A must do.  Extremely beautiful and it was rainy/cloudy when we went.  Can't imagine how it would have looked if it was sunny, however the cloudiness didn't  affect the beauty of the pools.  First pool is about a 20 minute hike from the \u2026",
          "Doesn't warrant the score it has on Google in my honest opinion. Having just climbed up one of the Munros, the pools were quite the anticlimax. Many other waterfalls available on Skye. FYI you have to pay \u00a35 to park (which is OK as it goes to some charitable stuff)",
          "Cool place to do a small hiking, even with family. Spectacular views",
          "15 minute walk from the car park (in general, parking spot is paid \u00a35 per car). Falls are along the walking track, which requires rather good trekking shoes. Suitable for dogs and children, altough sometimes there is need to jump over few rocks to proceed forward",
          "Over touricised, path a mudbath. Shame, these were nice before everyone started coming for Instagram selfies. I'm giving 5 stars to encourage more visits in the hope that, firstly, the car park fees will pay for much needed restoration. And secondly, the hope that other places don't suffer the same fate.",
          "Absolutely beautiful! 3 mile easy hike there and back. Tiny road leading up to it.",
          "Nice place where you have to pay for parking (why?) except the mosquitoes it was lovely place to visit :-)",
          "We came here on a sunny day at the end of November, it was a magical experience. The walk was steep and the path was not always well made so there is an element of slippage, if you go in the late afternoon the sun is on the opposite side to \u2026",
          "Nice walks in a fairy environment. Perfect view on the cuillins. Don\u2019t hesitate to spend 1h to walk the pools to the top. Opportunity to spend 15min drive to reach glenbrittle beach.",
          "Nice easy walk up to the pools, just be sure to wear waterproof shoes. There's a stream you need to cross at the bottom of the hill and the water can get a bit high after some rain. If you're wearing sneakers your foot can be completely soaked.",
          "Nice wee walk along waterfalls and stream. Amazing place to take photos. Parking cost 5pounds a day as local community are trying to rise some money and build toilets and shower over there. Highly recommended.",
          "Currently upgrading car park and facilities therefore 5 pound parking fee. No toilets on site.",
          "Stunning scenery, crystal clear water. A lovely walk. Ample parking.",

          "So beautiful, take care near the pools, saw one lady slip in and go under, rescued ok.",
          "So magical. We stayed for hours and took our time walking and enjoying the pools. The black hills made a dramatic backdrop. Definitely get there early as the car park fills up fast, and I\u2019d recommend going in the off season. We went in \u2026",
          "Great place to view the mountains too, lots of people but doesn't take away from the experience. Not suitable for prams or wheelchairs",
          "Beautiful, did a longer, circular walk as described on walking Highlands website that took just over 3 hrs in today. Depending on how much rain they have had will dictate the experience. My guide is if your feet get a little wet crossing the first stream the pools are full enough for fantastic photographs.",
          "Beautiful walk \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Must see in Isle of Skye! Worth the walk all the way up! Comfortable parking is available but you need to pay for parking.",
          "Great spot, family friendly (easy enough to access), but too much tourists. BRING YOU SWIMSUIT!!! You can swim in there if you ain't afraid of the cold. Water is 'freezing', as quotes by most people, but a Canadian it was only refreshing. \u2026",
          "Remember to take \u00a35 for the car park facility. They have done a great job upgrading the area and ensuring the beautiful scenery is there for all to enjoy for years to come.",
          "Not a place to visit this time of the year. Not really pools, I would just call them deep puddles of water. Its really not scenic so not worth spending 5 pounds for parking when there are no facilities also - no snacks, no toilets, just a \u2026",
          "A beautiful walk particularly in the off season when there are less people around. Make sure your shoes are waterproof, particularly if there's been a lot of rain recently as you have to cross two small rivers but it's worth it for the stunning views",
          "Pretty, and a short walk from the car.",
          "Absolutely beautiful and a walk we could even do with our two toddlers.",
          "A wonderful place to visit regardless of weather. My children had a fabulous time climbing over the rocks and spotting all the different colours through the water. Definitely worth a visit. A little bit of uphill and downhill trekking and a few creeks to go across but it's all part of the adventure \ud83d\ude01",
          "Amazing place with spectacular views. Only downside is the midges (swarming and biting insects). Just keep walking, they're slow.",
          "Lots of people. Interesting hike. There are many better hikes in Scotland.",

          "Definitely an amazing place. But there the \"super-tourisms\" begins. Like paying for the parking? Like meeting 1000 people in one spot even on rainy days? Like waiting to take a picture of one of the pools?\nUsually people say hi when they \u2026",
          "When you tell people you're going to Scotland they tell you to go to the Highlands. When you say you're going to the Highlands they tell you to go to the Isle of Skye. When you say you're going to the Isle of Skye they tell you to go to the \u2026",
          "Amazing, such an enjoyable walk. Sturdy boots a requirement. Bring a waterproof just in case. Be aware there is no public toilets, the car park fills up quite quickly and the full walk is 1.5-2 hours.",
          "Very pretty pools, nice walk, good parking at a moderate charge.",
          "What a wonderful and colorful experience, definitely recommend if you're visiting the Highlands of Scotland!!",
          "It's really lovely landscape, but it's basically just a small waterfall down a hill.",
          "Very crowded, but worth the hike. Rocky trail that twists along the pools. The backdrop is magnificent as well.",
          "Biggest disappointment.\n\nAny pond in the Alps looks better tbh. Not that they're specifically bad, they're ok, but the hype Vs what you get is just a joke.\n\nEither go really early before mass loads of pensioners and coaches arrive or just skip it and wander the coast. You'll get more out of that",
          "Nice pools all over the walk. 45 mn to go to the mountain.",
          "Really nice little pools with cold but refreshing water.. Unfortunately really busy and touristy.....",
          "Great for a day out, wonderful views. We went in the winter and it was stunning with the snowy mountains in the background but will definitely also want to come back in summer. There's 2 car parks a few minutes away from each other with the \u2026",
          "Came here in December during 40mph wind in the pouring rain. Experience was enjoyable but the weather probably meant that they weren't as crystal clear as described...\nWasn't blown away",
          "Magical journey through the mountain valley as the meandering fairy pools are a never ending journey of turquoise blue pools and falls... whatever the weather this is a must! Make sure you walk to the source of the stream.",
          "A difficult River to negotiate, especially after a period of rain and cost \u00a35 to park. Worth the short walk. Good footwear is essential.",
          "One of the best places to visit in Isle of Skye, with black cuillin ridge as background and many little stream. Not difficult to walk in good weather.best with waterproof shoes in case of the river lever goes up.",
          "A bit of walk needed. Wear sport or hiking shoes. Go take a dip at the pools if not too cold.",
          "What a beautiful place to visit. Worth visiting",
          "The fairy pools are a fantastic place to visit. Can be very busy and parking is somewhat at a premium but the walk to the pools and back isn't as far as it looks. \nViews are stunning and the pools themselves are amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone going a trip to Skye.",
          "Amazing place, must see!",
          "It is as good as the pictures. The pic i have does not even do justice",
          "Aqua blue waterfall on sunny day. Worth the 3 hours walk & hike from Sligachan Hotel. Breathtaking view of Cuillin range",
          "Lovely hike, nice weather is a must though.",
          "Not accecible to handycaped people",
          "Great hike to the Fairy Pools and back but make sure you have waterproof shoes or are willing to take them off as you have to cross a small stream on partially water immersed rocks.",
          "Nice walk, worth a visit. There is a 5gbp fee for the car park",
          "Most stunning hike on the Isle of Skye imho. The descent down to the valley makes you feel like the hero of some fantasy novel embarking on a quest. The first bit of pools are only about 20 min from the carpark. The water is actually \u2026",
          "Incredible natural feature of skye. It is a bit of a tourist hotspot, so try to go off-peak. Walkers can walk beyond the pools via nearby footpaths into and around the cuillin.",
          "Beautiful walk, even on a rainy day! Wear comfy and sturdy shoes!",
          "Captivating landscape! Perfect environment for hiking",
          "A long walk on a rocky path not suitable for wheelchairs. The pools are lovely. After a period of dry weather the falls will be weak.",
          "Amazing place, especially when it is sunny. I guess it depends on the period you come, but it can be hard to cross the river when there is too much water.",
          "A lovely spot to walk along some rolling waterfalls and pools but a severe lack of parking given the number of tourists. I would rate this as 5 stars if visited in the late evening or really early morning before the hordes arrive. My kids \u2026",
          "Lovely spot for a walk and sightseeing, as long as you bring sensible footwear and are happy to get a bit wet crossing the streams at the bottom (there are rocks to use as stepping stones but when we went the current was quite strong and \u2026",
          "Very nice place, sadly lots of tourists.",
          "Really nice place for a small hike. Absolutely clear water and sometimes a bit crowded.",
          "A brilliant magical place, and an absolute must on our recent trip to Skye, on a warmer day I would definitely taken a dip in one of the pools some are quite deep!  Don't forget your camera it's absolutely beautiful with the towering mountains above \ud83d\ude03",
          "Beautiful. A bit of a walk, but worth it. A few too many people on the weekend, and the carpark was quite expensive but all goes to keeping everything maintained I assume..",
          "This was a very cool hike. I didn't quite know what to expect as it wasn't something I had looked up in the guides.",
          "Yet again amazing .. wasnt busy like last visit . Water flow was a bit low , but pools were full",
          "Be prepared to pay cash for parking. That said it is beautiful!",
          "One of the best tourist attractions in sky. Although you need to walk a bit and climb a bit, but that is worth it. If we see only one place in isle of Skye, this will be that place.       One thing is worth mentioning, you need to cross a \u2026",
          "Well worth the walk to the enchanting water formations! Beautiful pools and puddles and waterfalls",
          "Pools are a short distance from the car park. Fairly easy walk. Five pounds parking for cars, three pounds for motorbikes",
          "Words cannot describe the beauty of the Fairy Pools!! Absolutely stunning, a must-see for anyone visiting Skye. Make sure you get there early to avoid the busy spells when coaches drop people off, and to get a good parking spot! Make sure you dress appropriately as the terrain us uneven underfoot and can be slippery when wet!",
          "Nice walk up, quite pretty, worth a visit.\nAnd watch out for the midges!",
          "Nice walk, water was pretty cold.",
          "I wish I wish I wish I had more time! U can easily spend the best part of a whole day here.  I suggest to come prepared! Where your swimmers and comfy shoes, and just go and chill when u get there.  Yes take photos but more importantly get in there! It\u2019s so refreshing!",
          "Great fun and a great hike...",
          "Fairy Pools is a very good walk and if you need a small dip in the fresh cold water from the hills, then here is your chance....I did it and is VERY cold \ud83d\ude03",
          "Beautiful clear cool pools and waterfalls to cool down in on a hot day (they do happen!). Plenty of spots to swim, paddle and explore. It's about a 10-20 walk to the start of the pools. There's good parking but it fills up quickly on busy days. However there is almost endless parking at the road side.",
          "Great sequence of falls. Very populair spot.",
          "HIGHLIGHT of our trip to Skye!!y husband and I found a more secluded pool and jumped in! Water was freezing but worth it! It was an easy walk, but a little ways from the car park. There are tons of amazing waterfalls once you get there! Highly recommend!!!",
          "The Fairy Pools are a great place to hike, although this area is perhaps a victim of its extreme popularity during the tourist season. We arrived early and were able to park in the small lot, but anyone there past around 9am had to park \u2026",
          "Didn't stop - manufactured tourist spot! \u00a35 parking and areas just as beautiful elsewhere on the island",
          "Beautiful, we went on a misty and drizzling day. Yet it was magical. We had a short swim in one of the pools between the waterfalls and the water was very cool, but completely OK to have a swim in. Unfortunately it was a bit of too cold day for my little girl to have a swim there too.",
          "Great place for a walk and swim highly recommend",
          "Amazing water pools. Definitely worth visiting!",
          "Many tourists, but for good reason. Beautiful setting, imprinted in memory forever.",
          "Beautiful pools, water clear as day, easy walk - definitely worth checking out!",
          "Fairly easy walk. Lovely area, well worth a visit.",
          "Awesome spot to visit. The upper carpark is free but quite a walk to reach the pools. The main carpark charges \u00a35 per vehicle so quite steep. The pools are about 20 mins walk from the main carpark. Great for swimming on a hot day. There are \u2026",
          "The food is good. Shame they are stopping the accommodation in their trekkers lodge and the bunk house, as this was affordable for walkers and divers. We probably won't be coming here again as the rooms are too expensive.",
          "Wonderful, but you have to pay 5 pounds to park.",
          "Beautiful place to go! The water is a mesmerizing colour, yet crystal clear. I am coming back here in September and I can't wait. Its a gorgeous walk I've been here 3 times so far and I always come back if I can!",
          "Awesome place. Really cool falls. There is one spot where you can swim and jump in from a decent height. Ignore the sign that says it's the end of the pools, keep going up and there are more falls.",
          "Imagination \nFairy \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2642\ufe0f can be under any pools\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",

          "Stunning place but quite a walk to get too.",
          "Car park across the road, easy walk. Not pram friendly though so take a baby carrier if you have young ones",
          "Nice views but that's it. We got there mid September so the water was quite high in the river and there was no footbridge at all. People were crossing over the very slippery rocks or had to cross barefoot. It looked very dangerous to me and surely not suitable for children. Footbridge would be really nice.",
          "Just magical. Well worth the walk. Be prepared for 4 seasons of weather every day",
          "Awesome walk. Nature at its best. We went during February, not to many tourists, and the weather was amazing, 16 degrees and sunny.",
          "My favourite walk in Isle of Skye. Also great for dogs. The full loop could take 4 hours or so. We went here both in sunny day and clear sky and on cloudy wet day, both are spectacular in different ways. The walk is fairly easy with no steep claim and well signed path.",
          "Was a shorter walk than expected to get to the pools from the car park but a very enjoyable one. Once there loved it the water is such an amazing colour. Make sure you take a towel because you'll want to jump in. Gets ridiculously busy.",
          "Beautiful walk beautiful views",
          "The fairy pools were an excellent short hike. Not only were the pools really neat, but the surrounding landscape was amazing and the sheep in the fields were a good source of entertainment for my wife. Very muddy in some areas, but this is \u2026",
          "Easy walk and You can take a dip too fun fun.. still need to be cautious \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",
          "We did a round trip from Sligachan. The fairy pools are nice, but too much hiped I think.",
          "Wow!! Beautifully breathtaking - and very easy to access, with parking (for a price).",
          "Really nice trip to walk among some fabulous scenery. Minor caveat is it's a tourist hotspot and there we're at least 1000 people there. Be prepared that the parking is tiny and all on the single track roadside so if you arrive later than \u2026",
          "The fairy pools are good. But they are small. Don\u2019t come here thinking you are going to be able to swim in them, I did and was disappointed. There are some great plunge pools to jump in tho. I wore as 4mm wetsuit and was plenty warm enough. \u2026",
          "Quite a hike, but we'll worth a visit.",
          "If you visit Skye is a must. My photos will speak for themselves.. Bare in mind is a lot of walking included and not suitable for wheelchairs at all. Also we were lucky for a beautiful sunny day. Enjoy...",
          "Beautiful pools but bring your dirty shoes it can be muddy",
          "This place is amazing, feel like I\u2019m in the scene in Lord of the rings. Would definitely worth visiting!",
          "Great hike! Looks like nothing when you approach it, then as you walk through, this crack in the earth turns into multiple waterfalls and pools. Each getting better as you through! Worth the visit.",
          "Too crowded. If you're expecting a picturesque hike by your lonesome, adjust your expectations.",
          "Ok we arrived there Late and it takes really a longer than to discover than we expected. You should plan at least 2 hours for the visit according to our experience.",
          "Amazing place you can feel your self real connect with the nature.",
          "Fantastic place with magic legends. Nice walk smooth with a few tricky passages. Bring your suit to have a great and cold swimming here in these blue natural pools",
          "\u00a35 cash to park, but no machine an no one to collect. Was a nice walk, can get busy. Muddy if it\u2019s rained recently so get right boots on. Also no facilities so take everything u need with.",
          "Simply amazing even though it was raining and wading was abit hard",
          "I would give it a 5 star if it weren't for the damn midges.  The hike from the car to the actual fairy pool is quite a ways...maybe 40 minutes.  The pools itself is actually a long series of pools and streams and falls.  Bring a rain coat \u2026",
          "Went here in November time so a bit chilly ,but well worth it..the pools are so lovely, its is a bit of a walk so wear comfy shoes and wrap up in the winter time..the views are great and the colours are beautiful..car park is small ..but the lady who wrks there is helpful and friendly..they also have porto loos..",
          "A little bit over rated. But go ahead to Coire na Creiche and make a round trip, it\u2019s far better.",
          "Indescribably beautiful. It will take your breath away. This is a must for anyone's bucket list.",
          "Bit of a hike ever upwards, but rewarding you with beautiful impressions.",
          "A special, serene place in Scotland where I can actually imagine faeiries sitting around a toadstool and dancing by the blue pools of water at night!",
          "Wonderful!!! There is a steep walk down at first, but it is worth continuing the walk to the pools. The water is transparent, there are many small viewing points with waterfalls and circular pools. Definitely worth driving all the way here \u2026",
          "I enjoyed the walk around the fairy pools. Weather was decent and got some great photos.",
          "The perfect experience. A great walk over to the pools with an amazing view of the Black Cullins the whole way. It's an easy walk, 30-45 minutes to the start of the pools and then you can go up as far as you like. The pools themselves are incredible and very inviting if you want to take a swim.",
          "A bit attractive but there are only small waterfalls",
          "Easy hike for spectacular views! Highlight of the Highland!",
          "We had a great time, will definitely be going back",
          "Just beautiful! Don\u2019t miss this.  Great walk and if you are brave, lovely place for a quick dip! We went at 8pm on a Friday night and had no issues with parking or overcrowding.",
          "Nice views and nice walk but dont live up to the hype. If you are out that way any way they are worth a stop.",
          "Stunning place,  although very busy and \u00a35 for carpark a bit steep...",
          "Magical, worth the walk all the way.",
          "Amazing place, bit of a walk from carpark though and normally quite busy so make sure you are prepared before visiting",
          "Nice views, make sure u have proper walking footwear. When we went there were a few streams that needed some waterproof boots tbh.\n\nWould have given 4 stars but the car park charge of \u00a35 seemed excessive as the car park is not well \u2026",
          "A beautiful walk but it can get very busy.",
          "beautiful place, easy but a slightly long hike for kids.",
          "Please go. Once in a life time experience. Fairyes are real!!",
          "Really nice was along the creek up to the base of the mountains with spectacular views. The walk has a well worn path and is not at all difficult if you take your time. We were here in winter and the mountains were covered in snow and the creek partly frozen which made for some interesting ice formations. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely but crowded",
          "Way overrated....and its pathetic that the tourist industry can ask you \u00a35 for parking in the car park (no receipt) and do not even provide one single toilet or ablution block for the 1000\u2019s of visitors...\n\nThis apply to other main sites as well like Lealt falls, the Storr etc",
          "Honestly was a little disappointed after seeing photos. Worth it if you\u2019re driving by but don\u2019t go out of your way to see them.",
          "Place doesn't seem real, it is an Awesome place... Magical.... We hiked past the pools to the mountains and saw a sea eagle.... Outstanding!",
          "The area in general is gorgeous and the falls and pools are very whimsical. The walk to them is an easy 20-40 minute hike depending on how far along the pools you walk (there is a sign at the end letting you know when the official pools \u2026",
          "Crowded place but very beautiful!",
          "Absolutely stunning. I went during winter time and the water was partially frozen which only made it more magical.",
          "Love it love it just love it. So mystic.",
          "Fantastic place to visit on the Isle of Skye. A bit of a hike to get there but well worth it!",
          "Beautiful, one of many 'must go' places at Isle of Skye",
          "Very beautiful",
          "Well I think this is a Scottish fairy story because we couldn't find it went round and round following Google maps for a hour",
          "Really nice trip to walk among some epic scenery. Bare in mind the parking place is tiny so if you arrive later than 9am you will be forced to park on the side of the road. Another thing is that the way to is through a one car,  narrow road so be mindful while driving.",
          "It's just soo moist",
          "We absolutely loved the hike and got beautiful photos. It's way way too cold to swim here. I wouldn't do it without wetsuit and wetsuit booties at a minimum. It's a fairly crowded spot so if you're looking to have the place to yourself there are many other places to hike.",
          "A beautiful place. Quite a long walk over uneven ground to reach this lovely spot. The walk is well worth it.",
          "Absolutely amazing experience!  The down to the pools is totally worth the time.",
          "Beautiful and great fun to have a dip",
          "Most beautiful place I've every been. Be prepared to spend all day here!",
          "Nice but very busy.",
          "Parked on the road because it was so popular the official car park was overloaded. About a 5 minute walk downhill to the first waterfall area, then about another 45 minutes worth of walking along to the far pools. Absolutely beautiful and \u2026",
          "Amazing sights with an easy walk",
          "Brilliant hike for some of the most breathtaking views in my life. Absolutely worth it, a once in a lifetime experience specially in good weather conditions!",
          "A must-do hike in Isle of Sky! Bring your bathing suite if you want to jump into chilly spring fed pools!",
          "Worth it! Quite Beautiful. However, it can be hard to get there if you don\u2019t have a car yourself. I took the Taxi, quite expensive!!!",
          "Great place to visit if you love nature. I advise you to set off early (7-8 am) to avoid problems with parking. This place gets very busy as any other places on Skye really.",
          "Lovely walk and great views",
          "Easy tracks. Many people and dogs.",
          "Beautiful pools and waterfalls. Takes an hour to reach the top without stopping at every pool.",
          "It was all fun and games until Karen took the kids.",
          "Fantastic location to visit on the Isle of Skye, easy hike from the car park.",
          "Easy walk with stunning views. The Fairy Pools are truly magical, but somewhat ruined by all the people.  Pick a slow day to go so you can be less disturbed and have an easier time parking.",
          "Beautiful place!\nTake your precautions with the midges! It\u2019s full of them!\nAlso, make sure to wear appropriate shoes for a hike.\n\nThe place is amazingly beautiful!",
          "The fairy pools, what can I say? Beautiful in that slap- you -in -the- face with driving rain  and howling wind Scottish way! Having arrived at 9am and got the last space in  the car park (you must get there early) we hiked to the pools in \u2026",
          "Awesome place,views. There are a few parking,but annoying road.",
          "Nothing really fairy about it. But a good walk.",
          "I love this place.. still loving... Awesome place to visit.. each and everyone in this world must visit once in their lifetime \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Too crowded, fee for parking. There are better places.",
          "It was raining while we hiked up there, but it was amazing still. We didn't get to see the pretty colors because of the clouds and rain, but the waterfalls were still amazing and the hike was enjoyable.",
          "Very beautiful place. Best time to visit is after rainy season. We went during summer and the waterfalls were dry. The scenic beauty is un-matched.",
          "Awesome scenery, nice walk",
          "Was chucking it down on the day i went. After crossing the overflowing stream to continue walk was severely unimpressed by what amounts to a few small waterfalls. I'm sure it's better when it's not raining but fat chance of that in \u2026",
          "Beautiful area with cold clear waterfalls. Take sturdy shoes and if you are a little frail a good stick. Well worth the effort",
          "A lovely place to visit while on Skye! The path is not hard to cross, although it is adviseable that you are wearing waterproof shoes, as you will have to cross afew streams . There is a parking structure at the begining of the path that costs 5 pounds for the whole day.",
          "Amazing water. Bring your dookers!",
          "Great walk by the river and pools. Huge numbers of tourists until about half way up. Nice circular walk from the very top",
          "Rather soggy day but still got out there! The scenery is rather nice but the pools in itself is nothing all that spectacular really. Trail is full of tourists as expected. Wear good footwear guys and girls!",
          "This is absolutely fabulous place to trek on the Isle of Skye! Fantastic waterfalls and enjoyed the walking in.. The pictures is not showing that the Amazing view! \nWe went in January, cold weather but absolutely wonderful.\nBe careful when you walks.",
          "Totally stunning! Worth the visit cars are \u00a35 campervan a little more",
          "Nice small waterfalls with a pretty and easy hike in a valley surrounded by mountains. Figure 25 minute walk each way if you're in average shape. Unfortunately also surrounded by tourists since this is a popular spot. Still worthy of a \u2026",
          "About 30-45 minutes trek to get there,  but worth the walk if going in the summer,  take a swimming costume.  It gets quite busy, so going later in the day is better.",
          "So beautiful and worth the trip!!! Bring waterproof hiking boots though! Sneakers do not do well on the mud and wet rocks.",
          "Good shoes and good balance should accompany your spirit of adventure.   You'll see every color in the water rocks hills and sky.  Plan on 2 hours.   As always bring your slicker.",
          "Awe-inspiring place to visit.  The walk through the glen is beautiful & taking a plunge under one of the waterfalls is an experience not to be missed.",
          "Lovely place but very busy. We were there fairly early in the morning and parking was a problem at that time already. It's a shorter walk than it looks and is well worth it, we were there on an overcast day and thought the colours would be magical on a sunny one.",
          "An hour walk from the car park, and your are in the mighty fairy nature heaven. It's even better off-season, as there are less people.",
          "Not what we expected from all the reviews on the Internet. Just another waterfall, but with too many visitors. The path was muddy due to the many visitors. The road was full of parked cars (though they are extending the parking area). We \u2026",
          "Beautiful, naturally occurring water pools coming down from the Cuillin Mountains. Good paths follow the pools upstream into the base of the mountain range.",
          "Great place for a scenic walk along a series of waterfalls and pools. The walk isn't too difficult although I would recommend wearing sensible walking shoes. Would definitely recommend a visit here is you are on Skye.",
          "Soooooo beautiful... words cannot describe it!!!!",
          "If you want to see nice waterfalls etc... then there are better places to go if that's what you're after.\nThe walk to the pools is a short stroll but I would recommend the loop that takes you beyond, up and around the pool area and thar is \u2026",
          "Lovely place to visit on a hot sunny day. The waterfalls are not that impressive, but they are unique for Scotland. In under 2 hours you can walk to the end, have a dip in the cold water and walk back. The parking lot can get crowded but there is lots of space on the little road.",
          "Wonderful afternoon exploring the fairy pools.  Great photos of you are daring enogj to get into position to   clamber into position to get them.  If not just enjoy a great walk with spectacular scenery",
          "\u00a35 to park, miles to walk, then try to get over a wide stream/ river, hills to climb, mucky swamps to go through & it wasn't worth it. Waterfalls with slightly green water at the bottom. Disappointing.",
          "Very beautiful, but too much tourists",
          "Great walk could be tricky at the start but suitable for everyone.  But it is muddy, everyone needs suitable shoes for this one as you do have to cross a stream/river to get to the pools, alot of people wearing unsuitable footwear slipped \u2026",
          "Perfect stop off for a dip in the pools and shower under the fall's be careful as some of the faeries are mischevious and will disappear with your clothes off the side of the bank, quite an awkward walk back to the car, apart from that embarrassing moment I highly recommend getting off the beaten track and go for a dip",
          "Well worth the coronary lol. Its a long walk...id say coming back up the hill is tough (but obviously not if your fit). Despite that id recommend it to anyone. Its stunningly beautiful and worth every step. Nature at its best!",
          "Lovely walk on a well maintained path, happy to pay parking as locals are expanding car park and doing other improvements.",
          "Awesome place to visit in the heart of Skype. There is a great trek either down the way or goating it across the rocks in the river bed up to the actual pools. There are quite a few places where you can actually take a dip in crystal-clear waters. Arrive early as it gets crowded and hard to find a parking spot.",
          "Great place to visit.",
          "Stunning waterfalls. A bit of a walk so allow plenty of time. Its very popular too so plan to get there early.",
          "Love the view and the pools. Many tourists in summer, bathing/dipping feet in the pools. It's very refreshing, recommended to go into the pool before hiking back downhill.",
          "Lush chain of water fall in a dramatic location, you can easily spend good few hours here, make sure to be in your comfy shoes and pack a few extra clothes because you won't be able to resist taking a dip in these pools, there is a washroom \u2026",
          "First freshwater steam I've ever visited that you're apparently able to drink from(as per a local but I didn't attempt). Amazing little place to reinvigorate the spirit.",
          "Amazing place and views. \nGet there early to avoid the crowds of tourists.\nThey have now made the car park pay and display! \u00a35.00 to park a car! Will probably just push more people to park on the already crowded verges at side of the road.",
          "They\u2019re cool, I guess. You get a nice little hike and a chance to take in some picturesque waterfalls. But you have to deal with a very tiny car park, where people seem content to park crooked or perpendicular to other cars. You may end up being that guy who parks on the shoulder of the road. And that\u2019s not cool for you, or anyone else.",
          "What is not to love about the magick of the Fairy Pools?  I was there in May 2016 and was gently pushed in the pools by the wee fairy's hiding from me... I returned in October 2017 and the beauty is just as amazing and breathtaking.  I \u2026",
          "Beautiful blue pools with the majestic Bruach na Fr\u00ecthe in the background. \n\nHiking boots recommended but not absolutely necessary. The path isn't difficult to ascend but take note as there are several large streams to be crossed via standing stones (pictured).\n\nWell worth the trip any time of year.",
          "It's magical to walk there, nature is stunning there",
          "OMG, this is so overrated! They know it, and they also know they got you.\nThis is a running creek with hundreds of people, and drones there, you can't even take a picture without zooming in, with a steep 5 pound parking. You can't hear the water anyway, -- people are flying drones there????  sight seeing experience in Scotland.",
          "Mystical even though there were a lot of people. It's absolutely worth to do the round walk. It's about three hours walk.",
          "Amazing location, gorgeous views, would highly recommend",
          "Beautiful blue waters and surrounding mountains. Usually a little crowded during the middle of the day.",
          "Nice place to visit\nImpressive pools\nHaving been several times we now find it far too busy when lots of tourists and the parking can be problematic...",
          "Really incredible experience overall - the drive out to it, the rugged scenery, and the hike up to the pools. All are sublime and worth the somewhat arduous trip, especially now that you have to deal with some crazy crowds and traffic on \u2026",
          "Free! Stunning natural beauty. A fair walk from the car. Plenty of parking. Small burns to step over and large rocks to hop onto crossing a stream make this inaccessible to the less mobile. Prepare for rain as always on Skye.",
          "Just spectacular .. amazing view and a very peaceful place to be at going outside the city",
          "The scenery is breathtaking! The Glen Brittle (valley) that the Fairy pools sit in is worth the trip itself. The hike to the pools is easy, easier than the drive. This is a must see, if you're in the area.",
          "Great place. Worth a visit.",
          "Nice falls and pools. Easy hike from the road or car park if you\u2019re lucky to get a spot here. Spots for swimming along the way.",
          "Lovely part of the world, had a great and refreshing swim here. Beautiful pool and clear water. Bit cold though!",
          "The hike from Sligachan to the Fairy pools is just amazing",
          "A beautiful mystical part of the Isle of Skye on the edge of the Cullin mountain range. Well worth a visit on the sun and pouring rain. Sturdy shores or boots recommended, and get there early as the area only a few parking spots available.",
          "Was really pretty and would be great for kid to explore. Pack a lunch and some swimmers if it's a nice day. The parking is not ideal so allow extra time!",
          "The Fairy Pools are a beautiful walk particularly in the morning. This site is attracting an increasing number of tourists so it can get very crowded. We visit Ed around 10 am and it was crawling with tourists, perhaps an earlier or later \u2026",
          "A fair breezy walk during \u201csummer\u201d in Scotland. Beautiful and I believe it suits for all ages.",
          "Great walk. Always stunning to be around running water and falls",
          "Spectacular views and crystal clear water to swim in. Parking however is a nightmare and usually has far too many people trying to cram cars and camper vans into tiny spaces, with little thought for other road users. Also be aware it's \u2026",
          "The place is full of tourists, and nice but nothing spectacular.  If you're adventurous then Scotland has plenty more to offer.  Tour groups use this as a few hour trip.  I suppose it's decent for that because it has a fairly large parking \u2026",
          "Worth exploring further up the trail than most do. Most people will take the loop, but if you go up a bit higher, it'll be lovely.",
          "Beautiful place to hike",
          "I really recommend to visit the Fairy Pools. Its very beautiful and we walked to the end sign in 40 min. We also stopt a lot to take pictures. Its an easy walk.",
          "Parking here is the biggest issue. Worth the walk up to see them. They really are beautiful. However, not recommended for disabled access or prays. A little warning - even though they look inviting don\u2019t just jump in, even on a warm day, \u2026",
          "Nice easy walk",
          "Absolutely amazing,  would recommend it to anyone, beautiful beautiful beautiful",
          "Such a beautiful place. I hope to go back!",
          "Car park is tiny, so side of road parallel hill parking is required. No toilet facilities, but it seems as the whole bush just over the barbed wire fence is a toilet. The pools are beautiful, the water clear. The paths are very muddy after a very wet summer, so prepare with good shoes. Wild camping spots are around.",
          "Ok place. I mean i love waterfalls, i don't like people in waterfalls. It was busy, i understand this is a good place to cool off, personally i would go to a beach and not sit on a top of a pool, where other people sit down the stream. \nAnyway, was a bit disappointed.",
          "Beautiful hike/ walk and amazing for photography. They are fun to climb around in and get some pictures from different angles.",
          "A beautiful magical place even in the pouring rain. The path up is quite rugged and the stepping stones halfway up were a bit of a challenge for the dogs. What a shame that the verges were churned up into a muddy mess by ignorant people ignoring the no parking signs.",
          "Crowded or it would be 5 stars.",
          "Well worth the walk. The surrounding scenery is absolutely gorgeous. I was very tempted to dip my toe in the water. Maybe next time.",
          "While the fairy pools are better when there are fewer folk around, there is an undeniably magical charm to the place whether you're passing people or not. From the immense views of the walk as you drive down, to watching the clouds swirl \u2026",
          "Don't go here until the new car park and road has been fixed. It is far to busy, people all park on the side of road so not enough space. My car nearly fell off the mountain and I had to wait 4 hours to be rescued. Shame because it is amazing g place.",
          "Clearest waters I've ever seen, really nice long walk along the pools and great views of the mountains in the back ground. People can swim in the pool if that's your thing and it can be quite muddy so be prepared.",
          "A lovely place with a good footpath although challenging in places. As long as you are willing to dodge plenty of midges and other people trying to take pictures you can get some decent pictures too.",
          "Really nice and easily accessible. Victim of its own popularity as it's very busy. Parking is a lottery - I was in a large motorhome ... Nightmare!!\nIf you could only have this place to yourself for an hour it would betruelly magical.",
          "We went when there weren't many tourists and it was just lovely. Even took a wee dip!",
          "Bring shoes you don\u2019t mind getting muddy, and don\u2019t be scared to cross the river on the rocks. Not as slippery as it seems",
          "Amazing views and beautiful landscape if you can get there on a sunny day. Parking can be scarce during peak periods so you may need to park along though road making it more difficult to get in & out on the single track road.",
          "Beautiful scenery, crystal clear water and lovely falls and pools.  Why you want to visit Skye or anywhere else in the height of Summer is beyond me!  No point complaining about parking and bad paths when everyone flocks to see the main attractions.  November to mid-March is the only time to experience Skye.",
          "This is an absolutely fabulous place for a day trek. Really beautiful waterfalls and natural pools. The hike is suitable for all levels of walkers. Pretty good place to take children too but obviously should keep an eye on them at all times.",
          "Just need to get back there and actually dive into the pools!",
          "Excellent day out, need a good hour to walk and take photos.",
          "I went in automn and the weather wasnt its best. But i thought it was a little over hyped. Still pretty and worth a look if you have the time",

          "Absolute waste of time and money.",
          "A must visit if you're up at skye.",

          "Gorgeous scenery, short walk from carpark for families with spectacular surroundings. A bit far out of the way though, but if you've got time and fuel definitely would recommend visiting.",
          "beautiful.  very busy.  lucky to find a spot on the side of the road to park. walked up to the very last pool a little ways past the sign of the end of the trail. there we were able to enjoy a pool all to ourselves. difficult to get a good \u2026",

          "Its a nice location for a view point, a small hike for about 20-40min, although the waterfall / pool is not very big or stunning.\nBut if weather is good, the view is nice.",
          "It's a tough walk if it's as windy as it was the day we visited, but well worth it. Crystal-clear pools of water straight off the mountain tops, and waterfalls all the way down.",
          "Beautiful landscape and enjoyable walk",
          "Magical place. If you visit it in the summer, on a sunny day, go swimming. Crystal clear water.",
          "If you go all the way from the parking to the waterfall and pools at the end, and back, it's about a 3-km walk. Mostly easy, although there are a few spots where you have step/jump over running creeks and show a bit of agility. Also, while \u2026",

          "Best wild swim to date",
          "Full on tourists! Even when it's raining. Had a lovely time anyway but it wasn't what I was expecting. We found lots of other places that were just as nice and we had them all to ourselves.",
          "Very dissapointing. The pools were nice to look at. However due to their popularity the footpaths are very badly eroded, almost 4 metre wide paths of mud caused by too many visitors combined with wet summer. It seems there are plans to \u2026",

        "wiki": "Dunvegan Castle is located 1 mile (1.6 km) to the north of Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland. It is the seat of the MacLeod of MacLeod, chief of the Clan MacLeod. Probably a fortified site from the earliest times, the castle was first built in the 13th century and developed piecemeal over the centuries. In the 19th century the whole castle was remodelled in a mock-medieval style. The castle is built on an elevated rock overlooking an inlet on the eastern shore of Loch Dunvegan, a sea loch.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site is likely to have been a Norse dun (fort), though no traces of any prehistoric structure now remain. The promontory was enclosed by a curtain wall in the 13th century, and a four-storey tower house was built in the late 14th century. This tower was similar in style to contemporary structures at Kisimul Castle and Caisteal Maol. Alasdair Crotach, the 8th chief, added the Fairy Tower as a separate building around 1500. During the 17th century, new ranges of buildings were put up between the old tower and the Fairy Tower, beginning in 1623 with the state apartment built by Ruaraidh Mor. The old tower was subsequently abandoned until the late 18th century, when the 23rd chief began the process of homogenising the appearance of the castle. This process continued under the 24th and 25th chiefs, with the addition of mock battlements and the new approach over a drawbridge from the east. The present appearance of the castle dates from around 1840 when this process of \"baronialisation\" was completed. The castle is a Category A listed building.\n\n\n== Site ==\nDunvegan Castle occupies the summit of a rock some 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, which projects on to the eastern shore of a north-facing inlet or bay. On the eastern, landward side of the site is a partly natural ditch around 18 feet (5.5 m) deep.\n\n\n== Artifacts ==\nNotable family heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle include:\n\nDunvegan Cup\nFairy Flag\nSir Rory Mor's Horn\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDunvegan Castle's homepage\nDunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye, Clan Macleod Scotland\ngrid reference NG245490",

          "We recently toured this attraction and loved it. We had a beautiful sunny day to tour the gardens and castle. The castle is beautifully decorated and so full of history and artifacts. Definitely worth a stop if your in the area.",
          "Dunvegan Castle is one the greatest Hebridean castles and the only Highland fortress to have been continuously occupied by the same family for 800 years. It is a self-guided tour; however, attendants in each room are friendly and answer your questions with insider knowledge.",

          "The castle was a self tour , with guides in each station/room to share information . Very nicely done, lots of information, and one of our favourite castles. The gardens were amazing! We wandered around for over an hour, and could have spent the whole morning there. A nice break",
          "We enjoyed this far more than expected. The gardens are pretty and interesting without being overly formal and varied areas considering the more compact site than other castles we have visited. The castle itself was interesting to view with a lot of items to look at and again",
          "Lets start with the Castle is magnificent and the works of art just beautiful. The most enchanting thing were the gardens and give yourself some time to really enjoy. Can't skimp on time with this visit.",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed the tour of the castle that Is impeccably maintained with detailed history. The gardens are beautifully designed and well maintained and instils a sense of peace in natural surroundings.",
          "The castle and gardens are wonderful, I am a decendent from the clan and enjoyed seeing some of my family history.",
          "The Castle is in a beautiful position and very imposing, and although there were not many rooms to see inside it was all very interesting. The highlights though were the gardens very impressive especially the water garden. There had been a lot of rain up in Scotland so the",
          "We visited recently, when the weather forecast was pretty poor! We had a stroll around the gardens before the rain arrived - they are beautiful. The gardeners were happy to answer our questions, and were very friendly. There is a wonderful collection of plants here - well worth",
          "We were touring the Isle of Skye during a period of poor weather, and came across a sign advertising the castle. With little else to do, we thought it would make a nice diversion, so initially dropped in to their cafe located in the car park (accessible without paying to go into",
          "This castle and gardens can be done in about an hour. The castle itself was nice and we enjoyed seeing the artifacts. It also had a fun surprise near the end. The gardens were amazing and not to be missed. The water garden was my favorite and my husband enjoyed the walled",

          "A very interesting tour around the Castle learning the history of the Macleods and the structure of the castle to what it is today. Gardens are well-maintained and beautiful to look at.",
          "We visited Dunvegan Castle during a holiday on Skye. Pretty drive to the castle. It stands in a commanding position overlooking the loch. It is a lived in castle of the CLan MacCleod. Interesting exhibits, nice shop,beautiful gardens with a lovely walled garden and exciting",

          "A must visit if you go to Skye. A wonderful Scottish castle in a beautiful setting. Make sure you allow a couple of hours to wander around the peaceful setting of the castle gardens. Good value for money.",
          "Even if you are not named Mc.Leod, this is a property worth a visit. The castle itself has been built in stages, the oldest dating back to the 12th century. Much of the castle is not open to tour, but what is gives insight to the lives of the many generations of Mc.Leods that",
          "Called in when passing as we had the Gardeners World 2 for 1 voucher. Lovely gardens eith great views over the bay & included in the price was a tour of the castle. Definitely worth a visit but great value with the half price voucher",
          "After 10 days in Scotland, I got a castle overdose! I remember the grounds but not the inside, furniture and heirlooms, modest by any standards. At the end, they all look the same! The MacLeod Estate was interesting because it is still occupied as a residence. The gardens are",
          "This beautiful estate has fantastic preservation on the inside, with handouts in most rooms detailing what you are seeing. Stroll outside into the gardens for a leisurely walk and then down to the waters edge to see the seals basking in the sun.",
          "This was not our favorite but still interesting . The furniture was distracting and the whole feel was just not right. The gardens were nice and walking around to the beach was a good walk. The backside of the castle from the water is the best view. There are better castles.",
          "The castle was all we expected. The rooms were each full of their own character and history. They were full of so many amazing things, we didnt know where to start. Many of the rooms told a story which brought the history of the castle alive, from the dungeon to the servants",
          "If you're visiting Isle of Skye, be sure not to miss this castle. Surrounded by beautiful gardens which lead to the loch where one can pay extra for a boat trip which takes you near the seals.",
          "This castle is a must visit for anybody interested in Scottish history and in particular in the history of the McLeods. Car parking is free! The entrance fee of GBP14,- for castle and gardens is on the high side. But what you will get is a castle in a very good condition",
          "The 'castle' is really more of a baronial estate with nice views and wonderful, quite large garden(s). There are several walled gardens. The main one has a couple of waterfalls that were roaring due to rains morning. The car park is big, but can fill up during tourist season.",
          "It's quite a small castle and not particularly impressive. But you shouldn't listen to me - I don't really like castles.",
          "We visited in our motorhome, car parking was fine, although we arrived early and it did get very busy later on. We only visited the gardens as we had our dog with us. They are beautiful and so well laid out. We spent a couple of hours exploring and going down to the pier. It",
          "Have visited quite a number of castles all over the UK, this is quite a small castle, but I assume it is because of it\u2019s location. It is a great castle with amazing artefacts and paintings of previous clan chiefs. It is worth sitting down in a dedicated room, where they have a",
          "I would recommend coming here, and enjoy the castle and gardens. The history is also interesting. I would try to pick a non-rainy day as the grounds are very nice.",
          "It is definitely worth visiting Dunvegan Castle and gardens if you are out on Skye. Make sure to check castle tour times before arriving at the castle so that you catch one! The garden was lovely in June and full of colour. We were fortunate to visit during a dry spell so we",

          "Dunvegan is the home to the MacLeod clan--oldest continuously lived in castle in Scotland. Hugh Magnus MacLeod is the current and 40th Chief of the Clan. We really enjoyed the gardens with plants originally obtained by 'plant hunters' from around the world. We saw a Monkey",
          "We visited the castle during a rainy day, but even so the gardens are just incredible! they seem a magical place from fairy tales. There are all sorts of little hidden places that you can see around the gardens and it was extremely enjoyable to stroll through them. The view of",
          "Nice and interesting better than Edinburgh Castle and not so extended as Stirling Castle. Enjoy the gardens and sorrounding. Also take advantage to visit sorrounding such as Choral Beach which is few miles away.",
          "We came with our dog so could only access the gardens (castle is dog free). We weren\u2019t convinced the entrance fee for just the gardens would be worth it but we were wrong, it was. This is a lovely place to visit. The weather was torrential and windy and the gardens were a nice",
          "Not an inexpensive day out. Particularly if paired with seal boat ticket. Good parking. As others have mentioned castle exhibits quite dull unless A4 card read in each room. Enjoyed the gardens and plenty of them. Seal trip was very much enjoyed.",
          "Visited here with the kids (4 & 7) on a recent trip to Skye. The gardens are fantastic with loads of different paths and areas to look at. The kids had a great time exploring. The castle itself is really interesting and the staff were knowledgeable and happy to answer any",
          "I know the house can't be made more accessible but paths and roads require to be better maintained as pot holes and ground poor.",
          "We came to see the castle and while it wasn\u2019t yet raining we started with the gardens that were magnificent. After that we went to visit the castle. I loved seeing about Flora MacDonald because the day before after the Skye museum there is a small cemetery where she is buried.",
          "We planned to go to Dunvegan largely because of the opportunity to go seal watching. We hadn't appreciated just how far away Dunvegan was - it took us nearly 2 hours to get there after crossing onto Skye, but it was well worth the trip. The castle itself is okay, but not",
          "We really enjoyed Dunvegan - more in comparison to Edinburgh and Eilean Donnan. Beautiful gardens, very interesting history about the Macleods. Highly recommend!",
          "Very nice gardens and castle. See the video in the castle and leave plenty of time for extensive gardens.",
          "Enjoyable visit to the Castle, well run gift shop and cafe, staff helpful, beautiful gardens that are dog friendly.",
          "The way the cafe is set up creates long queues because visitors have to order coffee/teas first then wait behind people wanting hot dishes when some people may just want coffee and cake or something light. The drinks area should be at the end near the check out , cakes and",
          "I loved the castle, but the gardens are out of this world. Wonder around the large garden and take the seal tour.",
          "Dunvegan Castle is a nice castle, with a some stories about the fairies, such as the fairy flag, but if you have seen a few castles already, it won\u2019t be any different! The 4/5 is for the gardens!!! They were wonderful! You can easily combine this visit to a visit a Neist Point",
          "No so much access to the actual castle just few levels and rooms but the gardens and outside area are stunning. Deffy get a boat trip to islands to see the seals, book into that quickly as we ended up having to wait 4 hrs for next available slot",
          "Very nice place to visit. The garden is amazing and it is fun to discover all \"secret corner\". In the walled garden you can spend hours due to the extreme relaxing path and colours. Ticket is a little bit expensive but in line with the average prices. The car parking is enough",
          "The castle itself lies in a beautiful setting. Compared to other castles there is not so much be to seen within the castle. However, the gardens are really beautiful and worth the visit. An absolute highlight is the boat trip to the seals. Parking large enough, clean restrooms.",
          "The castle was really great. The gardens were unbelievable. For our kids the castle was captivating and held their attention.",
          "This was a great day out-not to be missed! After paying our admission-we headed to the seal trip area first incase there was a line up- didn't have to wait long-awesome experience!! Take your camera! We went out in a small boat with Trevor to see the seal colony - boat leaves",
          "The castle itself is a bit underwhelming but the gardens are lovely, and well kept with the option to take a walk to the pier and take a boat to view some seals. I felt that \u00a314 per person for the castle and gardens was reasonable, but if you want to only access the gardens it's",
          "We had a great day here, even though weather was very wet, we were able to enjoy the gardens and water features as were adequatly dressed.",
          "Nice walk through the gardens. Liked the rooms with the costumes. Could be updated a little. The outdoors gardens are beautiful. The day we visited was extremely nice wonder how it would be in the winter.",
          "Dunvegan Castle & Gardens is grand, and gives you a peek into the life of the past at its grandeur. The gardens are beautifully kept and lovely. There is a place to walk down to the water's edge and take a boat to do some seal watching, fun! The castle itself is packed full",
          "I was disappointed that there were no guided tours available. They said there is too much demand and cannot cope but what's the problem to limit the number of people to bd allowed to have the tour? Well, the money would not be that good if you limit the number of tourist. There",
          "Castle is nice, gardens are better has some really good waterfalls and nice walks. The best part of it was the seal boat trip that is a must, great tour guide giving all the information about the seals and location.",
          "This is a lovely castle on Isle if Skye with an important part of Scottish history linked to it. There is an interesting audio tour guide included with the entrance fee and it is easy and free to move around. The grounds and gardens are also very interesting to walk around .",
          "The castle has a stunning location overlooking the loch. Over the past few hundred or more years the castle, that is still owned by the family, has undergone updates and renovations, which is understandable, but take away some of its authenticity. Great however that a privately",
          "Even when it was a bit raining we enjoyed this beautiful castle. Inside it is amazing and full of historic stuff andvthe gardens are incredible. We even did the boat trip to see the seals and it was well worthy.",
          "I\u2019m torn on this review. I loved the garden, but the castle was meh. We just visited the Eilean Donan castle who had an auditory tour full of history and knowledge, only to come to this castle with no real history provided or information about the castle, which we paid more for.",
          "Crazily overpriced at \u00a314 each. We were done with the castle visit within 30 minutes. All seems a bit contrived. Most rooms were out-of-bounds - and the others? Well you got the usual bedroom, drawing room, dining room, and maids room all conveniently next to one another.",
          "The castle is interesting - although the exterior isn\u2019t really \u201ccastley\u201d - more of a pebble dashed mansion when you get up close. Inside the history is well presented, with good information and lots of good artefacts. There is a nice collection of MacLeod family memorabilia,",
          "We enjoyed wandering the grounds and castle. We were there in June 2018.....no crowds. Quiet, lovely place.",
          "It\u2019s a castle. It\u2019s full of cool old stuff and lots to read on the history of the McClouds. Also had very interesting and varied gardens. Great for adults and children.",

          "A small but interesting historic building the ancestral home of the MacLeods. The castle looks onto the shore where seals can be spotted fishing. The castles gardens are beautiful, especially the \u2018walled garden\u2019 allow plenty of time to explore the gardens and the shoreline.",
          "If you've seen a Scottish castle, you probably don't need to do this one. However, the gardens are beautiful. I would spend my time there.",
          "A delightful castle in stunning gardens with a costal location....what more could you ask for. You can also take some trips out in a boat to see the seals.",
          "Visited castle on a very wet day in July. Met at door by a friendly guide. Lots of interesting artifacts and memorabilia. Outside extensive well kept gardens. Only let down was cafe which had far too many tables and was very crowded.",

          "The castle is somber, even dreary from the outside. Inside is a collection of rooms containing furniture, paintings and other artefacts. Notable are several paintings by Ramsay. In one room a group of young people were playing a selection of Scottish music. They enjoyed it and",
          "We visited the castle in the month of June. I would say the castle is ok ok but the gardens are really beautiful. Only this which bothered us were the small insects/mosquitos flying around.",
          "Our tour offered a stop a the castle, we had already visited Eileen castle who offered a bus tour discount so it was expected that we would receive the same type of discount. The driver inquired and was told rudely that the line was too long and that they did not have the time",
          "Despite the stunning location, Dunvegan was very expensive to visit - \u00a356 for 4 - with not a lot to see unless you are interested in standard good-looking gardens. As a castle experience, the closely located Eilean Donan castle was a much better experience. Cheaper, more",
          "We enjoyed our visit but was quite busy inside the castle. We opted to self tour as there are information sheets in each room. The views are amazing over the water. We were blessed with sunny weather and wandering through the gardens was lovely.",
          "The pictures on the website do not do this justice. What a wonderful castle and gardens. We spent a half day in and around the castle. There is so much to see and explore. The cafe offers a great quick snack as well. The staff are great and the food was tasty",
          "I am fortunate to live close by to Dunvegan castle and have friends of Dunvegan castle cards. I am a frequent visitor and I am always impressed at how beautiful the gardens are. There is always something new to see. The water gardens are wonderful and the walled garden is",

          "We stop here a few times each year as part of our small group tours of Scotland. I love this castle as it had so much history. I also love explaining to our groups how a castle changes throughout the centuries and the different owners putting their mark on the castle. This",
          "Dunvegan Castle is very beautiful, especially the gardens. I highly recommend visiting very early when it opens to avoid too many tourists and to enjoy the early sunrays on the garden. We unfortunately visited when it was raining (Scotland right...). If you can make a visit",
          "At first we were a bit wary of the \u00a314 admission price but once inside you can see why the price is set at this. It was so fascinating and we learnt so much about the history of the castle. The grounds were beautiful and we spent hours wandering around them. Would highly",
          "We visited here with our (nearly) 2 year old, only paying for garden access (it\u2019s only a couple of \u00a3 more for the castle too but we didn\u2019t think it would be suitable/buggy friendly). If you\u2019re into flowers/plants, you\u2019ll love the gardens. They were beautiful, particularly the",
          "Well worth a visit to do house and garden tour and for a little extra, also boats to see seals. Gardens and waterfalls lovely",
          "The gardens were very beautiful and we liked to walk through it. The castle is average. But if you are into gardens it is worth to visit.",
          "We did not get tickets to go inside the castle, but thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful gardens and seals. The boat ride allows one to get very close to the seals, and they are really fun to watch. Would highly recommend the boat trip and perusing the gardens if in the area.",
          "A relatively well maintained castle. Good walking tour of building. Several stairways and steps to navigate. Not for folks that have difficulty walking. Good view of surrounding countryside. The grounds and water gardens are impressive. Could spend three to fours hours there",
          "Whilst on the Isle of Skye we visited Dunvegan Castle. We had a sunny day and the castle looked stunning next to the sea. The gardens were super and quite extensive. The castle itself was steeped in history with lots of interesting items to see. Boat trips from the castle jetty",

          "This castle has an amazing water garden built around a stream and there are paths leading all over the property. Our family enjoyed the walks in the different gardens. Unfortunately, we ran out of time to do the boat tour to see the seals, but we would've spent several more",
          "Having toured the Trotternish Peninsula on our first full day on the Isle of Skye, we headed west the next day from Portree to Dunvegan and were not disappointed. The ride was picturesque and the castle was very interesting. It gave you an excellent glimpse into the history of a",

          "Spent the best part of a day here and thoroughly enjoyed looking around the house and gardens. Everything is well kept and there\u2019s a lot of historical explanation. You can opt to take a boat trip out to see the seals. You may also be able to see them just off the banks. As",

          "I was in Scotland 20 years ago and loved Dunvegan then. I had to see it again this trip and it was even more beautiful. The gardens surrounding the castle all by themselves are so magnificent they are worth the trip. But the inside of the castle is beautiful maintained and",

          "If this is your first castle you will love it. Its big. The gardens are beautiful. But compared to others it kind of sucks. The tour guide barely spoke English and the gist of the tour was telling us how everything was fake or plastic or had no purpose. Go see something medieval",
          "Absolutely stunning gardens - waterfalls, wooden bridges and very well maintained. Castle was interesting, the male attendant was knowledgable, friendly and funny. The female \u201cgreeter\u201d was very pleasant and welcoming. Stunning scenery around the castle. Staff in the cafe",
          "The castle is very beautiful, it would be nice to have more description of the items and the castle\u2019s history. Take time to visit the multiple gardens, well worth it and all the plants are labeled which is a great addition.",
          "We absolutely loved our visit to Dunvegan castle. The gardens were stunning. The staff were so lovely and friendly. We spent hours looking around. Well worth a visit!",
          "When I think of a castle this is what I think of. Full of beautiful things and history. The architectural design is amazing. The gardens are equally beautiful. This has been one of the highlights of our trip.",
          "We visited six castles in Scotland and it was at this castle that we gained a better understanding of clans. The paintings tell stories and we were fortunate to have an excellent guide to point out things of significance. Watching the video is time well spent to put the",
          "amazing place in the isle of Skye, with good interesing interiors and pleasant gardens for a relaxing walks, Excellent scenarios. A must see during thr trip of the isle of skye",
          "The ticket price for this visit would suggest an outstanding castle and although its interesting it is not at the same level as Stirling Castle where excellent guided tours are available. The grounds are well kept and worth a walk around with lovely views out to sea.I enjoyed",
          "The gardens were absolutely stunning! They offer seal viewing boat trips but we didn't do that. The castle was very interesting! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Visited the Isle of Skye on a recent cruise ship stopover in Portree. I agree that the admission price was rather high for what was offered. Fortunately I knew a lot of the history of the place prior to arrival because we also did not have the option of having a guided tour.",
          "I understand the need to upkeep the castle but the price is not matched by what is on offer. Guided tours should be offered as a matter of course and not cancelled regularly at short notice. This can\u2019t detract from an impressive location and a fascinating family history. The",
          "We visited today and were very disappointed with the Castle. The rooms are poorly displayed and there is no history of the castle that I could see. I am sure it has had an interesting past as well as the family\u2019s part in history. The gardens are average. I think it is",
          "Beautiful location and a well laid out set of rooms. gardens lovely too. Car park massive, plenty of space for motorhomes",
          "Can\u2019t believe they charged \u00a314 to look around a poor relation to a castle, more like a very tired museum/stately home. They even wanted the visitors to give even more money as a donation after the visit!!",
          "We visited as it was advertised as a castle. It\u2019s over priced and more like a very small stately home Very poor value for money and a waste of time",
          "Not another bloody castle......but this one is different as it\u2019s gardens are worth the wander and the seal boats are worth the short motor boat cruise.",
          "On Skye one has to visit Dunvegan - not only the magnificent castle but also the beautiful gardens. We were there in the first week of May and the Rhododendrons were in full bloom. To get the most of your visit you should get there early then there is a good chance that the",
          "The castle is well appointed and still lived in. We walked it ourselves and took a 30 min tour and so got a good feel for the castle. They started the castle in the 1200s, but much of what is shown is from the 19th century. Nice family history, with emphasis on the paintings",
          "The castle is located at earth\u2019s end on the Isle of Skye....but well worth the effort if you enjoy castles. The castle has been modernized sufficiently so that one could still live there but has traces of its historical roots. The gardens are great, but not English gardens as",
          "the Dunvegan castle is important to understand the local history. You can go through the castle at your own pace and the descriptions are very good. A lot to see. Reserve also at least a full hour for the gardens, which are lovely. there is a little shop by the pier and a coffee",
          "We planned to just stop and take a picture of the castle and continue on but the castle isn't visible from the carpark. Since we had to pay the entrance fee to enter the gate we wound up touring the castle and gardens. It turned into a lovely morning. The castle itself isn't",
          "So glad we made the time to go and see this grand old castle. The castle itself is beautiful and the surrounding gardens were a delight to walk around. We had some delicious scones with jam and cream in the coffee shop at the car park.",
          "Lovely garden and Loch walks. Small but interesting castle. Good opportunity to go seal watching on a short boat trip from the Loch shore.",
          "Dunvegan Castle is very well done. A definite stop for a tourist. The displays and exhibits are excellent. I learned a lot about Scottish history. My wife thought the gardens were exceptional.",
          "Lovely day spent at the castle and gardens. Lady gardener very knowledgable and helpful. Could be some comfy chairs in the coffee shop!",
          "Loved visiting this castle and it's ties to Bonnie Prince Charlie. I didn't have nearly enough time on our tour to explore fully. I would love to return.",
          "I tripped up the last step going in to the castle and felt like an idiot but the charming young man who was greeting visitors at the door was so funny and kind and helped me recover my dignity! The castle is interesting, we found the Bonnie Prince Charlie and St Kilda displays",
          "Came here to pass some time whilst it was a wet day. \u00a314 to get in....Ouch. It was a limited tour with most areas off limits. It's not even a proper castle !",
          "We visited Easter weekend on the Sunday when it was dull and raining. I was disappointed at how the castle looked as no original brickwork it looks like it has been pebble dashed. It is very dirty on the exterior and looks harsh and uninviting. Inside there is lots to see but",
          "Castle really interesting especially with history that goes with it The gardens are enchanting, well maintained and informative",
          "Dunvegan After paying the entrance fee at the gate, headed straight for the castle. A sign was displayed at the entrance saying due to high visitor numbers there would be no guided tours today. Really?! This was a midweek morning early in May. Had that information been",
          "Self-guided tour around the interior of the castle. Some interesting artifacts here and there to see. My wife was really impressed with the hardwood flooring. Outside around the gardens is really nice. Lots of varieties to see. Most still aren\u2019t in full bloom yet. Everything is",
          "First view of castle disappointing (photos on tourist info looked stunning), interesting history but not recent really. Short film also did not really hit the spot. Gardens nice. Cafe ok but nothing special. As the title says - just average",
          "A wonderful bit of Scottish history and a real gem at the extremity of the Isle of Skye. The gardens are well laid out and the house is full of history and well presented. However the story of the family is not as well told as it might be and the video narrated by Hugh Macleod",
          "Having visited Skye for a number of years we had tried the cafe previously but we were not impressed. So we tried again. The cafe was almost empty at lunchtime. We asked if dogs were allowed (1st time having the dog with us) but they\u2019re not. All tables were taken outside so we",

          "Beautiful Castle and grounds. The falcon show was great. It was cold and windy, but we loved it.\u263a\ufe0f Worth a picture taking moment.",
          "We visited the castle for the first time in some years. It was in a better state of repair and maintenance and looked very smart compared to our previous visit. The gardens were as always well maintained and well worth a good amount of time. However, the cafe seems to have",
          "We had planned to go on a couple of hikes however as the mist was very heavy we were recommended a visit to this castle which wasn\u2019t disappointing! It\u2019s steeped in history and the information on offer is very thorough. The gardens are extensive and there are also seal tours on",
          "We only wanted to see the castle from a distance, based on some of the photos of it that we'd seen. Found it very difficult to achieve this objective as we didn't have a boat or a helicopter. Instead we got the only shot we could from way off in the distance and applied some",
          "Really nice place to visit, the views are amazing and the castle is really interesting. I\u2019d recommend going early as it gets more crowded later in the day, we arrived at 10am when it opens and were able to take photos and explore without being surrounded by people. Overall worth",
          "I came here because of my wife's love of all things castle. But, I am glad I did. Plenty to see inside, a real sense of history, and a lovely garden, even in April. If you are in the area, drop in",
          "Dunvegan is really lovely, has a few rooms on show which are well done. I loved the stories about all the chiefs of clan MacLeod. It is not very big and we were done quite quickly. There were not many staff members to offer information so you are mostly left to your own devices.",
          "Visited the castle during a stay in the castle cottages. Great place full of history, especially if you\u2019re a MacLeod. We visited in early April so the gardens were not in bloom but that\u2019s to be expected. The castle overall is not huge and doesn\u2019t take long to go round. As we",
          "Beautiful castle and fantastic grounds even in April. Walk round the castle to get the views from the sea side. Inside the castle there was a lot to see but very little in the way of info - perhaps you need the guide book- we didn't buy one though. Dougal, a guide in one of",
          "Good place to visit with plenty of info around from the staff. Gardens are beautiful and well kept. Lots of space for kids to run around",
          "The castle is very interesting to see with all its history explained along with portraits of many of its occupants throughout the ages. The gardens are tranquil and beautiful even in April so can only imagine how lovely they\u2019ll be during the summer months. All with the wonderful",
          "Really nice couple of hours, we went for the seal trip as well - wrap up warm it is an open small boat which seats about 6 people. Plenty of seals in the water and on the rocks, which you get quite close to. Colony is about 400 seals so plenty to see. Nice gardens and house",
          "The highlight of the day was the boat trip to see the seal colony. The guide was informative without being too talkative, and got us close enough to see the seals properly but not so close as to disturb them. The gardens were nice, and look to be even better in May once",
          "A reasonably interesting castle and some nice pieces of furniture. Gardens well laid out and setting spectacular.",
          "The castle and grounds and both interesting and beautiful. Lots to see. The highlight was going on a seal boat tour from the lower gardens. Niko was really helpful in the seal ticket shop and our boat guide, Neil, was brilliant. We saw loads of seals and had a wonderful ride",
          "Lovely hours walking around castle and gardens. Staff lovely and know their history. The castle do guided tours but the day we went short staffed .This was not a problem as there was staff in most the large rooms Cheers",
          "The castle was quite a disappointment and overpriced. If you go with a family be prepared to spent around \u00a350. It is not worth the money, certainly not with kids. There are so many castles in Scotland to choose from and I have been to many of them...Dunvegan is definitely not",
          "The gardens are worth the visit, even though very little in bloom at this time of year it was a great walk. The castle was good. The cafe was reasonable.",
          "A great visit to over 700 years of history. Plenty to see and the amazing gardens would be worth a visit on their own. \u00a312 adult entry, plenty of parking. Great facilities on site",
          "Dunvegan castle suffers by comparison to other Scottish baronial structures. We visited here in early April and the gardens were not at all impressive. Others have noted that the gardens will be beautiful when everything is in flower and bloom. No doubt it will be, but \"out of",
          "Visited today. What a cool place. I have seen prettier castles for sure but this is still a cool one to visit. Gardens are fabulous with a cool waterfall and loads of amazing plants.",
          "Was very disappointed after spending \u00a334 on the castle and it's gardens-not much to see! Also was told the seal trip was included with the family ticket but when we went to the boat area were told the opposite and that we would have to pay to go on!!!",
          "Interesting castle & beautiful gardens! Many of the plants were not yet in bloom so I\u2019m sure it will be even more spectacular then.",
          "I only wish we'd had more time here! Dunvegan is definitely the highlight of Skye and there's so much history here. We went on the seal tour twice (totally worth it - the guides have been there for years and know the various seal families!) and toured the castle and gardens. The",
          "Took a quick walk through Dunvegan Castle on a cold and very wet day in April. We skipped the garden, but the castle was nice. There were no tours the day we were there, but there was a knowledgeable and friendly staff member positioned in one of the rooms for questions and",
          "We came with our two children and were not disappointed. It was raining very hard but the gardens were pretty and the staff super friendly. Our boys played the game of \u201cfind the hidden key\u201d and LOVED it.",
          "Even though it was raining on the day of our visit the gardens were still beautiful and we greatly enjoyed our time here. We also toured the inside of the castle - which was lovely - but the gardens were the real highlight of our trip. You can also pay to take a boat trip out",
          "We were here in July 2018, and unfortunately its popularity makes it a bit crowded in the summertime. There were so many people, it was hard to move through some rooms, read the signs, and even harder to take photos of some very unique furniture. We went through it in about an",
          "Very nice castle and gardens to walk around with an optional boat tour to see lots of seals and birds around.",
          "Had read so much about this castle and its history that it was a true joy to actually see the castle. Seeing the 'fairy flag' which is now basically in tatters made the entire trip worthwhile. So much of the clan's history and beliefs abounds around that fairy flag. If you plan",
          "Beautiful place, amazing gardens. Didn't go into the castle this time but the castle grounds were well worth the visit. A lot of interesting trees & plants, and beautiful views across the bay.",
          "Plan to spend some time, do the castle tour, but also spend time in both the gardens and visiting the seals in the bay. Gorgeous",
          "We had an enchanting time walking through the castle and gardens. The castle is in great shape and the garden was very impressive. Definitely worth your time to visit this slice of local history.",
          "We almost skipped this because it was raining out, but so glad we didn't! The castle was quite interesting, but what really stuck with us was the amazing gardens! Even in the rain, we walked for a long time through the many varied gardens. We absolutely loved the grounds.",
          "To be honest, I don't remember much about the castle. What I remember are the gardens!! They were lovely and we spend most of our time slowly strolling through. So many colors and varieties and they all smelled so good. Great gardens!",
          "We were disappointed with the castle itself as it was fairly plain and boring on the outside, and not very impressive on the inside. The furnishings were bland, there didn\u2019t seem to be a great deal of care taken as to who was who in the various paintings, and the presentation",
          "What a great setting and beautiful place to visit. The castle was founded in the 13th century and expanded over the centuries. Eventually in the 19th century it was finished off as a mock medieval castle. For those who love castles, this is a great place to visit. To make things",
          "Went for tour of old castle and it\u2019s garden. Enjoyed the trip but we missed the boat trip as it was raining and not in service.",
          "We recommend a visit, particularly if you enjoy gardens and history. I loved the gardens which even include a reasonably sized waterfall. The interior of the castle is a bit tired in parts. Other reviews recommend the boat trip added on to see the seal colony...maybe next",
          "My husband and I have travelled her twice. Love the beauty and the lay out of the land and all around love the story of Dunvegan Castle and the MacLeod history. Highly recommend a visit. Very hospitable staff and beautiful gardens. We will return.",

          "A lot of castles are beautiful on the outside but this one has more to offer than most, on the inside. Gorgeous paintings of the clan through the centuries. Every room is fully decorated. Worth the trip out there!",
          "What an amazing experience finding Dunvegan Castle and Gardens, the location is spectacular, the gardens are truly stunning and the castle has such a great atmosphere, so warm and welcoming. Highly recommend, so worth the visit.",
          "The castle was small but interesting. The gardens were toward the end of their peak in late September but were lovely. Would love to see them in the Spring.",
          "Definitely worth spending a while wandering the gardens, even in the pouring rain!! Lots of flowers still out in October. Pathways are good around the formal and less formal areas of the garden",

          "We visited the castle on a rainy day with our 4 year old. It was a great idea that on arrival our son was told a game he could play which was to find all the keys and then he would get a prize. It kept him interested throughout and he found all the keys. It was a nice little",
          "Dunvegan Castle is quite impressive. Only a small part of the castle is open to visitors as it is still a family home. The rooms and displays reflect the history of the castle and it's surrounds and you get an insight as to what life would have been like. I found the old",
          "There is not many rooms to visit in the castle but a lot of informations. The staff were very friendly and were interested in hearing about our stay on the Isle of Skye. I wouldn\u2019t say it was worth the \u00a314 entry, until you step out into the gardens. What a beautiful place",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed both the grounds/gardens and castle. It is just beautiful. Everything here is awesome, lovely and well kept. It's like stepping through time. I definitely will visit again when I have more time. We had so many places to see and it's all so beautiful",
          "Worth the drive to the Castle! Garden was still blooming partly. We visited also the Coral Beach which is at the end of a minor road from the castle car park.",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the castle especially as the lovely furnishings and rooms all seemed to have strong family connections. You had the sense that real people actually occupied, and continue to occupy and care about, the castle. While I would have appreciated a",
          "Ticket price was around \u00a311 which included the gardens. Beautiful picturesque castle. Though it was raining, seeing the gardens was well worth it. Tons of different species of flowers, bushes, tree etc. and beautifully laid out and maintained. There is a waterfall water garden",
          "Would highly recommend. We enjoyed this castle Immensely. So much to see, so authentic and a great history lesson!",
          "Interesting to see, nice landscape view from the terrace, the gardens, they are really nice, I could take nice pictures even under the rain.",
          "I am not generally a big fan of castles but I totally enjoyed our trip around Dunvegan Castle. I have seen other reviews criticising the 'homely' nature of this one, but for me this set it apart from others I have been to, where you can read the history but can't really feel or",
          "Although did not think it was worth the \u00a314 entry, the gardens were reasonable and the grounds well kept. the castle was interesting including the largest Elephant tusks (poor animal) in a museum in the world. The castle was well kept and in a nice setting.",
          "Imposing castle kept in super condition. This ancient castle has been the McLeod stronghold for 8 centuries. Tales of Fairy Flags, Family Tiffs, Rebellion and expert Politics are all part of this Castles heritage. Steeped in history it is a fine visit and it\u2019s gardens are just",
          "Not worth the \u00a314 entry fee. Very limited rooms open in the castle, only on one floor. Info in rooms badic but is suppliedin different languages, some sheets old and tatty. Gardens worth a visit and probably the highlight if our visit. Fantastic views. Cafe is located in the car",
          "We were staying in a cottage in Colbost and decided not to miss Dunvegan Castle, in spite of the heavy rain. It turned out to be a beautiful small-scale castle. Nicely decorated. We particularly liked the basement were the staff lived. You could very easily imagine life",
          "If you're visiting expecting to see a grand Scotish castle then you will probably be disappointed. There's a lot of information and history to learn about and a few rooms to see but nothing particularly worth the \u00a314 entrance fee...until you get outside! The views are amazing",
          "This was a pleasant and informative visit. Our welcome was friendly and helpful and the tour and displays well organised. Of particular interest was the documentary film about the Macleods and their history. We didn't have time to do the garden justice but what we saw was",
          "The entire estate is well worth an extended visit......gardens laid out in sections making it are wonderful place in which to wander thru some well maintained corners. Dunvegan Castle is also worth visiting especially if your are a clan member. The interior has been recently",
          "A gale was blowing and rain falling so the gardens were not fully explored. What we did see was lovely. The castle is cosy and beautiful. You will learn all about the Mac donalds. Especially Flora Mc Donald.",

          "Dunevegan Castle is well maintained by the Clan MacLeod. The staff is friendly, you can take pictures inside the castle, there are information sheets in multiple languages in each room, and the gardens are one of the best we saw on our trip to Scotland. There's plenty of",

          "We visited in August 2018 and the walled garden was in full splendor! The design of the garden is very pleasing and the lilies and other perennials were beautiful. I visited the castle 30 years ago and was not disappointed in my return visit. Each room in the castle has an",
          "Small castle with lots of history about the Clan MacLeod. Lovely gardens to walk through. Walled Garden, Round Garden and Water Garden to walk through. Not suitable for people who cannot walk up stairs though. Price to get in \u00a314 per adult.",

          "Visited when Skye was being battered by storms while our outdoor activities were put on hold. There were no tours on the day due to high visitor numbers but this wasn't a problem for us. Plenty to see with information cards in most rooms. A brief break in the weather allowed us",
          "This wasn\u2019t on my list of things to do while I was on the isle of Skye, But I am definitely happy we stopped here. The castle had a great tour and the history of it was very interesting.",

          "I visited the castle at the tail end of my 3 day Skye tour. It was worth a look with spectacular views in some spots along the ramparts. There is an old draw bridge and quaint gardens and grounds. Cost about 6.50 GBP to enter. It's fairly busy with tour busses showing up all",
          "Visited castle today. Beautiful gardens and notable difference in the temperature between the walled garden and the main garden explained why so many flowers were still blooming. Castle rooms very attractive and guides friendly and informative. Plenty of parking excellent value",

          "the garden in august was awesome. Almost all the plants were flowering. It was an explosion of colours. The visit to the castle is good enought. You can see how it is posible nowadays to live in a castle in a comfortable way",
          "We had a great time here when we visited yesterday! The castle itself is small and will only take about an hour to go around, however the decor inside is spectacular. The portraits that are spread throughout the castle are excellent, and there are very precise information cards",
          "Visited Dunvegan Castle during our tour of Skye. We had a great time wandering through the gardens then through the castle. Well worth the money as we were there for about 3 hours, plus it didn\u2019t rain !! Gift shop was well stocked and people friendly.",
          "Wasn't really sure what to expect as hasn't looked into the castle much beforehand. We arrived about 10am and had to wait in a really long line for tickets (\u00a314 for adults for castle and gardens, \u00a312 for just garden, \u00a311 for students and seniors and can't remember for children)",
          "Enjoyed our time at Dunvegan Castle. Loved touring the Castle and spent a good hour touring the Gardens. Very pretty area.",
          "The Castle and grounds were lovely. Castle quite intimate I thought as rooms much smaller than normal castles. Cosy feel to it. Gardens were very pretty and I am sure on a dry day you could spend a little more time in them wandering around the different areas.Cost I guess is",
          "What a beautiful Castle. It was a beautiful day and the drive there was gorgeous. A must see when you are visiting Isle of Skye!",
          "The castle still looks fantastic. The tour gives a good picture of life in the castle through the ages. The huge garden also looks beautiful. During our visit there was also a demonstration with falcons and a hawk. This demonstration gives a good picture of hunting with birds.",
          "Visit the house first if it's raining ! Allow at least an hour for the house. Then about an hour for the gardens. The boat seal trips take 30 mins but be aware they are in exposed small boats with no shelter so you will be wet and chilled. Plenty of seals though. The little",
          "Gardens are well worth a wander even for non gardeners such as myself. Castle is well laid out and visitor control is efficient, brief history in every room in 5 or 6 languages.",
          "This castle is one of the main attractions in Isle of Skye. Entry fee is \u00a314 for garden and castle. It is an ok castle overall. The garden attract more visitors. Seeing this castle is good for those who are interested in the family history of the MacLeod Clan who resided there.",
          "We visited the castle in August and thought it was one of the best castle we had visited . It also has great gardens",
          "We visited Dunvegan Castle this week. Its nice but over priced. We had a running joke that it is the nicest council house on Skye because it is covered is horrid rough-cast which makes it look less of a castle. The rooms were nice and interesting though. A shame there were no",
          "You can visit quite a bunch of rooms in the castle and the gardens are huge and beautiful. The view to the castle from the shore is beautiful.",
          "Very beutiful gardens and a very intresting and exciting castle. You can imagine how the castle life were lived 100 to 200 years ago. Visit the shop at the carpark after your castlevisit, then you get 15% discount when you show your ticket.",
          "Visited the castle on a cool rainy morning. Free car parking and then a walk of about 400 metres over fairly rough driveway to the castle. Would be difficult for wheelchairs of strollers. Cost is GBP14 for adults and GBP11 for seniors to view the castle and the gardens.",
          "Fabulous great value for money day out. Beautiful Castle steeped in History. Gardens & Waterfalls stunning. We also took a boat trip from the Castle grounds to see a Colony of Seals, the trip lasted around 30 minutes and very children friendly. We saw around 200 seals very close",
          "Bit of a drive, but on Skye most things are really not that far. Dunvegan Castle holds a fascinating amount of history and has been the ancestral home of the MacLeod Clan for about 800 years. There is much online regarding the castle, but the history of the family itself is",
          "A lot of people have talked about the entrance fee but to be honest I think \u00a314 is pretty average and, considering what you get for your money I don't think it's bad. I found some of the rooms really interesting, particularly the library and the room with the items relating to",
          "While the castle building isn\u2019t much to look at the views looking up from the yellow seaweed lined shore are impressive. The best part of the visit was the wonderful gardens and grounds.",
          "We didn\u2019t enjoy our visit to the castle as we found the exhibits to be dated with little information. There was not much that actually explained the history of the castle in an understandable way and nothing on the current people who call the castle home. There was mention of",
          "We went to Dunvegan on a rainy day. The car park was pretty full, but the house appeared to cope well with the volume of visitors. \u00a314 each for adults - so what do you get for a visit? The castle is interesting with four or five major rooms on show. There\u2019s plenty of",
          "This was a good day out. It was quite busy when we arrived and we had to seach a bit for a parking space. The seal visit was excellent- go straight down when you arrive to book a slot and then enjoy the castle gardens while you are waiting. The boats are small and take only a",
          "The castle was very good to go through however the various gardens were absolutely stunning. There was such a large variety of plants bursting in colour. It was a gardeners delight and far better than most castle grounds. Bravo to those who plan and maintain these grounds.",
          "This was on ok castle, interesting but nothing rally special. The gardens on the other hand were very special. The gardens were divided up into several areas and very different in style and plantings, There was even a beautiful waterfall and stream in one area. It started",
          "Young or old, couples or families - this is a great day out for everyone. The castle and gardens are beautiful. I loved the paintings in particular. The staff were very knowledgeable and obliging in answering questions about the history. We also did the seal spotting trip, which",
          "This was our second visit. Unfortunately the weather wasn't great so we concentrated on the castle rather than the gardens. Fascinating history of the MacLeod family. Entrance is \u00a314 which is a bit high but, on a good weather probably worth it!",
          "We arrived at Dunvegan Castle and gardens when they opened so that we could get there before the large coach buses of tourists arrived. There were no guided tours during our visit because of the volume of tourists. I was disappointed about this, but very pleasantly surprised to",
          "Dunvegan is a smallish castle, with a number if decorated rooms and interesting artifacts. The architecture reveals that the castle was build over time....there are very old areas, and some that are much newer. The current generation of the original owners still live part",
          "Just as my title said this is a stunning location to visit. The only thing that let it down was the rude young man who was serving customers for tickets. He just barked at us and huffed when the couple before us who couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying as he was mumbling (they",
          "There were a few rooms to look around in decorated from the periods they represented with the history of the family and individuals that lived there. Gardens were clean, well maintained and signposted.",
          "A family still lives in the castle so it is well preserved and taken care of. It is interesting to see all the family lines printed and portraits throughout the castle.",
          "We visited Dunvegan Castle on a rainy miserable day and the gardens still looked spectacular, however we had a pram and our eight week old daughter and the grounds and castle aren\u2019t pram friendly. We would\u2019ve put her in the sling had we been told at the gate so missed the castle",
          "A place to visit when you are at the Isle of Skye. Seat of one of the two clans that ruled the island, the Mc Loads. Interesting history that goes back from the middle ages to the first half of the 20th century. Nice gardens. Make sure you don\u2019t miss the fairy flag in the castle!",
          "After seeing this monument in so many movies, and in original Highlander movie, couldn't help but pay a visit. Home of the clan MacLeod. The surrounding view is very scenic, with a nearby town along the water. Mountains also circle the area beyond the loch. Inside the castle had",
          "Well, it is a bit of a way from the Scottish mainland, but it's well worth the journey and the entrance fee. Check the weather first - do the gardens whilst it's good, then do the inside. Cannot fault the staff, so polite, helpful and VERY knowledgeable. If you are considersing",
          "This was one of my favorite castles to visit in Scotland. It occupies a charmed corner of the world, tucked in along the water and framed by acres of gardens. Dunvegan is remote and that\u2019s part of its appeal. But it is also lived in. There is a family history there that seems",
          "Visited the castle and we did the seal boat trip first. Very good trip and you get quite close to the seals, go to the boat house first ad trips get booked up very quickly. Lovely walk around the castle too.",
          "This place is a must if visiting Skye. Gardens are stunning! The castle is really interesting and is a good value day out.",
          "The gardens are varied (walled garden, waterfalls, formal garden) and the house is interesting with its history of the McLeod clan. Make sure you do the 30 minute seal boat trip as you are guaranteed to get close to them. Loads of parking and if you drive on past the castle,",
          "lovely gardens the ruined castle has a fence round it as at the moment part of it is unsafe. museum has lots of interesting items in it",
          "This castle was a bit disappointing after just seeing Blair Castle. The rooms and presentations are not nearly as impressive. However, we probably enjoyed the gardens here more. They are extensive and lovely. The castle also looks much more imposing/beautiful from the water",
          "Think we were expecting a bit more, gardens are nice but not very big so it doesn\u2019t take you long to walk round, castle again didn\u2019t take us long to get round, it was nice but for us it\u2019s not a must visit",
          "Nice castle, nothing amazing in here but passed half an hour. Gardens were very well kept and passed another half an hour quite pleasantly but wouldn't bother going out of my way to go here and at \u00a314 each seemed very expensive, as are most of the attractions we've paid into so",
          "If you have ever wondered how history lived, look no further than Dunvegan Castle. This idyllic location on the water will take you back with its authentic decor, moving stories in paintings and in print. The MacLeod Family and their amazing historical home will engage all",
          "A very good experience. Interesting presentation of exhibits and history of the castle and impressive gardens in a picturesque setting on the shores of the Loch where you can spot seals or take a boat trip for a closer look.",
          "Beautiful gardens, the gardeners have to be congratulated on the work they have put in to make them so attractive. However, very disappointed in the castle, not worth the entry price of \u00a314, would recommend only paying to visit the gardens. I would give this 5 stars for the",
          "Was \u00a314 per person and after visiting Eilean Donan Castle for \u00a37 per person we decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. It couldn\u2019t be any more impressive than Eilean Donan anyway! We just drove up past the entrance on the one way street and got some nice photos of the castle from there. We",
          "I was a little bit underwhelmed by the castle but found the history with the fairies and Bonnie Prince Charlie fascinating. There were tour guides there but they didn\u2019t \u201coffer\u201d much guidance. My husband loved the castle however. On the other hand, the water garden was",
          "This place was packed with foreign tourists and we were lucky to be able to walk freely around as most of them went outside to listen to a pipe band (from Canada!) As it was so busy, there were no tours which was a shame. It's not cheap at \u00a314 a head and if I'm honest, I prefer",
          "It\u2019s the height of the season so we expected it to be busy, but it was cramped inside the castle and they could do with limiting numbers. Guide said there was information and guides to help but nothing was around and so we had to wander with little to guide us. Not much to see",
          "This is a nice stop off for an hour, and is certainly interesting, but at \u00a314 per person it\u2019s a little expensive for what it is. Worth considering, but not an absolute must in my view.",
          "Castle tour is interesting although not extensive. Interesting family history and well told. Gardens are extensive and lovely; worth spending time to explore. A highlight was the short trip (additional fee) out on a small boat to see the resident seals and herons on Loch",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this castle. The gentleman posted in the grand hall spoke for a very long time about the history of the castle and it was very interesting. It was a beautiful place to be in and I loved walking through the historical halls. I particularly liked",
          "It was raining, so we didn\u2019t do the garden or any seal trips. The castle itself is nice, but you only see a few rooms, so in less than 20 minutes we were done. Not a lot for 14 \u00a3 a ticket.",
          "Beautiful gardens, but only a small section of the castle is open to the public, so it makes the \u00a314 entry fee a little expensive. The castle shop prices were pretty steep too. None the less, a very pleasant afternoon can be spent enjoying the vast gardens and woodland areas :)",
          "The prices for entry are outrageous, while we were waiting in a queue to pay to get in we seen a few families look at the prices and then walk away back to their cars, and to be honest I wish we'd done the same. The castle was average at best and it only takes a maximum of 10",
          "Great castle well worth the money the staff know lots about the castle and Scottish history in general. Alexander was especially very helpful and a great guide",
          "Dunvegan Castle and Gardens makes for a wonderful day out and we loved every minute of it! We did the seal trips: the guide was extremely informative and we loved seeing the seals up close. The gardens were well maintained and absolutely stunning. The castle itself was a great",
          "Not the most stunning of Scottish Castles, but it was none the less a very interesting one to visit. Interestingly the gardens were more of an attraction to me. The circular garden and the walled garden are brilliantly maintained and growing an amazing variety of plants in quite",
          "The gardens here are beautiful and are separated into various sections such as walled garden and the water garden. Everywhere you look there is something to see. At the castle entrance we were met by one of the friendliest and informative members of staff at a castle. I told",
          "We were very pleasantly surprised to find a real variety of activities here. After coffee in the cafe in the car park we visited the castle. I understand that when it is less crowded, there are guided tours, but we were able to go at our own pace and follow the information",
          "Dunvegan Castle is interesting as an example of a Castle that is still held by the head of the clan. You get a lot of history of the clan and can see a lot of their artifacts.",
          "Dunvegan castle has a long history and may have significance for skye. From a tourist visit perspective it appears very ordinary, with entry fees being excessive. The castle is not an architectural masterpiece, but rather grey and heavy, rebuild as it has been over many years.",
          "My friends and I found the castle tour to be a little underwhelming due to its smallness but enjoyed its surprising quirks. Definitely tour the gardens while you're there as they're quite beautiful and diverse.",
          "We took a walk here last week. The gardens were well worth a visit. The water gardens and the wlex garden s were famous. The house was very busy so there was no your. What was a huge pity was there was a really amazing till about the history. Hubby and I really enjoyed what",
          "Take a look at where Dunvegan is located on Google Maps and you'll probably say, 'What?\" Yes, it's 'out there' at the western tip of the Isle of Skye, and many travel mags are now saying that Skye is so overrun with tourists that the roads are too congested. Not on the day we",
          "Well it was a little bit dark mood in the castle. It was interesting to follow a Scottish clan and its history. Nice staff to help you if you had questions.",
          "Great afternoon...I know it's not free but it's worth every single pound. Don't.miss the boat trip. Go for it if the weather is nice you can easily spend 4to5 hrs in there.",
          "We visited Dunvegan as a family. Upon entering the castle, we were greeted and my children (ages 6. & 9) were sent on a scavenger hunt around the castle. What fun they had! The castle is beautiful and well worth the time. The gardens are wonderful and unique. Be sure to plan",
          "One of the most interesting historic houses I have ever visited. Some stunning portraits by Raeburn and Zoffany. Thank you letters from Dr Johnson and Sir Walter Scott. Lots more interesting artefacts and well documented The gardens are glorious and the boat ride out to the",
          "This castle is still occupied by the 33rd Earl. The clan history was very interesting and the place is gorgeous. The gardens invite a ramble and the castle itself is well worth a tour. The portraits there were really interesting to us. Well worth a visit. Recommended.",
          "Refurbished in 2008 the castle itself is amazing. Completely furnished, it is the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Scotland. Be sure to look in the library for whole shelves of beautiful books printed just for Dunvegan. The gardens are extensive and you could wander",
          "My partner and I visited last month and were very pleased with our visit. The castle and gardens are lovely, but by far the best bit of the visit was seeing the seals. It costs a little more to take the boat out to see the seals - I think it was \u00a37.50 per person, but it was so",
          "Well worth the drive from Portree if not for the gardens alone. Wonderful variety of trees, shrubs and flowers, pity the weather was not better.",
          "This is a really lovely 'compact' castle and grounds to visit even if you don't have a lot of time as it's not sprawling or vast but there's still plenty to see. There's also a very nice cafe on site.",
          "Due to limited time we were unable to go inside the castle grounds however we managed to discover that when you continue to drive past the castle entrance you come to a few lay-bys which give you great views of the castle and good for taking pictures. We were also fortunate to",
          "The castle is very interesting, full of good info, and has very warm approachable and helpful staff. The gardens are fantastic, very beautiful and well tended and maintained. Scenery outside absolutely stunning. Cafe across the street is very very good",
          "My husband's maternal great-grandfather was a MacLeod from Dunvegan, so we had to 'hold fast' and travel from Killin to the Isle of Skye and then back to Fort William in one day, but it was well worth the visit. What a beautiful and historic place. The castle is so",
          "Dunvegan Castle and Gardens is well worth the stop. It was a lovely place to stop, have a quick bite to eat at the caf\u00e9 across the street from the castle, and then take tour of the rooms. It was gorgeous inside and out. The family has taken care of the castle and gardens. A",
          "Looking around, browsing in the allowed rooms and reading all there is to read about the MacLeod Clan is very educating. One of my friend is a MacLeod of Raasey Island from his mother's side and we saw a painting of one of his ancestor in the great hall.",
          "Lovely place and beautiful garden not to mention the cute seals you can see on boat trips. Worth to visit the castle!",
          "This castle sits on the coastline on the Isle of Skye. The current clan chief of the MacLeod clan still resides there. You can visit some of the bedrooms, dining room and parlors. The lower lever gives you the servant and kitchen quarters. The best part of the castle is the",
          "We had precooked our tickets, so were able to enter once the gates opened. Lovely self guided tour through the castle with info cards in most of the room if more info was needed. Fascinating story about the clan's Fairy Flag. Afterwards,we toured most of the gardens which are",
          "In order to see the seals, you need to book castle and garden tickets, so the cost per head amounts to about \u00a320. Which is not cheap. However, the castle and its location is truly stunning, and the boat ride to see the seals was SO worth it. Probably lasted 20 mins or so, with",
          "We went to the castle on a rainy day but it was still worth it. The castle itself is interesting but for us the main attractions were the gardens and the seal boat trip (costs a bit extra). Our seal trip was led by a very knowledgable guide and we were there at the right time of",
          "Well worth visiting if you\u2019re up on the Isle of Skye. Take a wonder through the castle at the history, you can also take a walk around the beautiful gardens which are beautifully maintained.",
          "This beautiful castle is a must see! I stopped in on the way back from Skye and loved everything about it. Rich in history, beautiful inside and you can take a tour that gives you all the information. But I also enjoyed the stunning grounds around the castle. Gardens and water",
          "Beautiful castle and lovely gardens, but the real gem of the day is the boat trip out to see the local seal colony. The 30min trip is the perfect length and our skipper was very knowledgeable about the seals and the local area. We visited in late June in the middle of the",
          "I'm sure this castle is stacked in history however remarkable I just felt that the castle inside felt too modern and didn't feel like it had been restored in keeping with history. \u00a314 to visit the castle and gardens for what you see is a little bit steep too",
          "We visited the castle after seeing most other attractions on Skye so took a chance on the \u00a314 entrance fee, but it\u2019s really not worth that much money. The gardens are pretty but there\u2019s not much to the castle at all, and there is so many lovely things to see on Skye for free, I",
          "Being more interested in animals than castles, I enjoyed the trip by boat to see the colony of seals more than I did the castle. A boat takes you around to see the groups of seals resting on little islands in the waterway. Loved seeing them at (relatively) close quarters. The",
          "Dunvegan is a beautifully maintained historic home. The present head of the clan still lives there. The gardens are also beautifully maintained and worth the visit.",
          "Visited on a rainy day, and thought the place would be crowded and touristy. But the staff was warm and welcoming, and the castle and gardens interesting and beautiful. I'd also like to say that the gift shop was probably the best gift shop we saw during our 16 days in Scotland,",
          "Skip the inside and just visit the gardens. They have done a lot of renovations, therefore, you don\u2019t get that old castle feeling. Feels more like a museum. gardens are lovely.",
          "The self-guided tour was easy to follow and there were laminated sheets in several languages in each room. The library was particularly interesting, from the impressive collection of first editions to the ingenious armchair that converted to a set of steps to reach higher",
          "Very well maintained building although looks a bit dowdy on the exterior. Lovely gardens and very good gift shop and restaurant. An oasis in a pretty ordinary village.",
          "The castle itself was fascinating and the room guides and staff were all very welcoming and helpful. The gardens were a total surprise and truly wonderful! We easily spent several hours there. Well worth a visit and good value.",
          "The gardens are lovely and worth a visit, the house is quite interesting but more a grand house than a castle. The gift shop is outrageously expensive - I bough a Harris Tweed handbag for over \u00a360 cheaper at another venue on the island. Save your money folks, you can likely get",
          "For our group, the primary interest in going to Dunvegan was the magnificent gardens. The castle is OK, particularly if one has family connections to the MacLeods, but the gardens are simply not to be missed. Early June had the color peaking, and the walled garden area was",
          "The castle itself wasn't that impressive , a average stately home. The gardens more than make up for this , they are spectacular. I would say it is a little overpriced, but that can be said for most of Skye.",
          "Nicely restored castle, and worth the visit, but it's a odd mix of an authentic castle, and a weak museum and gift shop. It's worth a visit if you're around this area of Skye, but an hour is plenty of time to invest here.",
          "Initially I was disappointed with the look of the castle from the outside but you would really miss a trick if you didn't go inside. The rooms are lovely with lots to see and the connection to certain aspects of Scottish history very interesting. The guides are helpful and",
          "Paid visit to this castle as part of our family visit to Skye. Ample parking available. Was allowed to wander through castle at our leisure and took in all the interesting history attached to this castle. Spent quite a bit of time in the castle before wandering round the",
          "This castle is small, but the gardens are beautiful and it\u2019s history is really interesting. They have boat tours (weather permitting) that take you out to see seals up close. I didn\u2019t have a chance to go, but tour mates showed me pictures and raves about it. We had three hours",
          "Interesting and well worth coming. Bring the midge spray though! More a stately home than castle inside but iconic from the outside and has a lot of interesting things to do. Gardens are well looked after and pretty.",
          "Easy to find and a big car park. Quite expensive but entered under student discount so came to \u00a311, quite reasonable. Its got stunning gardens, lots and lots of variety and walks to explore. There are boat tours for seal spotting available too. The castle is very interesting",
          "At \u00a311 a head it is quite expensive to visit but on a par with many National trust properties these days. Walk from the large car park across the top of the gardens to reach the main door of the Castle. The castle has one or two interesting features - spiral staircase which is",
          "Dunvegan offers an interesting insight to the Macleod clan and it's history however not a whole lot else. This suits me to an extent as I'm a fan of history. However I'm not a fan of the price. Eilean donan castle is almost half the price for much the same experience in my",
          "So we had had some bad experiences exploring Scottish castles so were somewhat hesitant about going to one more medieval castle. Well Dunvegan Castle is well worth the time and entrance fee. The interpreters were so helpful with our questions. The inside looks like a castle,",
          "Visited these wonderful gardens today with our dog. So impressed! Probably the most beautiful gardens we've ever visited, and in such a stunning setting. The staff are very friendly and helpful as well. So glad you allow dogs, otherwise we couldn't have come - take note RHS!",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this castle. There were many detailed rooms to visit, as well as unique points of interest such as a dungeon that was placed close to the kitchen so that the imprisoned person could smell the food as he starved to death. It also included some exhibits",
          "Dunvegan was fabulous, pretty gardens, good shop and interesting castle that was very well maintained and homely. However what set this apart from the many castles we saw was the seal spotting tour. We headed out in a small motor boat just out into the harbour. There are many",
          "The garden this time is amazing!! And the made the whole visits worth it. It\u2019s wonderfull, and an unbelievable amount of species of plants. Th castle is not the most romantic from outside, but ok history inside , and you see that the owners do a lot to take care of the",
          "Dunvegan Castle is one of the most recognizable locations in Skye. It is also quite easy to navigate to, especially for foreign travelers. The property was very crowded with tourists when we visited but there is ample free parking. The grounds are well kept and the staff were",
          "Beautiful Gardens for strolling, we stopped and chatted with a very lovely gardener about some of the local plants. The castle itself was beautifully kept and full of history.",
          "It\u2019s a few years since we visited the castle and gardens here. We picked a beautiful sunny day for our visit and started off with a cup of tea in the cafe. The cafe - situated in the car park we had a cuppa to start our visit, we received a warm welcome from a young gentleman (a",
          "Dunvegan Castle is well worth a visit. The gardens are beautiful, the docents are all friendly and ready to answer questions, and were helpful to my mom who needed a chair to sit on in some of the larger rooms to rest her legs (there are stairs and it may be a bit taxing for",
          "This was an unexpected delight. A long drive along some very pot holed roads but well worth it when you get there. Not only the castle but the gardens as well. Definitely make sure you do the trip to the north of the island to see this little gem.",
          "The Castle is a museum that explain the whole history of the McLeod clan. It\u2019s nit a breathtaking castle, but is quite interestto see the objects and the way the Castle was constructed along the years. The grounds are something else. At least two are amazing, the water garden",
          "The way I titled my review makes it sound like I had expected the worst or very little but that's not true. I titled it that way because I had, honestly, never really heard that much about Dunvegan Castle (as compared to Eilean Donan Castle and others) until I started",

          "We went on a wet and miserable day. The castle itself was underwhelming to say the least, not as big as we thought it was going to be. It was raining so we didn\u2019t go in the seal boats because we didn\u2019t want to be wet and cold. The walk around the gardens were nice but was pretty",

Maybe you could add some questions about the castle so they can learn more about the castle, it\u2019s owners and the historie. The boattrip was nice, but also maybe",
          "Scotland is utterly awash with stately homes and gardens, and living on the Moray Firth coast I'm lucky enough to get to see a lot. Dunvegan Castle I have to say isn't one of the most fascinating. There's certainly nothing wrong with it, but it has to be said it's an ugly old",

          "Instead of going straight to the castle, we took several different paths off the main walk to see the woods, rhododendrons (which must be beautiful when in bloom), and finally to an overlook that gave us a good picture of the castle and the water. The castle is a self tour of",

          "The castle itself was quite nice, though not particularly good-looking from the outside. The garden on the other hand was beautiful. Absolutely worth going.",
          "Not only are the gardens brilliant, but if you go down the path to the beach there is a chance you will see the seals. There's also a seal tour where employees take you out on boats. It's a great place for everybody!",
          "Been to many castles,this one not really that impressive. Great gardens, really beautiful. As it's only extra \u00a32 to visit castle on top off visit garden price so worth it I guess.",
          "Very beautiful and well maintained. Worth visiting if you are keen on history.",
          "A beautiful castle in gorgeous gardens. The castle itself is well looked after and there\u2019s plenty of information inside. The displays are well organised and you can spend ages looking at each piece. \n\nThe gardens are wonderful but I\u2019d make \u2026",
          "Such a lovely surprise- the castle had lots of interesting history speckled throughout, but the gardens were the real star of the show. Stunning landscape, clearly created over years by a very talented team. Incredibly enjoyable, and a source of inspiration for our own home gardening now!",
          "This imposing castle is very busy with tourist coaches so for a peaceful meander try and get there early. If you a fan of Scottish heritage here you will be enthralled. The clans contribution to British armed forces history is highly commendable.",
          "The food was amazing at their cafe. The staff was friendly. The gardens were amazing and well worth the additional charge. The castle was pretty cool and the whole experience provides some great photo memories. I recommend this.",
          "An amazing experience. If you have enough time to explore the isle of Skye, I highly recommend this to you. The gardens around the castle are really nice, you can walk and spend lovely and peaceful time around the castle",
          "Gardens very dull cos they are well... Gardens - how exciting can it be? However the seal trip is totally awsome :-) really great - tiny little boat with knowledgeable guide and get within a metre or so of the seals! Really recommend the seals and forget the gardens :-)",
          "Got there early and missed the crowds , had a great walk around the castle and the gardens. History and flowers what more can you ask for when your a castle fan with a camera. They also have boat trips out to see the seals. Overall it was a worthwhile visit",
          "A very interesing castle, with average gardens, and an excellent seal-watching boat trip as an extra.\n\nI planned to visit the castle only for the seal watching trip initially and was very disappointed it was an extra to a fairly highly \u2026",
          "Lovely place,this is the second time we've been here and it's still worth a visit, also it's just up the road from Jan's cakes which make the best cakes I've ever had. So you have two reasons to go to this part of the island.",
          "Very nice garden and nice castle. However I would not say it was worth the price. Go if you love history and want to learn about the past.",
          "Fabulous Castle with Amazing Gardens very well cared for with some stunning flowers and the waterfalls are breathtaking! Highly recommended you take the walk around all the gardens and down to the seal trip makes lovely photos looking back \u2026",
          "A very lovely place to visit. Interesting walking tour if taken but if not, there is more than enough to see and learn in the rooms themselves. Beautiful gardens and waterfront views around the property as well.",
          "This castle is situated on a small cliff on the Isle of Skye, you can also visit it inside, where you will find the properties of a Scottish family, with also medieval testimonies. It is nestled in a large garden, here the best way to \u2026",
          "Dunvegan Castle & Gardens are open from 1 April until 31 October. Coffee and souvenirs shop are close of other times of the year.",
          "Fabulous old castle with beautiful scenery, and even seals down on the Rocky beach.",
          "Nice gardens and the castle is nice but its not a traditional old castle its been modernized and has had a lot of changes. If your passing and have some time then stop but i wouldn't if your pushed for time you wont miss much. Enjoy people\ud83d\ude00",
          "Nice place. Good gardens. Castle needs more history explaining. Entrance fee is overpriced.",
          "Realy nice castle to visit. The gardens are lovely to explore with many exotic plants and waterfalls.",
          "Lovely day out. Gardens are outstanding, even in September. Castle was modest for a castle, but interesting all the same :-)",
          "Lovely gardens and fine castle. I particularly enjoy the boat trips out to see the seals lazing on the rocks. You get so close to these magnificent animals and the guide is informative too.",
          "We went on the fishing trip. Wonderful. Experienced, friendly, calm boatmen. Unbelievable views, plenty of fish, plenty of seals and birds to watch too.",
          "Lovely place, the Castle is good and some great views. Look out for seals, we spotted them without the boat trip. ( I'm not great on little boats )",
          "Lovely castle of the MacLeods. Worth a visit. The castle offers many rooms to explore and the gardens are just wonderful.",
          "Lovely Castle and gardens, tour was good and interesting. Cafe good food and prices not to bad. Gift shop was better than most tourist attractions around. Good car park.",
          "Loved this castle and garden visit.  Amazing history and artifacts animated by very good moderators who are stationed around the castle.   Really enjoyed our time there.  The gardens are beautiful.",
          "Very interesting visit to the castle. Very much enjoyed the gardens which were immaculately maintained with lots of well labelled garden plants. Would recommend a visit. Probably a bit expensive for a family.",
          "Beautiful Castle and scenery. Great photo spot. The seal tour is worth it as there are many seals in the water! You can also drive past the castle and see the seals from the coast not too far down the road.",
          "Took the self guided tour through the castle and gardens.  Great historical context of the castle and family through the ages. The gardens are more extensive than I was expecting and quite impressive. Well worth the trip!",
          "Worth the drive. The gardens are great. It has waterfalls just like the fairy pools. But less walking",
          "The water gardens are amazing, the rest is ok. \n\nSeems rediculous that they would place a donation box for castle maintenance after charging 14\u00a3 to get in there. Guess you can never have too much.",
          "A unique Castle with botanical gardens that are amazing.",
          "Nice castle from inside. Beautiful garden, must see if you like british gardens.",
          "Great historical place to visit. Lots of facts and the tour guides in the rooms were knowledgeable \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude0a lovely gardens to walk around also",
          "Beautiful garden and interesting castle tour. It may be worth the money if you are a McLeod descendant.",
          "Nice castle, interior is absolutely \"fake\" to entertain the tourists, you won't get the true, old castle experience. Gardens are very pretty though, but too expensive for what it's worth. I suggest to just do the gardens and get the nice view from the castle on the outside.",
          "The castle was absolutely stunning in a lovely setting, a must visit history and horticulture lovers",
          "The castle wasn't as big as I thought but the garden was massive and had a lot of beautiful flowers. It's a little pricey in my opinion (\u00a314 per adult and \u00a311 for students) but you can see the money does go to maintaining it especially the garden.",
          "Beautiful grounds to walk around with a well kept castle full of history.",
          "I think \u00a314 us a little high \u00a37 more realistic.Gardens are lovely",
          "So glad we made the time to go and see this grand old castle. The castle itself is beautiful and the surrounding gardens were a delight to walk around. We had some delicious scones with jam and cream in the coffee shop at the car park.",
          "Brilliant day out. The gardens are absolutely beautiful",
          "Think they are in the process of renovating the castle as only a couple of floors were open for viewing. Pretty bleak, but it does have some lovely gardens. Worth a visit.",
          "Lovely place and the exhibit inside is nice. You can go see the seals beneath the castle. Great gardens.",
          "Lovely castle, tickets where a bit overpriced.  The exhibitions in the castle were a bit underwhelming - you cannot explore that many rooms in the castle as a lot of it is still private. Beautiful gardens though!",
          "We only visited the cafe as the Castle was too expensive. The food was great though.",
          "Gardens were worth the money. A lot of the castle seemed to be under renovation. The master bedroom and dining hall were spectacular. The rest was disappointing, but ok.",
          "nice historical place with a lot of family historical information about the McLeod clan. Nice garden too. Must visit when on the isle of Skye!!",
          "Nice location but the castle is a not well maintained, a pity given the great history happening there!",
          "I truly loved this castle set on skye",
          "One of the most beautiful castles in Scotland! Especially garden and the outside view are astonishing! If you are on the Isle of Skye you should visit it.",
          "The entire property was beautiful. It seems like you go back in time",
          "Good parking area which something of a rarity on Skye. Toilets, cafe and shop in car parking area which is always useful. You cross over the road to pay for entry to  the castle and gardens. We opted for the self guided tour which suits us \u2026",
          "The garden is superb in springtime. Inside the castle there is a claymore made out of Scottish steel that is fascinating. \nHowever, the admission price lives up to the hype.",
          "The castle is really nice and the gardens are beautiful. A bit weird that there's a donation box for maintenance, even though entrance is 15\u20ac for an adult.",
          "Dunvegan Castle is very beautiful, especially the gardens. I highly recommend visiting very early when it opens to avoid too many tourists and to enjoy the early sunrays on the garden. We unfortunately visited when it was raining (Scotland \u2026",
          "Great day out,dog friendly in the castle grounds. But you cant take dogs into the castle. Stunning scenery,helps when the weather is good!",
          "Fantastic castle and gardens, I really liked it and found its history very interesting. They didn't do tours on the day we visited, there was a sign explaining it was due to the castle being too busy, it didn't feel that busy though, maybe \u2026",
          "Lovely Gardens. Lots to see and do",
          "Lovely castle and gardens! I loved all the history of the castle!\nNice to see it so well looked after! The gardens are stunning!",
          "Beautiful place all around. Couple of gardens, possibility for a seal trip and an astonishing castle! Enough parking spots, toilets and places to eat makes this a great tourist attraction.",
          "Dunvegan Castle and Gardens makes for a wonderful day out and we loved every minute of it! We did the seal trips: the guide was extremely informative and we loved seeing the seals up close. The gardens were well maintained and absolutely \u2026",
          "The garden was magnificent! Magical! I could spend a lot of time looking at all the flowers.",

          "Nice and beautiful castle. Spacious but with a lot of tourists.",
          "The best castle we have seen so far. Breathtaking views. Lovingly lived in and restored. Well worth the fee.",
          "If its raining Castle is a option. But to be honest we spent more time outside in the gardens then actually inside. Only part of it is open for visitors. 14 pounds per person to get in to gardens and castle. Big car park",
          "Loved our visit to Dunvegan castle, the grounds are lovely. Dogs are allowed in the gardens and the setting is magical",
          "I loved it. Beautiful place. Worth a visit",
          "Stunning castle, beautiful gardens, and you can go for a boat ride to see the seals that chose the loch surrounding the castle as their residence all year round.",
          "We only called at the cafe in the car park. It was not busy, being early in the day. It was not clear where/how we had to order food or drink, and the queue (from a worldwide background) looked confused. The young staff, though friendly, could have offered more guidance. A pity, as the food and drink was reasonably priced and ok.",
          "Nice garden. Seals tour is great. Some interesting historical facts",
          "Nice and modern looking castle with plenty of historical artifacts and antiques inside. Film on the history of the MacLeod clan is also playing in a back room. Few good spots for photos of the castle. Top floor is prohibited for public \u2026",
          "The gardens were better than the castle, and no one checked my ticket for the gardens portion. I could have paid for the castle only, and then walked around the gardens.",
          "Very pleasant morning lovely place to spend time and walk through the gardens",
          "Not worth it to be honest, we have been much nicer castles in the UK, garden was actually nicer than the castle..so you can afford to give it a miss",
          "This place was gorgeous. It was everything and more what I was waiting for. And seals in the 'backyard' was nice bonus :)",
          "The castle from outside and the sorroundings, the gardens in particular, are gorgeous. There is also the possibility to do a trip of 25 minutes by boat in the nearby loch to see the seals. I rate the outside 5 star. Unfortunately the visit \u2026",
          "Sparkling beautiful garden. If you can see only the garden, you can see free.\nCastle entrance fee is \u00a314 each adult.",
          "Excellent visit. Lots of detailed information cards in the different rooms. Stunning gardens and friendly staff .",
          "Castle is okay; gardens are gorgeous though. Well maintained, the frequent rain keeps all flowers looking beautiful.",
          "We were late to visit the castle (16:45) so only saw the gardens which we enjoyed a lot! if you have kids, make sure you see a giant marble stone in one of the gardens - it makes a lot of fun!",
          "We visited a few years ago and are going back this year. It's one of those places you fall in love with it's worth every penny of the admission charge. The castle is fantastic and so are the gardens.",
          "The gardens just keep on delivering right throughout the year - lovely",
          "Very interesting castle with friendly staff. Good value and a terrific location. The gardens are stacked with interesting plants.",
          "Steeped in history, the castle houses some interesting stories and artifacts and the gardens offer a serene walk and the opportunity to take a boat trip to see the seals that inhabit the nearby islsnds",
          "The castle is interesting as architecture and location bur the interior is totally boring. Even the famous flag is only a pathetic rag. The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. The entrance fee is 14\u00a3 for the c astle & gardens and 12\u00a3 onlyfor the gardens. For 9\u00a3 you can have a tour to a seals colony.",
          "Castle was a cool tour with lots of history. The real star here is the gardens. If your here when everything is in bloom it is quite a treat to see.",
          "Was very interesting with a lot of information in the MacCleod clan. Did not take in the gardens.",
          "Great castle and grounds. Has a friendly feel. Staff are multilingual. Seal trip was also very good.",
          "Gardens were lovely, obviously a lot of work being done there. I was disappointed with the castle interior. The staff in the castle were pleasant but none could answer my questions and I am afraid the young man in the ticket office was \u2026",
          "Very impressive and informative. Interesting history and a nice garden.",
          "Prices are a bit steep. Place was a bit of a let down as the impression is that it would be a castle. Gardensnare good, but you get to see fantastic views all around the Isle anyways",
          "History about the MacDonalds. Worthy a visit. Vistas good, watch the short video for insights.",
          "Take your time and really enjoy the gardens",
          "Interesting and gorgeous castle. Cool that it's  still in use by the current Chief. Gardens are beautiful as well.",
          "Absolutely loved it. It's definitely a \"must see\"",
          "A very cosy few rooms to go round but interesting. The grounds and garden are an example to everyone, never give up.",
          "Beautiful building within stunning surrounds, each room is wonderfully set out with the various artefacts of their time and, the short film by John McLeod was both very interesting and informative, got some great photos.",
          "Great but the rain stopped us spending more time in the gardens",
          "Marvellous view, great atmosphere and lovely interior. A must see",
          "It's just a big house. Yes, I do not call it a castle. I didn't notice any worthy areas in the house nor were the gardens worth the visit. I'm trying hard to console myself for unnecessarily increasing McCloed's family wealth by GBP 14 & \u2026",
          "An interesting piece of history, showing Skye's past. Worth an hour or two on a rainy day. Excellent coffee and food.",
          "Not the prettiest or the grandest castle but wow does it make up for this in other ways. Castle tour is so interesting. Gardens are really diverse and beautifully cared for. The greenhouse in the walled garden has a particularly well chosen \u2026",

          "Beautifully designed and maintained gardens. Lots to walk around and enjoy.",
          "Lovely castle and gardens. Castle is a bit small considering it was 14 pounds entry.",
          "Setting is beautifully. Interior a bit interesting (mostly pictures of past clan chiefs). Exterior needs allot of work. Nice garden. Too expensive.",
          "Beautiful, nicely presented historical facts. Excellent seal tour - experience of a lifetime!",
          "From the Coat side a very beautiful view! Best is to take the short boat trip to the seals which is for low money.",
          "Lovely place. Well worth a visit. Gardens are stunning and seal trip is nice alternative",
          "Beautiful castle with lovely gardens. Really helpful staff. An enjoyable walk and education",
          "Nice gardens and interesting visit to a part of the castle. However, quite expensive for being so non-spectacular.",
          "The castle and gardens are yours to explore. Learn some of the history of the Macleod clan if you want to fully appreciate the history of the place. Overall an interesting place to wander through, though the citation of the artifacts is a bit haphazard and incomplete.",
          "We have been to a lot of castles around the world and this one was disappointing. Gardens are beautiful but the castle was lacking in true historical relevance. Displays of stuff but overpriced for what we really learned and were able to \u2026",

          "Lovely place, a bit expensive but everything is well maintained and the garden is huge",
          "Didn't go inside... Too pricy... This castle got renovated twice it seems and we can clearly see that... Saw lots of seals nearby the loch in the castle... Lovely...",
          "Castle great but the boat ride to see harbour seals and even sea eagle was fab",
          "Loved it. Not as dramatic as others but still nice for an occupied castle.",
          "Beautiful and amazing location. Stayed in Keepers Cottage - amazing. Warm all equipped.  Shame it doesn't have a bath as the shower isn't great, electric and small.",

          "Loved the gardens and scenery around the castle, glad we stopped",
          "Whether it's Seal watching, beautifully landscaped gardens or a bit of history you're after this is the place.\nOr, y'know, if you got Storyteller as a kid and remember the story of the Fairy Flag then you may want to come here and see THE REAL FLAG ITSELF! I cried with happiness, I am not ashamed of that \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Good to see inside a castle that is still occupied and not just a ruin.",
          "We were very fortunate with the weather, it was a beautiful day... The castle is not the most picturesque I have seen from the outside, there are certainly more pleasing to the eye.. The history, ancient and recent is truly fascinating, and \u2026",
          "Lovely gardens what a show with the waterfalls & the castle a must to see.",

          "Beautiful castle, gardens and walk along the beach.",
          "Kids loved the garden and the key hunt in the castle kept them amused.",
          "Lucky with the weather with only brief showers and a mainly blue sky and even an appearance by the sun. We did the seal boat trip, if you like getting up close and personal it's worth it. Any camera, no zoom, you will get good pictures of \u2026",

          "A little disappointed with the interior as it's been mostly redone and doesn't really have the feel of a castle.  Beautiful grounds surrounding the castle.  We did the boat excursion to see the sea lions and was worth it.",
          "Had so much fun here especially in the gardens with the moving stone......\nCastle would be better if there were more rooms open for the visitors with displays.",

          "Lovely gardens and waterfalls, , the castle was OK but nothing spectacular.",
          "As a castle it\u2019s just average, nothing special really. There is one floor that can be visited and it\u2019s smallish, when compared to other larger castles. I think it\u2019s a bit overpriced for what it is. When you are all done, you ask yourself... \u2026",

          "Dunvegan Castle and Gardens - beautiful - spectacular - chuck loads of hyperbole at it and it'll fit - oh yeah and \"expensive\" should be in there too. Now I admit I am a grippy Yorkshireman but \u00a312 to take a stroll round the gardens was a \u2026",

          "Well kept, very informative and a large property! 2 gift shops!",
          "An interesting castle with impressive views of life when the building was manned. The adjacent gardens are the real attraction, they are divided into complexes, each of which has its own uniqueness. Worth a visit especially.",
          "Cute castle and lovely gardens overall a little on the small side to be honest it was a nice pitstop on the way to three chimneys.",
          "Not the prettiest castle in the Highlands by far and although full of wonderful ancient history, much of the remains are concreted, floorboarded and painted over leaving much to your imagination only. Gardens are large but not near as spectacular as those of Cawdor and others in the Highlands.",
          "Great historic building. Gardens are stunning.",
          "Great day out. Interesting visit to the castle and lovely garden walks.",
          "The gardens are completely worth the time! Normally I would have wanted to skip the gardens and just see the castle. The landscaping was beautiful and we got to see a lot of unique flowers, herbs, etc in the gardens. The castle was fun to see too.",
          "The Dunvegan Castle is still inhabited. Parts of the Castle are a museum about the history of the MacLeod Clan. Especially noteworthy is the botanical garden next to the Castle!",
          "Dunvegan is definitely worth visiting while in Skye. You get to step inside the longest inhabited castle in Scotland, you can wander about its beautiful gardens and even see its waterfall. Plus, there's the fairy flag inside, which supposedly has magical powers to help the clan chief in times of danger and strife!",
          "Lovely place and seals to see as well.",
          "Nice castle comes with a beautiful garden.",
          "Lovely gardens beside the loch. Didn't venture into the castle.",
          "I can't give a proper review as we couldn't visit this place. We turned up hoping to look around as it said online that it was open but when we arrived there was a sign on the ticket office saying that they are closed until April 2019. Long story short, if you're in Skye between October and April, don't waste your time.",
          "Not enough castle for the money.\n\nPaying 14 pounds to look at a part of someone's summer estate not only seems but is excessive.",
          "gardens are the real winner here. The walled + round garden especially are magnificent with some excellent rhodedendroms in both. The castle is fairly small but has some interesting exhibits.",
          "The castle is pretty cool but since it is occupied, not all of it is available to tour.  The real draw here is the gardens.  Top notch and so pleasant to stroll through, even on a rainy day.",
          "Amazing! Very beautiful castle. Don't hesitate to take the little boat to go seing the seals.",
          "Our first castle visit in Scotland didn't disappoint. Not a massive or grand scale castle, but a great way to hear highland history from the MacLeod perspective. Gardens were absolutely amazing and maybe even better than going into the castle.",
          "Not the scottish rough one, but giving a good example how the clan tried to go with times.",
          "Beautiful castle and nice gardens to walk. Also prices seem bretty fair for Scotland.",
          "Amazing place and definitely worth a visit . The drive as with any place in the highlands is amazing .",
          "Not my favorite castle experience. This one is more modern in the interior and loses the feel of a historic castle once you step in. The outside and gardens are very cool. It's a 5 star experience to walk around the castle in the outside and visit the gardens.",
          "Wonderful gardens and castle. Full of history.",
          "Beautiful place, will visit again with kids, august time.",
          "Beautiful gardens in a fine setting.  We went to see the Castle nestled against the side of the loch in a perfect spot but the gardens were a wonderful surprise.  Well worth the visit.",
          "Well worth the visit, the Castle was really interesting and gardens magnificent.",
          "I was not impressed, Castle content was not very interesting apart from the claymore sword. Gardens were dull in September and I wouldn't recommend this place.",
          "Well worth visiting.  Enjoyed the castle and gardens",
          "Hmmm... Not worth it for that money when compared with Eilean Donan",
          "Don't go when it's raining . Really not worth \u00a328 for 2 of us . Just my opinion.",
          "Great as always and awesome seal boat tour",
          "The seal trip is really cool. :)",
          "Great castle and amazing boat trip\nReally interesting inside the castle, well worth a proper look around. The gardens were not in season yet but I\u2019m sure they will be lovely in the summer. The highlight was the boat trip to see the seals - amazing!",
          "Interesting to visit.  Only downside is lack of disabled toilets.",
          "The owners did not manage to emphasize the beauty of the place... the walls are covered with concrete... such a mistake...",
          "Nice place but with some issues if you have a baby. We had our baby in a baby backpack but the staff asked us to remove the backpack and carry our baby due to the possibility of hitting the artwork. Now due to the fact we don't tend to hit \u2026",
          "Nice place to see, really enjoyed it.",
          "Entertaining visit. Most of all, staff was extremely welcoming, and took the time to tell us stories about the place. The movie in the basement was very interesting as well.  Definitely worth a visit when visiting Skye, though tickets are a bit overpriced.",
          "Sailing trip is cool ! But to be able to do it, you have to pay the garden one (not extraordinary) and the castle is 2 pounds extra so you also take the castle visit. The castle is covered with concrete ... Inside the castle is cool.\nBut \u2026",
          "Excellent gardens and grounds. Castle is nice, but quite small.",
          "Stunning place very over priced though. \u00a314 to go and see the castle and \u00a312 if you want to just walk round the garden. Try walking along the road next to the car park its a fair walk about 4 miles but an easy walk. It leads you to Coral beach it is stunning there. Very difficult to get parked as folk dump their cars all over.",
          "Interesting castle, but surprisingly limited in artifacts on show given its history. Price was also a bit steep: \u00a334 for a family ticket. I guess if the weather had been better and we'd managed to look at the gardens longer, it may have felt like slightly better value for money.",
          "Well worth a visit, stunning location, gardens great,",
          "Absolutely AMAZING!!  A must-see if you are anywhere near Dunvegan.  The MacLeod's have done a wonderful job restoring this beauty and the docent tour is excellent.  Definitely worth the time.  Hold Fast!",
          "The out of the castle may look so so, but the collection and ornaments are great! Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "The gardens are even better than the castle, which is great.",
          "Really beautiful, I love it.",
          "The woodland walks are a real treat",
          "Very cool castle tour. Especially enjoyed the family touches, paintings and artifacts, given that the clan has held the castle for so long. The location is amazing, on the water. Make sure that you get exterior views from the road past the castle parking lot.",
          "Great visit to the most historic castle on skye",
          "Gardens was the best part overall. Inside was not very impressive. Good activity to do when it is raining.",
          "Valuable!  Gardes so extraodinary! Seals tour Incredible!",
          "Nice spot.\nSooooooooo Scottish :)\nA bit expensive",
          "There are a lot of castles in Scotland, this is very old castle and I didn't waisted time to stay here being a lot of other castels in this country : Balmoral, Stirling, Edinburgh, ...are enough and a lot of places to visit on Skye isle.",
          "Beautiful views on the castle and surrounding landscape. The castle contains many interesting exhibits of history and legends. I loved the Claymore and the fairy flag. The audio video introduction however is embarrassing, appears to be at least 20 years old tape, spoken by a clan chief, who clearly isn't destined to be a TV presenter.",
          "Fabulous gardens and very interesting Clan castel",
          "Very nice castle with great views. It's a famous castle of course it is photographed a lot. Drive by and go for the gambling and enjoy other stunning views of Gardens and more. Very clean bathrooms and easily accessible parking lot",
          "The oldest existing castle in Scotland. Very interesting.",
          "Beautiful gardens, great viewpoint and nice castle museum!",
          "Always a favourite. Beautiful gardens BUT BRING MIDGE SPRAY.  Their gift shop has smidgen for 10 quid local in supermarkets it's 6 quid",
          "First time visit to this magical place.  The gardens are a must see.",
          "Fantastic gardens and property an Oasis on a desolate Isle.",
          "Just want to say that my 2 teenage step sons are the descendents of the MacLeod clan and one day I would love to find away for them to go and visit there history.",
          "Nice old castle with beautiful garden. A bit expensive, but worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful castle and gardens and interesting historical presentation but overpriced when compared with other historic properties accessible via National Trust of Scotland or Historic Scotland memberships. Doubt we would visit again even if we were nearby. That said it\u2019s a must see if you\u2019re part of Clan MacLeod.",
          "Castle smallish not very inspiring but the grounds and gardens were well worth the entry fee",
          "The castle if the MacLeod's - tastefully restored but expensive tour",
          "Gorgeous castle and gardens. Well worth a visit!",
          "An excellent Castle and Gardens.\n Well worth a visit.",
          "Great afternoon...I know it's not free but it's worth every single pound. Don't.miss the boat trip. Go for it  if the weather  is nice you can easily  spend 4to5 hrs in there.",
          "Really interesting castle, lots of information provided and beautiful gardens",
          "Beautiful castle with lovely walks around.",
          "Beautiful gardens and castle history.",
          "The gardens are really beautiful and the house is wonderfully maintained for such an old piece of architecture. It's private, so NTS membership won't get you free entry of anything, but it's well worth a visit for the historic pieces within \u2026",
          "Beautiful place kids loved it too",
          "Nice place. Entrance slightly expensive",
          "Well maintained Castle with plenty of Clan MacLeod history. The gardens are gorgeous. Entry of \u00a314 for an adult felt a bit steep but the gardens add a lot of value if you spend half a day there.",
          "Well preserved castle and gardens. Couldn't do the castle as had a dog but did do the gardens which were good but quite expensive for what they were. \nProbably much better to do the castle as well for an extra couple of pounds.\nTag the \u2026",
          "A very interesting castle. Especially the items connected with Charles Edward Stuart and Flora MacDonald. From the outside this is not a great looking castle but the gardens and the interior easily make up for the drab exterior.",
          "Quite interesting place",
          "A nice place, a real castle sometimes the owner live here. The portraits are beautiful, not too heavy. The garden was awesome. It's more a botanical garden that only a garden. So many flowers and trees beautifully enhanced. The only reason I have not put 5 stars is the price. 13\u00a3 it's a bit too much I think",
          "Magnificent well-kept Castle and Gardens. Great gift shop with brilliant items to buy as momentos of your visit. Cafe,toilets and large free car park. Well worth the visit!",
          "Tour of castle limited and disappointing. Too wet to explore gardens. Long journey to get there.",
          "Nicely lookt after. Be Shure that you are early As it can get quite busy",
          "A very nice castle with beautiful gardens. The car park is a bit small so it can be hard to find a spot. The seal boat tour was definitely worth it.",
          "The gardens were lovely and well layed out. \nThe castle was very interesting and there was plenty to view. There were guides available but I managed to see all I wanted on my own.",
          "Nice piece of history with knowledgeable guides and staff. Make sure to check out the museum on the grounds!",
          "Beautiful castle and gardens. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful grounds, and the interiors are well put together. Lots of information is provided about the history, and it's clear the family takes a lot of pride in the preservation of that history. Took one star off as the admission price is quite high, but still worth a visit if you're in the area.",
          "Castle was cool and a great way to escape the rain and wind. Unfortunately, everyone else had the same idea and it was very crowded. I haven't been to a castle before so the novelty of it was probably more exciting than the displays \u2026",
          "Loved the gardens.",
          "Spectacular gardens but certainly not a whole day out. Castle was dull.",
          "Nice place and nice staff. You can take pictures inside the castle.",
          "The Dunvegan Castle website lists a campsite called Glenbrittle Campsite, and represents it as being nearby, this however is untrue as it is a 28 mile - 54 minutes drive from the castle. Visitors beware especially when your better half is \u2026",
          "The castle is a bit boring. But the gardens are amazing",
          "What an incredible, atmospheric place. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Skye.",
          "One of the hest Castle s I have been to. The majority is open to the public with a very reasonable entree fee. Not like others that restrict you and pay heavy fees to see nothing.",
          "Not as good as other castles around for the price. The most expensive to enter but not as much on show as Cawdor for example.",
          "It's amazing how nicely the castles and gardens have been kept. All plants in the garden come with labelling. A good way to pick up some knoeledge.",
          "The main reason we come here is not for the castle, it's for the seal colony sight seeing boat ride on loch Dunvegan.  If you come at the right time of year you will also get to see young fluffy seal pups.  \nIf you're really lucky you may catch a glimpse of a killer whale patrolling out to sea.",
          "Not the prettiest of castles but the views from the castle were stunning and the gardens such a surprise! Very well tended and extensive. There was a huge variety of flowers in the walled garden. Sadly we went on a busy day so there were no \u2026",
          "A well preserved old castle with a nice ocean view here on the northern part of Isle of Skye.\n\nOne of many nice old castles and keeps that I passed by during my roadtrip, in England, Wales and Scotland back in 2001, that I took time to \u2026",
          "Great visit, full of Scottish history, beautiful gardens..",
          "Beautiful castle in a stunning seaside setting. Would highly recommend visiting. Ticket also includes entry to the lovely castle gardens.",
          "A bit pricy. There is not much to see inside the castle. Gardens are great and well maintained! For an additional fee you can take a boat trip from the pier to see sea-lions. (I think the boat trip is run by a different company)",
          "Awesome castle on the outside inside a bit empty",
          "Fantastic \ud83d\udc4c\u261d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Lively castle and pretty gardens.",
          "Have to pay quite a lot of money to see something. I don't understand why you make the culture unaffordable...",
          "The price seems a bit steep until you walk through the gardens. Then you realize it was 100% worth it. The castle and it's history are interesting on its own, but the grounds are exceptional. The round garden is a beauty, the walled garden \u2026",
          "Popular castle & gardens. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Great couple of hours spent here. Staff helpful. Great history and gardens. Recommended",
          "Great to see a piper in front of the castle. Even better is when the castle is lit up at night. Beautiful",
          "Beautifull castle. Lovely views. Car park. It is a great time killer if you go round the castle and the garden. Took my dog through the gardens then went back by ourselves to view castle itself.",
          "We enjoyed a visited to the castle and gardens. There were no guided tours of the castle the day we visited but there was information sheets in the rooms. We were there for around 2 hours.",
          "Nice castle. Interesting history of the local clan...",
          "The pl\u00e0ce is steeped in history, and the gardens are perfect. The inside is stunning as well. If your going to sky this is well worth a visit.",
          "Stunning garden's and enjoyable though smaller than I envisaged castle. Our visit was slightly marred by the large numbers visiting on a rainy Sunday making the castle too crowded to really enjoy our visit",
          "Great castle even if its raining a bit! Small but beautiful historic items and room set up :) plus that gorgeous view from the ocean ! Stunning.",
          "Visitors have access to a great many rooms in the castle, and information boards/sheets tell the vast history of this old stronghold of the MacLeods. \nThe beautiful grounds have several interconnected gardens, amongst others a walled garden and a woodland garden.",
          "This property is private so membership for National trust or English heritage does not work. Gardens are small but well maintained. Castle is very small so 20min walk is enough to be out of castle. For Asian visitors, it may not be so much attractive.",
          "Loved this day trip, gardens and castle are great",
          "Great place to visit",
          "Fascinating, beautiful and a place with a story to tell.",
          "Nice castle, but realy great gardens.",
          "Liked it interesting story there and very well presented",
          "Quite a nice garden and castle, plenty to fill a half day trip. The cafe, however,  served the most appalling food, which was also quite expensive. With such nice grounds, they are missing an opportunity to put a lovely tea room in the grounds.",
          "More updated castle with a beautiful gardens.",
          "The castle was full of history and a glimpse of the Downton Abbey life, but the stars were the gardens. Even in the rain they were magnificent.",
          "Very good gardens and views and good history in the castle",
          "Beautiful gardens and interesting castle.",
          "Amazing place, friendly people. And great seal trip",
          "Nice castle and even nicer gardens, but both are small and there's not much to do or see more than that (haven't tried the seal boat tour).",
          "Although  the castle  tour was not that long it was full of history.  The grounds were simple  gorgeous  each with it's own theme. A must see",
          "Beautiful gardens and very interesting on the inside.  Staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  Well worth the drive.",
          "Closed October 15 - April 1.",
          "Check Google for more information. I dit not get in. But the cenery outside is beautiful enough to give it a brief visit",
          "Price was quite hefty considering the castle size ect. The gardens are quite nice though. Would recommend just getting garden tickets and you can see the castle from the outside.",
          "It was a total rip off , they should be wearing masks when they sell you tickets , it's daylight robbery , it makes me ashamed to be Scottish",
          "Fantastic castle on beautiful Skye.  Gorgeous gardens.",
          "The home of the MacLeod's stunning gardens and excellent castle. Staff just couldn't be more welcoming and help full. A must if you are on Skye",
          "Nice place with beautiful gardens.",

          "Beautiful from garden and plenty history inside the castle. A must see if you are on Isle of Skye",
          "A beautiful authentic and well maintained castle with extensive gardens. The castle itself is well worth the walk through for its extensive collection of clan McLeod historical items.",
          "The castle itself, isn\u00b4t very well structured but the gardens are beautiful and the seal trip was one of the highlights of our Scotland vacation so its 5 Stars anyway! :)",
          "Cant believe clan chief Macdonald.has an English accent is he Scottish",
          "The castle is well protected from public view. The photos online seem to be well planned. The castle is underwhelming. It has some good history, but is not on par with many others open to the public at a lesser price of admission. The \u2026",
          "The outer look of the castle not so special, but go inside and the ornamental nature of the place comes into full view. History, old artworks, sculpture are just a few things you will see. There is a 16th century Gaelic claymore sword that \u2026",
          "Beautiful castle, amazing gardens.",
          "Beautiful architecture, landscape and surroundings!",
          "Highly recommend visiting this place, if you're in the area.  Very beautiful and quiet.  Do the boat tour and see some seals. The gardens are well maintained.  I'll definitely be there again.",
          "The house is interesting but the amazing gardens were the star of the show for us. Definitely worth a visit when on Skye, and easily combined with a trip to the nearby coral beach and/or Jann's Cakes!",
          "Very pretty castle. Gives you a great overview of how time passed. Tells the story of lives and s community.",
          "Not much information on history place \nNot worth the cost",

          "Insight to history and lovely gardens",
          "This was our first Castle experience and it didn't disappoint. The furnishings, the history, the displays were interesting and informative. We loved the gardens and enjoyed talking with one of the gardeners, too. (I am also a gardener). Really loved the rock waterfalls he designed. We also went on the Seal boat trip which was fun.",
          "The castle is interesting but a quick walk through and the gardens are excellent. Make sure to look out the castle windows at the bay for the seals!",
          "Great place to visit, both house and gardens",
          "Beautiful. Very friendly staff. Will visit again",
          "Not worth the time. Private castle not much to see. You are better off spending time gazing at the scenic beauty than paying for an overprived entry ticket.",

          "Castle and ground were lovely! Was amazed that you were allowed access into the castle which was really cool and the water gardens were a great sight",
          "Gardens were beautiful.  Tje sun was shining & I felt as if I was walking in a fairy tale",

          "A nice variety of things to do, lovely gardens, an interesting castle with knowledgeable guides on hand to answer any questions and the chance to go out onto the loch in a boat to see the local wildlife. If you want to do the boat trip, then head down to the booking hut as soon as you arrive because they sell out quickly.",
          "Most beautiful castle on skye island... it has a big garden with a water fall and many different plants... worth a visit if your in the area...",
          "Overpriced. Visited the gardens for 9 pounds just to walk around tags sitting next to dead or newborn plants. April may not be the best season to come, but prices could be adjusted to the service they offer. You'd think that with 9 pounds \u2026",
          "Lovely castle with very nice history",
          "Go early or very late to miss the crowds.",
          "Vastly over priced. Didn't go into the castle, but went to the gardens, very disappointed. Love going to Skye and think it's an absolutely beautiful place but won't be visiting Dunvegan Castle again",

          "Nice but expensive for little to see indoors",

          "I would describe Dunvegan as a fortified manor house.  It is an impressive structure perched on the edge of a steep hillside.  The tour was filled with intriguing family history and anecdotes that helped the building really come to life."

The pools are a vivid blue  and are a popular place for wild swimmers who brave the frigid waters.The habitat of the Fairy Pools hosts a variety of animals, such as red deer, rabbits, and sheep. The area is also host to a large number of birds. Large flocks of crows, ravens, and gulls are present in the area, as well as such smaller birds as meadow pipits, turnstones, common ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins, and curlews. The physical landscape is predominately rocky, with some boggy areas here and there. The water in the area is typically cold, as the pools are fed by mountain streams.The Fairy Pools are a popular location for walkers. It is about a 20 minute walk to the Fairy Pools from the Glen Brittle car park.\n\n\n== Internet hoax ==\nIn 2013 an internet hoax circulated suggesting the Fairy Pools had sprouted vivid purple flora.

          "Definitely one of the highlights of my trip. Getting there required paying a taxi driver to drive me up the narrow path and to wait for me after I finished looking at the location. It's such a gorgeous picturesque area to take some lovely photographs.",
          "The lovely slightly strange landscape, very unusual mounds and gullies to walk about in, loved it. however not for the unfit, was very busy, parking not easy. Overall a good place to spend and afternoon and have a picnic",
          "It\u2019s very hard to find parking and can be annoying to navigate for to people walking in the road. But the site is absolutely magical!",
          "While researching our trip to Scotland, the pictures I saw of this location were some of the most intriguing that I found on the internet. It looked pretty magical and we were determined to find it. In fact, it ended up being on the reasons that we decided to stay on the Isle",
          "This review is difficult for me. Fairy Glen itself is a truly magical place with unique landscape formations. Lots of walking and climbing and running opportunities. Five stars. However, it is truly overrun by tourists. And we went in late September! This results in",
          "Long drive to see the water falls and clear pools of water as wells a long hike not too easy for elderly or handicap that i could tell. Nice scenery, crystal clear water. See on a warmer non rainy day if you can to better enjoy the trip it takes to get to this area.",
          "Despite this being a very small area there were a surprising amount of visitors, possibly everyone hoping to get off the beaten tracks and ending up in the same place. There\u2019s actually parking for maybe 8 cars, despite the location pin on Google Maps saying 2 spots. The \u2018hike\u2019",
          "Went to explore the stunning landscape and scenery of Fairy Glen, its a magical looking place, situated near Uig. Well worth taking the trouble to go, take stout footwear so you can climb some of the small hills for the views of the surrounding conical shaped hills, its pretty",
          "It was a lovely place and a nice drive down a one track road, but to be honest..all the cairns are gone and it\u2019s just a wee fair circle \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2b55\ufe0f it\u2019s a lovely place, just not what we thought.",
          "Beautiful place, even in the rain and mud. A bit trampled by tourists, but a lovely spot and worth a visit.",
          "Had just finished raining when we arrived...so very muddy walk back to the glen. Be sure to wear good shoes as some spots are very rocky, but this is a fairly easy walk for most. Magical green hills look like they were carved by the wind. It was quite busy when we visited and",
          "I had no idea what to expect when we got close to the glen. There is very little parking as others have said. First off, we visited in September, and we were able to park along the road across from the pond below the glen. There was very few visitors. Second, wear good hiking",
          "We visited the Fairy Glen and really enjoyed it. I guess I wouldn't call it a hike but rather a quirky place to just explore. This place is full of green, rolling hills with a few strange rock formations. It's unlike any other place and it's fun to just hike around and",
          "One of the loveliest places on Skye as with all natural lanscapes its up a single track road and parking is limited. for this reason we decided to park at the spaces close to the Uig hotel then walk up the road along past the cemetry to the glen.This walk was no longer than 30",
          "A magical place to visit and a climb as far as you want to go. It can get busy and there isn\u2019t much parking. We first visited in March and there was only the two of us there. Second visit in October and busy so I would imagine very busy in the summer months.",
          "I took a tour to many of the sites on skye, this was not on my must see list but ended up being my favorite spot. Very much worth stopping here, however very popular spot.... single track road with campers and cars in every direction.",
          "Lovely, lovely place. Wasn\u2019t too busy as it was raining, very peaceful and quite magical. Not entirely sure why there\u2019s a comment saying it\u2019s too touristy and complaining there\u2019s no carpark so to build one to suit tourists...doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not there to please you,",
          "This area just has the sense of magic and legends. Beautiful scenery and would love to visit again. Would be good if they had some info boards telling some of the faerie stories. The car park (if you can call it that) is tiny and muddy, not suitable for large vehicles! We heard",
          "Perhaps if there is a really good story about the ancient history of the ring it would be more interesting. What I found the most interesting was the unique geography in the immediate area of the ring. It was also very cool that we could hike all over some private property",
          "It is a lovely area to visit. A very mystical and charming place. One hillock will give a view over the whole landscape. If you believe or not it is worth a visit.",
          "Nice views of the Glen.. mystical and almost magical.. suitable for people of all ages and can do a short hike as well..",
          "First thing in the morning after breakfast, we headed out to Fairy Glen. One lane road after the turn off and very limited parking. But since we went early, it was not a problem. Only a handful of people were there too and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. It was",
          "Very unique, an eroded geological land slip on a small scale creating lots of little conical hills, but perhaps it was the fairies, you decide. Very surreal and well worth a visit. Parking is a real issue, and during high season probably a nightmare. There is no proper car park",
          "A very cute glen to find. Loved the picturesque hike to get there. Lovely weather made the walk easy. Made you feel like believing in fairies all over again!",
          "Very tricky access on narrow road, with only about 10 safe spots to park. We went really early and it was quiet and peaceful. Lovely views and a bit of adventure. Climb up was steep and slippery, so recommend wearing trekking boots with grip. Worth the short climb, as very",
          "This was our first hike of the day and it was a good intro. Fun, cute, easy to get to hike. Use your imagination and see the fairies!",
          "Upon getting here I felt like I was in a Tolkien novel. The hiking is a bit boggy so wear some waterproof shoes as able. The views are amazing with every corner you turn.",
          "I would 100% recommend a visit if you are up near Uig - the landscape is stunning, atmospheric and unspoiled! You can spend as little or as much time as you like",

          "The area called the Fairy Glen is quite beautiful. Free to access and walk around, climb the hills and explore the area. You can climb up to the top of one hill to have a look down at the grass spiral. Area is beautiful as is most of Scotland. There is a one track road to",
          "Once more, the Isle of Skye doesn\u2019t fail to disappoint. Another long drive, to find some spoils heaps at the end of a poor road with no parking, hundred of people, all walking about at a loss as to what to do here. It\u2019s a wasted tourist attraction, with 5 to 7 waterfalls",
          "Arrived today at the Fairy Glen and soon discovered this is truly a unique place. Can be quite a steep climbs in bits but lovely views. Worth a look as well from the opposite side of the glen. We drove to a waterfall on the opposite side and worth a look from this side too.",
          "Great way to get people to walk through the lower hills and get a feel for the landscape. It is not the easiest place to find a parking spot to allow you to walk in, but it is even worse when there are bus loads!",
          "The fairy glen was a fun place to walk around to explore the hills and greenery of Scotland. It is not essy to find and the main road leading towards it is a narrow one track lane. We went in August which was heavy traffic all over isle of skye. This makes for some scary driving",
          "This is not easy to find.There is a small road just before the Uig House Hotel which does not even signpost the Glen but says strictly no coaches. Very limited parking at the site, mostly on the side of the road. A fascinating formation of mounds which are nit for the less able.",
          "Well worth a visit if you are on the Isle of Skye. To reach it you have to take a dead end lane, and there is no proper parking, just a few areas where the lane is wide enough for a vehicle. The day we visited, it was not high season, but still very busy, so in the high season",
          "Beautiful scenery. Exceeded expectations. Keep in mind you should be able to climb hills and negotiate rocks. It is for people of a moderate physical fitness level. Once you get to the top, the view is amazing, simply amazing.",
          "We had the area mainly for ourselves, only a couple of other visitors. So we could enjoy miniature Scotland very much. It's a lovely scenery. You should climb to the highest spot in the area to have a good view.",
          "Fairy Glen is a fair way from the main roads down a one lane road with passing places. It is an interesting site with a. number of small conical mounds that no one seems to know the origin of. Not a good weather day but still an interesting place to visit.",
          "We got to Fairy Glen on the bus to Uig, alighting before the church and walking a pleasant 2 mile stretch to the glen. Lots of other visitors came by car, making the road rather busy and congested at times. It\u2019s a magical spot, great views from the top. We spent several hours",
          "This is such a sweet little place that isn't like anything we've seen before. Fun to climb to the top of a small hill and see if from above - really does look just like its name! Kids would love this stop!",
          "It\u2019s really not worth it , we spent about ten mins here after getting up really early as we had read it gets really busy , the road is very narrow so don\u2019t attempt if your not good with these roads . Once you arrive it is kind of is this it ?! Defiantly been spoilt by visitors",
          "The Fairy Glen is magical. I was far more taken with it than the Fairy Pools at the other end of the island (though I recommend those, too). We saw both on rainy, overcast days, but the weather only made the Fairy Glen more mysterious. Whether you walk up from Uig or drive",
          "We were very lucky. They said 100% rain but the minute we arrived there it cleared up. We lived every minute of climbing the glen. It is a beautiful place and the ton of tourists didn\u2019t bother us at all",
          "Isle Of Skye was one of my favorite places and the Fairy Glen was stunningly beautiful! Seeing a place like this felt good for the soul and so magical!!!",
          "Welcome to the Fairy Glen and please step into the fairy land :) what a magical place! An absolute must see when visiting Isle of Skye!",
          "Very magical and stunning scenery - providing you can firstly get there along the narrow road without coming a cropper due to the amount of people, and secondly you can ignore the hundreds of other people in this \u2018secluded\u2019 place. Skye really is becoming a victim of it\u2019s own",
          "It's hard to explain this place cause i've never been to a place like it. But if there is fairy's and they are real, this is for sure where they live.",
          "This is a stunning area full of hills and hollows. One can run, walk and climb up and over the many mounds that make this a mystical place. Well worth the visit. Breathtaking.",
          "A very special bit of Isle of Skye - gentle slopes make this an easy place to walk around and see lots. The landscape is truly beautiful and magical. Like a lot of places it gets rammed with tourists and cars, so you\u2019re best visiting before 11am if you want to enjoy before it",
          "Not much of a walk, but that is okay. This spot is magical. Go for the sunset and climb up the ruined castle.",
          "We were staying about a mile away in Uig and decided to walk. It took us about 25-30 minutes to get there and same on the way back to our accommodation. it really is so much better for the whole place if you walk. There are working farms around and it's a single track road,",
          "A very fascinating and beautiful landscape. One can really imagine fairies being around. The atmosphere is mystic and inspires to a lot of stories. Worth a trip. I have never seen anything alike. There is no real parking, so at times it is a bit difficult to park the car. There",
          "The place is quite peculiar, with small green grassy hills that it is a pleasure to climb up onto. I think it's actually better under a fine rain and the atmosphere is moist, the whole area is super green and you get a marvelous senso of freshness. The kids will love it!",
          "The area itself is great to see. The fairy castle is interesting but too many visitors have created lots of paths, waste and are affecting the rural landscape.",
          "It is part of the must see on sky, but once again, don\u2019t be fool by what to see online! It is on a single track road and it can get pretty crowded, therefore keep calm and don\u2019t block the traffic line! It is worth it, I\u2019m not sure what to answer to that, but still I appreciate",
          "Fairy Glen is being ruined by thoughtless tourists, driving camper vans and cars into the glen, parking carelessly & abandoning their cars. This area is working croft land and therefore should be treated with more respect from visitors to the island. If you want to see Fairy",
          "We stayed 1 mile away from the fairy glen so walked it on our first evening here. What a great place to encounter some very different nature! I loved it exploring and climbing my wife on the other hand loved the exploring but but not the climbing bit!",
          "Lovely spot to take small children with a big imagination. Our girls (5 and 3 years old) actually saw fairies but could not visit the fairy castle because they were too big to fit in. They liked the magic circle were the spells were obviously cast though. I mean really, the is",
          "An exceptional short walk of about 2 hours over a well signposted rough track. You'll need stout shoes. Walk is rewarded with incredible views over the sea above the head of Arran. If you're lucky you may see sea otters and seals, we saw both. The Arran Trust have done a",
          "Wonderment! A small, easy walk up a mountain to receive breathtaking views in return. For those more adventurous, you can climb a little further to the top of the natural fortress. 360 views of mountains, waterfalls, lush landscape and resident sheep. Great photo opportunity in",
          "Seeing this may just make you believe in fairies. A bit of a hike to get to the glen and a climb if you want to get to the top. Well worth the effort!",
          "Definitely a great place to explore and do some light hiking and really take in the uniqueness of this spot.",
          "Worth the drive! We only spent about 30 minutes here which was perfect for us. I highly recommend climbing to the top to get the amazing views. The only thing that was a negative about this place was the road. This road is a very narrow, one lane road with two way traffic and",
          "The mounds at fairy glen are fun to hike around in. Up and down, all around. In the distance there is a large waterfall. There is a large rock that you can climb up on the right side of the road. Further back is a small waterfall and cute stream. A fairy labyrinth is nearby.",
          "Even those lacking the gifts of imagination will have their minds wander at this site. The area is small and not hard to climb to through the hillock areas. It is near Uig so amenities are nearby on a road trip.",
          "We stopped here as tourists said it was a charming little place to take a small hike and it was. It was kind of a drizzly day when we stopped but the paths and ground were not muddy. The hike had a lot of small ups and downs but nothing strenuous. Parking is on the road. Very",
          "This was an outstanding place to visit, our seven year old was so excited exploring all the paths and climbing up the rocks. Best explored on a nice day with good walking boots, and arrive early to beat the crowds.",
          "very quaint. There are many features, little moss-covered glens, odd wrinkled hills, crooked little rock formations, small ponds. You can well imagine that this is a place for fairies! Plan to spend a little time exploring and enjoying.",
          "I'm very well aware that I'm a tourist as well but the way so many other behave, and I'm not saying everyone, is ruining this enchanting place. People are running around in every possible way, destroy plants and make way for significant erosion which can already be seen in many",
          "Me and my cousin went and we didn\u2019t realise there was so much so missed out a lot. We will have to go back but I\u2019m actually looking forward to it.",
          "Definitely worth a stop. Be aware the drive up is mostly one way with passing areas. Make sure to wander around a bit away from the road to see everything.",
          "Fairy Glen is absolutely magical. It\u2019s a quick walk, not too steep, park as close to the little stone fence/fallen tree as you can, last the pond. Would highly recommend for a quick stop. Lovely place, very magical heheh.",
          "GPS doesn't work northern Scotland so it was difficult to find this place, especially since there is no signage. Its a pretty place once you're there. Note that the rings new on the far side of the outcropping of rock above the road and don't look like the picture, at least",
          "Lovely spot, great views and the weather held off! What more is there? Arrived at about 6pm, fairly quiet with half a dozen or so people around. Managed to park ok but can see if you arrived earlier in the day parking may be tricky.",
          "a very good senic walk take aproximatley 1 hour not for anyone with mobility isues very very enjoyable",
          "Very nice and easy to do walk. In total about 1,5 miles but very nice. Come early or late to avoid ths crowd. It realy gets to crowdy with a big risk the fairy glen will be ruined as people wander everywhere.",
          "But it makes for an interesting stroll. The centerpiece seems to be the ruin of a castle that has been overgrown with moss and grass. Someone referred to it as wrinkled hills and that's pretty accurate. It is tricky to drive because it's a single-track road and so you will",
          "From the very first moment you glimpse one of its round spiralling mounds, you realise it is a landscape from another world. I ignore the story of the place but it's one of the less known sightseeing spots of the Isle of Skye. It's at a stone throw from Uig and you must not miss",

          "Fairy Glen isn't far from Uig down a single track road. No real car park, cars line up along the side and you can walk along the hillside. Nice views and not a hard walk. If you do want to try going to the top of Castle Ewen, also known as the Fairy Castle, it's a little bit of",
          "The Fairy Glen is the most beautiful and atmospheric place to visit but why on earth do people need to move the stones and make circles? There are signs very clearly asking visitors not to do this. The natural features caused by volcanic activity and erosion are surely",
          "A really unique place of beauty and wonder. Difficult to find as it is not signposted (as you go up the hill on the road out of Uig (back to Portree), take a sharp left turn at a junction near to a bus stop. Really unique geographical features in a beautifully quiet but",
          "Visited this place with a friend , it was unreal Reminded me of The film , the hobbit Great place to walk , and just explore",
          "Not the easiest of places to fond on Skye, but really worth the search. We enjoyed a lovely walk over the small hills and definately recommend it. But hurry, before this becomes the next beautiful spot on the island to be over visited.",
          "This is an incredible place to visit. If there are fairies hiding in the world, they're just here. Worthwhile stop and beautiful to look at, you could easily spend an hour or two hiking around the area.It does feel like it could be a magical place. Be respectful of the fairy",
          "It really feels magical. Very original place. Just walk around and feel the special atmosphere. It's close to the road so no effort needed",
          "No car park so you park in the lay bay near the Fairy Glen. Great views. Luckily coaches are not allowed along the road that leads up to the Fairy Glen as it is just too narrow. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited the fairy glen last week and we were so thrilled at the stunning scenery. Not many people around thank fully as had read reviews about it being busy. The place is gorgeous and the children absolutely loved running through the glen. It definitely had a magically feel",
          "We took a private tour led by Billy Gray, freelance tour guide. We visited the Fairy Glen, pools, nearby castle, etc. He's very knowledgeable about Skye and Scottish history. We highly recommend booking with him and will certainly ask him for future tours! He's also an adept",
          "Remember to leave an enough energy, for the return walk, especially if you are not used to walking on rough, stony ground. Falls are lovely to see & with clear pools.",
          "This was our fourth and last stop of the day while touring Skye in our car. We hike several of the other top park destination. Once again we were lucky as the sky was blue and the visitor traffic was light. This is the very reason why we planned to visit in May. Parking was",
          "the Fairy Glen is worth going. Be aware that you can see the nice are of the Glen from the road, but the real difference is to walk up the little hills. they are not steep and not far, but you need to walk.",
          "Had planned to visit thr Fairy Pools and was not dissappointed.Even with a lack of rain there were still very pretty pools to be seen.Not suitable for wheelchairs.",
          "I could have happily sat here for hours! I truly felt as though I had been transported away to a mythical land. We had very young children with us, so didn't get to explore as much of the area as we would have liked. I was glad I was wearing my hiking shoes or my feet would have",
          "Had a good hike up the glen. Read that locales were not happy with visitors driving and parking at the side of the road so we decided to walk all the way from our hotel. Great weather and fun walk. Be careful of cars, though. Was a pretty easy walk but unexpectedly realized we",
          "Even though it\u2019s not signposted from the road this place is always busy any time of the day. Usually best parking is at end of road just before castle grate, beyond that it\u2019s private. Bit windy today but need the less enjoyable to walk around. Disappointed to see someone has",
          "Visited with my wee dogs. You can park just off the road. It is close by...it meanders as you walk the trails. It is an area of green grass everywhere...stuck to the rise and fall of the ancient ground. Great picture opportunities.",
          "It's absolutely beautiful in this area, and not something you'll commonly find. Definitely wear good shoes though as in the wetter months it can be seriously slippery, but it doesn't even matter when you get to the glen and see it in all its glory. Buses can't get up their",
          "We visited on an overcast Sunday in May and it was a fantastic location, for which the key aspect was enjoyment of the surroundings and the peace - which will never be captured in photos. Some of the other reviewers have some great pictures which do a better job than my",
          "Turn down a one lane road and about 2 miles in you can\u2019t miss it. There\u2019s a larger parking area about a 15 minute walk from the actual Castle Ewan, or side of road parking (very limited) closer to the site. We took the better parking option and walked through the hills along",
          "Our host in Fort William advised us to visit this Fairy Glen. We did no know what to expect but we were stunned at what we discovered there. Very beautiful landscape with smoothly shaped hills and sheep all over the place.",
          "Too small, the photos you see are with perspective on them, the small comic hills should entertain you for an hours or so.",
          "My wife and I stopped here as part of an organized tour. This is basically a nature trail up a series of small hills and rock formations. This is a good photo opportunity but nothing to get excited about. There is no admission fee and this activity is not recommended for people",
          "Visited on a gorgeous day in late April, lovely scenery but it's such a shame to see the evidence of selfish visitors. It's not even a busy time of year on Skye but there was still a lot of people about the Glen (not a local but visited many a time). The signs clearly state not",
          "We arrived early on a very beautiful day and parked up, then walked to the edge of a little pool by the main road. It was perfectly still and the reflection was just extraordinary - as you will hopefully agree with from the photograph. It was a really nice time of day to be",
          "One of my favorite glens on Skye! Stunning and magical. We got here for the sunrise and it was spectacular. It is really worth getting here early! Offers many walks, all easy! Gets very busy and there is not a lot of space or parking so I'd strongly recommend this at the",
          "We went in early April at 9.45 and JUST managed to find a place to park so can imagine in busy season it being crazy so suggest you park in uig somewhere and walk? Once there though it was magical and pretty and our little ones loved hunting for the fairies! We didn't do it all",
          "We visited the Glen on a wet day but despite this we loved our wee wander around this magical place.There are signs however NOT to build standing stones despite the pictures on internet show them!!",
          "Makes you feel like you\u2019re in Scotland of old. Serene, peaceful and rugged. I asked a photographer with a tripod if he was getting some good pictures. Noo , he said, I cannot decide where to point my camera. It\u2019s just so beautiful! Even our fearless 3 year old was impressed.",
          "Our time at the Fairy Glen near Uig involved quite a bit of climbing and scrambling just because we liked going the \u2018fun\u2019 ways, but it can still be enjoyed without all the climbing. You\u2019d probably still need good sturdy shoes (I had my walking boots on) and be prepared to walk",
          "We stay at Connon View in this glen two or three times every year. It is the perfect place to unwind and watch the world go by. The views are astounding and the geological construction of the little hillocks give the glen that special air of mystery. People from all over the",
          "Well worth a visit but the road is narrow and parking really is non existent - wear good sturdy footwear as tracks are soft and muddy in parts and also have a lot of rabbit and sheep droppings - the views are stunning but they must have some size of moles to build molehills like",
          "Such a beautiful experience.. tricky to find. You can easily miss it. So green and magical. Perfect place to explore.",
          "Bad road, horrible parking (as in only by the side of a one lane road) but so incredibly beautiful. I love it.",
          "We visited Fairy Glen after Quiraing since it is relatively close to its bigger, better, badder brother. First thing to know is that it is (much) smaller than expected, with a barely there parking lot along a winding, single lane road. Second thing to know is that it is open",
          "Best day of our February Holiday was coming here and doing Staffin Bay for the Dinosaur footprints. This little glen is just incredible and as a 50 year old man I now believe in fairies!\ud83d\ude04 On a February afternoon it was almost deserted and parking was easy. I can imagine it",
          "An easy walk up to the Fairy Glen, very pretty location, with lovely views. Very limited parking along the road",
          "Husband went for a freezing cold dip in the pools! Very pretty, fairly easy climb to the pools. Enjoyable visit",
          "Lovely easy and pretty Walk just a shame people ignore passing places and park in them, leave litter and move stones Recommend you park lower down and walk up if you can . Imagine it\u2019s not as nice in peak season though",
          "Amazing place! It's an easy climb to the glen (5-10 minutes). It is truly a magical and eerie place, would definitely recommend to everyone visiting Skye. There's no car park but it is possible for a few cars to park at the bottom of the glen.",
          "Bit of a climb .. no car park ..Bit of a trek to get to top.. but we'll worth it .as views spectacular .. bring good boots hat and rain coat and a packed lunch to sit and enjoy views",
          "Fairy Glen is a magical little spot and for those who are not up to a major hike, that is another bonus. It is a lot of dramatic little scenery packed into one small space. To make it even better, buses and large vans are not allowed on the single track road into the glen so the",
          "What a place! It simply feels magical and it looks amazing. I wish that we'd have spent longer just walking around and taking it all in, but there were quite a few people there so we just found a secluded spot and enjoyed the view. I saw some pictures from a friend of mine who",
          "Lovely, secluded glen not far from Uig! Not much parking available, however it isn\u2019t very well-known, so I\u2019ve never had a problem when visiting this lovely place. Short climb over a small hill from the car park, then you\u2019re greeted with an incredible array of mini hills with a",
          "I was quite glad to read RobbieMacTours that all the rocks have been removed from Fairy Glenn as they really did look quite a mess. We visited in mid September and whilst we understood the fairy circles as they seemed to belong , the zen stones were way out of place and an eye",
          "As can be seen from the photos, it's a pretty place but to protect it, something needs to be done by the local people/government. Cars were weaving off the very muddy narrow track (we saw 1 accident when 2 cars sideswiped - fortunately a minor accident)...it was a stressful",
          "I loved Skye but this place was completely underwhelming. I really have no idea what the fuss is about! I wouldn't have even thought we had arrived at a point of interest except our host recommended we visit. It was just small mounds in a field, I didn't find it enchanting or",
          "The fairy glen is like another world hence the description the scenery is splendid and eye catching. If climbing to the top of the mount be careful as the wet grass is very slippery and one of our party ended up with mud on his pants. I would recommend doing this as part of a",
          "We came here in a downpour, and it was still a great place to visit. One caution was that with significant rain, the river becomes impassable meaning you only can see a small portion of it. The person collecting money for parking did not tell us this, so we did not get the",
          "Its such a unique and amazing place - can almost make you believe in fairies! The road inside the glen gets pretty congested though, and it is a single track. But it is worth the trip!",
          "It took me 2 days to find it its not marked. It is intriquing and mystical and lovely I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted as it was starting o get dark but it should be seen",
          "There are no signs directing people to this attraction! If you are heading north on the A87 (coming from Portree), turn right on the road just before the UIG Hotel. It's a 5 minute drive along a narrow lane. Park on the grass along the roadside and don't block traffic.",
          "It was quite a drive to fairy glen, and we found the quirky landscape underwhelming. Admittedly, it was raining, & the ground slippery; but I think there are more worthwhile attractions in Skye",
          "The rock piles at Fairy Glen have been removed by locals and the area restored to its' natural state! So glad to see the monstrosity removed. These artificial rock piles were not 'magical'.....they were made by visitors physically moving and removing natural rocks and stacking",
          "We left our hotel in Portree at 8 am to try to get to Fairy Glen by 8:30 because we heard the parking was difficult. We found a really small area to park and we were the first car there. It is by a small lake on one of the many 1 lane roads at Isle of Skye. We actually missed",
          "This attraction was rather difficult to find as there weren't any signposts to direct drivers. Once there we didn't know where to go. Again no sign posts or directions. We just followed the other visitors who were blindly tramping over the hills. I got the sense that the fairy",
          "We visited the Fairy Glen mid September, locally named hobbit land! It\u2019s a lovely little place, good for a nice easy walk, once you have climbed the hills the views are breathtaking.",
          "An amazing range of hillocks; obviously left by fairies. Good for a short stroll with a nice pool at the end.",
          "This is a very unique place where the earth has been shaped in to mounds and grown over. Take some time and energy to climb the high rocks for great views. The ground can be muddy and slippery so take your time and be careful.",
          "We went to visit the Fairy Glen today and were left a bit disappointed and frankly a little upset. The site has been worn away by the masses of cairns that various tourists have built, rotting the grass beneath it. There were actually a group of friendly locals there today who",
          "20+ locals have spent the afternoon removing all the pillars, stone spirals, and fairy tokens fromthis site to return it to its natrual beauty. The good side of it, is that we have collected over \u00a380 in coins, which will be going to a local charity, that is nothing to do with",
          "So tourists throughout the world are told. However when it comes to the Fairy Glen on the Isle of Skye, tourists seem to think it is fine to build rock mounds \"for the fairies\". It is just pure vandalism, rock mounds are so high they are a danger to the local grazing animals,",
          "The fairy Glen is a unique place, a natural configuration of green hillocks that reminds one of The Hobbit. It is a place to be taken in quietly, in order to appreciate its beauty and respect the people who live here and own the land. Unfortunately, as of late, tourists have",
          "I love isle of Skye but as everyone is aware, it is hard to avoid the Scottish rain and some locations / landmarks in Skye are not quite visible when it rains or gets foggy. I find that fairy glen is ok even when it rained cos it is safe to walk around without much of a climb so",
          "This is such a magical place. I will forever cherish the time I spent here. No words can express the love I have in my heart or the connection to this land that I felt while visiting there.",
          "I was not sure what this was all about until I visited. It is hard to explain. Just imagine lots of faeries and hobbits living somewhere and then abandoning it.",
          "Located down a narrow unmarked country lane the Fairy Glen is a must see on a sunny day. The parking is tricky during high season and be warned paths can get muddy in the rain.",
          "Such a beautiful place, easy to stroll around. It\u2019s amazing how this little oasis of beauty is hidden. Love it. We went very early to beat the crowds.",
          "The whole area feels very magical and dreamy. There are many small hills on which you can climb and enjoy the scenery around you. There is plenty of people though (as there is a road right to it) so if you want to take some nice photos, I recommend visiting this place early in",
          "Totally stunning place but ruined by visitors (yes i know I was one of them). Surrounded by people who have abandoned cars and have no respect for anyone else",
          "As a tourist, it feels wrong to complain about the presence of other tourists, but for this walk my experience was probably slightly muddled by the sheer number of people stomping around the glen. Talking with others who have visited, you can probably go early or late in the day",
          "Not signposted but easily found off a road not far from Uig Hotel. Plenty of parking at the glen and an amazing place for children to play and climb happily. Some hair raising rocks to go up. Beautiful views of waterfalls. So lovely!",
          "Truly amazing place. Absolutely beautiful glen in a fantastic location on Isle of Skye. Park your car. A 5-10 minutes walk to get to the Fairy Glen.",
          "Definitely worth visiting, this site was one of the highlights of our visit to the Isle of Skye. Parking was tight next to the site - we were lucky that a car drove out of the limited parking area just as we approached.",
          "This is a very interesting geological area, however if you are not interested in geology may not be of much interest. There are cool hill with distinct ridges all along the side. I wish there was a sign about the geology of the place as well as to ask people not to move rocks",
          "The legend has it that Fairies used to live here, after visiting this wonderful, magical place I am inclined to believe it! Gently sloping hills, covered with soft grass, it is really a must see if you're in Skye! Not easy to be found as there are no signals indicating \"Fairy",
          "What an amazing part for the world. A short trip to the Ferry Glen is definitely worth it. The nature is stunning and something very special. It was already high season, however not many people. Perfect place to sit down for a picnic and enjoy the view and nature. To see the",
          "Please read : In recent years\u2019 visitors have started to move the rocks to create spirals on the ground. We have been told that some of the bus tour guides have made up and encouraged some rituals involving walking the spirals then leaving a coin or token in the centre as an",
          "This is a beautiful place to wander. It is the prototypical Skye topography and lush green vegetation. You could spend a little or a lot of time here depending on what you are after. We found there were interesting vistas in many directions.",
          "Like walking in an extended Tellytubby land. Great fun for kids to run up and down paths, hills and near waterfalls. The parking is a bit hit and miss - roadside, lay-bys or a couple of pull off areas. Allow a couple of hours.",
          "I don\u2019t get it, driving along a really narrow track to then find cars parked all over the place just to see some small hillocks? Maybe my imagination is a bit past it lol",
          "We managed to find the fairy glen relatively easily but found the final descent into it \u201cinteresting\u201d as we met many tourists driving up the hill who seemed unable to reverse meaning we had to reverse all the way back up the hill and through cattle grid. It\u2019s not for the faint",
          "We walked it here from our hostel quite late one evening and we were very unaware we had found it until it was clear we were very much in the middle of it. You just started to see lots of pointy shaped mounds with wavy lines of foliage on them and you're tricked into thinking",
          "An absolute must see!! Parking is a trick at best. So if possible walk in from Uig. If unable to walk in please don\u2019t park in the passing places. There is a worn bit that has some \u201cparking\u201d but it\u2019s not recommended.",
          "I am surprised that somewhere as enchanting as Fairy Glen is not marketed more by the Tourist Board. After a 10 minute drive along a single lane path, you come across this lush green area which could be straight out of a children\u2019s movie. The other visitors seemed equally",
          "The scenery is so unique. Ridges of ferns lining the hillside. You can almost see the fairy\u2019s flitting around in the greenery. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "This was one of my favorite things we saw in Isle of Skye. It was July, so it was busy. And it was rainy but more like a misty rain. We took our 6 year old daughter and she loved it. There were sheep grazing all around the Glen and it just added to the experience of the Scottish",
          "This is well worth the trip! We scampered up and down the hills, got yelled at by the sheep and found it to be lovely. It's totally out of the way, and luckily I found the directions posted on a shop door in Uig - otherwise I wouldn't have known where it was. A great spot to",
          "Very tranquil and relaxing little place with beautiful views. Could imagine it to be rather magical for younger children!",
          "A beautiful contrast to the dramatic landscapes all around: delicate ferns, surreal conical hills and beautiful pools. An easy meander and well worth the short diversion.",
          "Magical atmosphere in the morning when there is not too many people. The car park is extremely small so I recommend you go before 9.00am",
          "Nice place to visit, really a fairytale landscape Expect a lot of visitors... that breaks the atmosphere, especially when the drones make their noise",
          "Awesome views of the valley and waterfalls atop rock formations. The climbing is uneven and can be muddy, so watch your step, but it is worth the effort to see that part of Skye from so high up. Access is via a single track road (I hope you have a smaller car) that is a bit",
          "There is a series of these hills, if you stop at the first then you miss out on lovely waterfalls you can walk up to at least two. Climb onto rocks for lovely views. Yes, all of Skye is lovely as are the highlands and Scotland generally but after living here a year my daughters",
          "We went with our 4 and 7 year old and we all really enjoyed it. Fairy Glen is absolutely magical! The hike was fairly easy and we all enjoyed exploring the different hills. This is a must if you are in the area! Hint: Park when you hit the second set of cars along the side of",
          "One of the most magical places I\u2019ve been. The isle of Skye is pure magic! I highly recommend! Make sure you hike around the cones!",
          "Go...period. Bring with you a personal item and travel the fairy circle whilst making a wish. Go any and everywhere in Scotland - you will not be disappointed.",
          "Whilst this place has no real evidence of the fairies when you drive down to the Fairy Glen you can\u2019t help but get caught in the magic of the place. The cone shapes are quite something all together and even on an overcast day make you smile. The tower at the top was too much",
          "I found the Fairy Glen to be curious but underwhelming after the other stops we made on Skye. It's lacking the hulking jagged cliffs and impressive landscapes, but the weird, conical bumps that make up the fairy glen are certainly different. There are some interesting rock",
          "We had so much fun exploring the Fairy Glen and playing hide and seek. Our children, aged 5 & 7 loved it! A great place to run around - and very magical. Not too busy either.",
          "Went here at 9am. Pretty quiet. Was really nice. Some of it was a bit artificial but all in all good fun. Was getting VERY busy at 10am.",
          "Like many things on Skye, getting there is a challenge and parking is as well. While there were quite a few people there, it is too small for the tour buses to get there! Beautiful scenery. Great place for a picnic.",
          "This area is beautiful. Try the hike to the top of the castle. Very narrow trail and steep steps at the top but worth it.",
          "Never seen anything like this place, just stunning & very weird (in a good way). Everyone has to visit here at least once, thoroughly recommended.",
          "Just an amazing hike!! Great town to stop an eat as well. Love Scotland! A must see. It overlooks the water.",
          "This is a beautiful part of Skye and really is something to see. You can spend as long as you want here exploring and climbing all the little hills or even having a picnic. Suitable for all ages but I would imagine a very special place for children to visit. Behind the loch, you",
          "A nice place to go for a walk, resembling 'the shire' from the Lord of the Rings films. Great opportunity for some nice photographs here. Parking isn't great, but you will eventually find a space.",
          "Beautiful scene as you drive round the corner. Great walk and climb. Beautiful scenery. Would recommend. Park on the roadside and there is a path to the side for the walk. You can walk freely around.",
          "While the Fairy Glen was fun to explore, it was not easily found and quite frankly, we still never saw the stone circles after exploring for quite a bit. It was fun to hike round the little hills and the views were really great. I am sure that had we been on a tour, we would",
          "Try to get here early before 9am or close to sunset, definitely worthwhile, but best to see when no one else is around, truly an unusual place to walk in and see, beautiful scenery.",
          "Nice views, with a easy and short hike to the viewpoints. Parked by the roadside. Absolutely worth going.",
          "You will feel magic here, its a nice place to visit. You will feel like Harry Potter here for a moment ;) view from here is awesome.",
          "There is no sign on the road, just got the recommendation from the information center. It is an amazing place to explore.",
          "Skye is too popular! Even late on an evening, taking advantage of the long days, the Fairy Glen was quite populated. Still, it was worth the single track drive. Very curious looking place! A great spot for a walk.",
          "This is an interesting site, but it was so overrun with people that it was hard to imagine as a magical place. Still, if you can walk up there from the nearby hotel or get a parking space, it\u2019s worth seeing.",
          "We were told about the fairy glens during our stay in Uig, so decided it was something we had to do. After a lovely meal at Uig hotel, a member of staff gave us directions to the glen. It really is a beautiful area to have a wander about. Well worth a visit.",
          "The fairy glen is the one place on earth you will feel magic and do me a favor, no matter what the tour guide says, stay out of the stones and feel free to leave an offering for the fairies to gain favor",
          "Quite a surreal and lovely landscape - the kids loved running around and we had a fabulous couple of hours.",
          "We came here on an Outlander tour. We were here in mid-May. It's interesting to walk around and photograph. There weren't a huge number of people around when we came and the ground wasn't muddy, so we enjoyed our time here.",
          "Rippling hills, stone circles and a \"fort\". Very unique topography and some wonderful views from the top of the glen.",
          "Didn't know what to expect but we were blown away by the views, beauty and experience. It only takes an hour and when done in conjunction w/other stops is was a great visit.",
          "My friend and I went in May and thankfully, it wasn't so crowded. Also, we were grateful that the sun came out that day too. We hiked up the mounds and on the other side saw stone circles created by tourists. There were sheep walking around. One can probably spend 1-2 hours",
          "Really sad to say we've had our final visit to the Fairy Glen. At least during the non-winter months. I've been visiting this place for the better part of 20 years - it is utterly amazing with its little conical hills and pretty vistas. But it has changed over the years. At our",
          "Plenty of space to park near road if you visit later on in the day. Beautiful place, with plenty of small hills to take in views. I would have loved to see a information board to tell you more about the place.",
          "Even thought he weather was typically Scottish drizzle this is a magical place- lots of strange hillocks to climb, hide round and just thoroughly enjoy. No-one else there- spent ages with the dog who was just as enchanted as I!",
          "The Fairy Pools are in an amazing location with the Black Cuillins as an amzing back drop, bit of a walk in bit well worth it",
          "We got here by bus, which dropped us off well over a mile away, just south of Uig. The hike was mostly along a road, but we had to frequently step off to let cars pass. That said, it was worth the hike. The place has a magical quality about it, and not just from the stones place",
          "This is the place to add to your list of things to see if you have kids. I had fun running around looking to see what was around the next corner.",
          "Visited in the evening, only ones there. Really amazing landscape with rocky outcrops sticking up in weird shapes and patterns. Instagram does not do this place justice. Best thing we did on Skye!",
          "Hidden away inland from Uig port. Take a sharp turn on left into narrow road as you go uphill just past the Uig Hotel. Follow the road to the very end, ignoring possible parking places on the way. By doing so, one, you will drive through the Faerie Glen and two, potentially you",
          "This is a must visit site. Gorgeous cone shaped hills. While it was rainy during our visit, it didn't detract from the beauty. Do not skip this hidden gem.",
          "It is a magic place! You feel like you are part of a Celtic myth. The way those hills are gathering around the fairy magic circle... The parking lot is very small, so many people park the car on the road. It\u2019s a half an hour easy hike",
          "This place is worth a stop. The landscape and views are beautiful. It isn\u2019t much of a hike unlike some of the places located on Skye. The only problem I see is the parking. If there are a lot of tourists it would be very hard to find a spot.",
          "We were recommended by our hotel to visit this as we stayed in UIG. We are glad we came here. This place is really nice and we have no regrets coming. Truly worth the visit. Do come here is you are at UIG .",
          "Very cute little magical place to stop and wander around. It was a little muddy when we were there so be careful with foot placement when you are walking about. Comfortable shoes would be useful. Once you get past the little trees the views are amazing as are the cairns.",
          "Small car park great geological phenomenon beautiful landscape on walk up to see the rocks. Worth the walk . No info boards of explanation which would have been helpful.",
          "This is a lightly visited and easily accessed on Skye. A short walk brings you to an overlook of a central rock ring and multiple cairns (ferries). The surroundings ar enchanting, and easily visited with children. A definite Go To spot...",
          "One of the coolest things we did in Scotland. It\u2019s absolutely breathtaking and a great place to explore. We were able to easily hike all around to take in some of the most incredible sights. Don\u2019t miss this!",
          "We got there at around 9am and had the whole area to ourselves.This made the walk and stunning scenery absolutely magical. A MUST if on Skye.",
          "Really Beautiful. We visited in August and again had problems with parking. Getting the Fairy Glen was a little nerve wracking as it is a single lane road and we kept having to back up for thousands of feet to let traffic through and vise versa. We almost turned around. Once we",
          "went up when the weather was not the rest but it's Scotland what do we expect! love the isle of skye and made the most of it this time.lovely little spot to visit",
          "On the strength of a few review recommendations we waited until later in the afternoon before visiting the Fairy Glen. We weren't disappointed as we not only found a place to park the car but there were also relatively few people around as well. There scenery is quite special",
          "Very easy to spend some time here. Several easy hikes in the area. Highly recommended if in the area.",
          "You can drive up to the area via the road by the Uig Hotel, but it's an easy enough half hour walk too, with only the first half steep. There's no question the small conical hills are strange and interesting, but I can see it generally appealing to either small kids or to people",
          "We visited around midday and it was heaving with people. Parking is limited so meant parking at the roadside. The sun was out so the scenery was absolutely stunning. A fair walk to the fairy pools which are a pretty natural feature. Worthwhile activity which lasts around a",
          "Beautiful place! Agree with other reviewers that it is best done early or late in the day to avoid crowds. Definitely worth stopping by!!",
          "Visit this place early or late on the day. People spoil it. It is just such a magical place and you can imagine fairies wondering here when everyone has gone.",
          "This natural wonder of hills, stones, rocks is truly amazing and a must see if on the west coast of Skye. I believe this is Sven more stunning in summer when colours have changed into more green. When we visited there were plenty of ravens and eagles as well.",
          "We had the incredible good fortune of visiting Fairy Glen on a sunny, warm day in the summer, and everyone in the family agreed that it was a truly magical place. The emerald green hills were enchanting and easy to explore and the views from the tops of the of the pointy",
          "The landscape of the fairy glen is unusual and gives you the feeling that fairy tales might just come to life. We visited as a family with a 5 and nearly 3 year old. They managed the walking quite well although we kept our youngest back from climbing Castle McEwen. There are a",
          "I found the area really interesting, you can see how the belief in fairies was founded when visiting places like this.",
          "Very busy on Easter Day, Fairy Glen had an unusual appearance. Well worth a visit. Might be a good setting for a play about witches, rather than fairies. Strange looking hills and gnarled trees.",
          "We loved this stop in our drive around Skye. Park anywhere along the road you can find and hike up the rugged Glen to get a full view of the area. Beautiful bright pink trees this time of year and glimpses of farm in the distance and remnants of stone shelters from distant past.",
          "We came here in the afternoon as we were traveling around the peninsula . Having already hike the Old Man if Storr, we were not up for another big hike. Well we were in luck. This is a very quick and easy hike and it is a cool spot . We had some trouble finding it because there",
          "I was dragged along by my partner to a \u2018Fairy Glen\u2019 . . . don\u2019t get me wrong, it was a nice day ( but it had been raining [understatement of the year !!] for a few days before we got there, but on the day the sun was shining ! my partner got out for a look, and I parked the car",
          "We actually drove passed this place and ended up at a farm and a dead end. It isn't sign posted and quite frankly have walked in far better places. I have wanted to visit Skye for so many years and found it to be very disappointing. If the weather is bad, as it was for us,",
          "There is parking nearby and you can walk by the river coming down the slope. When we went, it was very busy and there were countless number of people - ready to have a dip in the cold, yet crystal clear waters. Must visit when in Isle of Skye.",
          "Lovely place to visit. Very interesting formations. We were there when everything was iced over, so perhaps the fairies were taking a day off. Difficult to blame them. Brrrrrrrr.",
          "Such strange formations wherever you look. A really strange place. Stone circles and a peak to climb that gives great views over the entire Glen. We also built ourselves a little cairn. Hope it's still there when we go back!",
          "I know this isn't some ancient fairy playground but it sure felt like it! Had an incredible amount of fun finding my way through the glen with my daughter. Beautiful location for photography or artists and fun for kids!",
          "very nice and beautiful place. offers nice views all around and a little adventure to get to the top of a rock",
          "This place was sweet although I\u2019d save it for warmer months with a little less blowing wind and rain if possible...it\u2019s also challenging to find...it gets VERY VERY WET and we saw several people in wellies and sneakers fall and slip down the steep slopes covered in mud. Wear",
          "This is an amazing place to visit and if your anywhere nearby you should locate and stop for a visit. Very pretty. The landscape changes dramatically as you enter this hilly fairy glen. Seems almost mystical. Watch your step walking about and don't wear red. The fairies don't",
          "We stopped at the Fairy Glen on our way to Uig to catch the ferry to Lewis and Harris. It\u2019s so quaint and beautiful, and such a unique experience. Try to get their on the early side to enjoy some peaceful time with the faeries before lots of people arrive.",
          "Had no idea where this place was as it's not signposted. There's not really anywhere to park. It's a beautiful area, nice wee walk, saw loads of dragonflies! Spoilt by people building stone towers!",
          "Almost magical landscape most deserving of its name. Worth scrambling around but be careful it can be very slippery. It's a pity that the lane goes through it. Would be great if it were traffic free with appropriate parking on the fringes.",
          "Not the easiest to find, the fairy glen is reachable from a side road near the Uig Hotel. There is no formal parking area, but we found some space by the side of the road where other cars had also parked. Like the Quirang, the Fairy Glen was formed by landslides but some of the",
          "Be sure to come prepared with waterproof walking shoes and you'll be amazed by the incredibly beautiful hills. After a tricky, single track drive you'll come upon this dramatic glen. Be sure to park off the road to avoid driving difficulties. Take time to walk up and down the",
          "This is an amazing place to visit. The landscape changes dramatically as you enter this fairy glen. Seems almost mystical. Make sure you climb up the landscape on both sides of the road. Beautiful location just 30 minutes walk outside Uig. Be careful if the ground is wet as the",
          "I could have spent the entire day climbing the hills and looking at the fantastic landscape. It was sunny for September, and the midgies were gone, so how much more perfect could it be?",
          "One cautionary note is: beware of the single track road! That said, this is a very worthwhile side trip. My wife was the one who wanted to visit the site and I was lukewarm until I saw the incredible landscape. We wandered around for over an hour enchanted by the views.",
          "Quite easy to find just off the main road into Uig. As usual it\u2019s a single track road up to and through the glen with very few parking spots. On our visit it had been raining so it was very slippery everywhere. Don\u2019t do what some idiots do and park in the passing places.",
          "Worth a short visit as an interesting landscape. Take boots as can be quite muddy. Single-track road to get there and limited parking.",
          "I was so disappointed that we couldn't find a place to park and get down. It was raining as well so I only managed to take some photos from the car. If we had the time we would have returned but we didn't. So my advice would be to park further away like a few metres away and",
          "This is one of my favorite spots in the world! It's so quiet, peaceful, and the beauty compares to none. You really feel like you're stepping into a land of fairies and expect to see one dancing. It's hilly and requires some hiking, but it's worth it. If you're not careful",
          "Initially we drove through the Fairy Glen looking for somewhere to park, and it's beautiful just to drive through. Yes it's along a narrow single track road, but Skye is full of them. Just drive carefully and considerately and it's fine. Unfortunately people were parking in",
          "This is different from most hikes. It really is just a ramble through a beautiful glen, that's got a few charming \"fairy rings\". As usual for Skye, totally inadequate parking. But at least no tourist buses - the road is so narrow, they can't get there! Feels like rambling",
          "We went there, and i am glad. It just what you imagine place where fairy live. Doesnt take long, very little place but just beautiful. There isn't car parking, but you just par your car of the road. Sometimes it can be crowded.",
          "I have had a photo of this place I was going to paint for over a year. Finally I had a chance to visit in person. It is a magical experience. Such a beautiful but hard place to find. I was not able to climb to the top by made it 3/4 of the way up. There are so many photo",
          "Parking for this natural attraction is not easy. You may be lucky to get in to the small car park or you may park on the road where the signs clearly ask you not to! Most people do. The walk the the fairy pools takes about 45 minutes and is not suitable if you are unable to",
          "Feels like you're walking through a Disney movie set. Make sure to stop here. Highly recommend Uig Hotel for lunch or dinner as well.",
          "I would not have specifically come here to see this but I am glad I have seen them. They are different. With a bit of imagination they are magical. They have their own beauty. If I had children with me they could be the base of many bedtime stories.",
          "Very difficult to find as it is not marked. You have to \"know\" or ask someone. We worried we were not on the right track as we felt like we were entering someones hidden driveway when we started up the narrow, one-track road, but plenty of folks found the glen and I suspect they",
          "Great place to visit for all ages, can park very close by but can be busy. I would recommend proper walking shoes as can be muddy. Fun walks to look at waterfalls, circles and look out points, highly recommend, such a pretty area.",
          "Having visited and stayed in Skye so many times we have lost count but we had never visited the Fairy Glen, an amazing place of conical hills one of which still has a basalt top still intact which from a distance makes it look like a ruin and has been called Castle Ewan which",
          "This was my second time visiting, and I would definitely go back again. The road in was a bit terrifying for someone not used to single track roads, thankfully I had a tiny VW Polo and could squeeze between the other cars and not fall off the side of the pavement. The glen is",
          "Strange grassy mounds, random rock structures, all in a petite little collection, just off the road from Uig. No fixed paths - you can wander wherever you like! Getting to the top of Castle Ewen, the strange rock ridge, requires an awkward scrambling step up & down. Be aware",
          "If you want a little magic in your life, you need to check this spot out. Please note that it is a slightly arduous clamber up the hill especially if it has been raining out. The terrain can be slippery, but the climb is worth it. Once you get up around the corner you spot",
          "We had moved on from our failed attempt at Quiraing and were again confronted with a narrow road and muddy, low verges. At one stage there was 4 cars heading in the opposite direction to a one of those mini tour vans and insistent that all 4 cars reverse to let him through... a",
          "There are no words that can quite describe this place accurately - it is almost like you've stepped into a movie or a different time. The green is so green, the air smells fresher than any air I've ever smelled and you could truly believe that fairies are living here. The",
          "At the second time of looking we eventually found this hidden gem in Skye. It wasn't quite what I had expected but still had a magical quality which made the trip worthwhile. Unfortunately, the beauty is marred by the fact that the place is heaving with visitors and cars are",
          "It rained, stopped and began to rain while here, but the beauty was stunning. It was even worth the drive on the crazy single track road.",
          "Some special rock formations and dirt erosion made these circular mounds (I have forgotten already the geological particulars, only that these are very unusual and not to be found anywhere else in Scotland) and they are tall. Great views, but beware the small (narrow) paths",
          "I had read about this prior to us visiting and asked some locals where it was and how to get there; most of them had never heard of it! Done did say that when we saw it, we would know! And they were right! When driving along, we saw the little hills and dales, they just look",
          "The views are beautiful, bring along your swimming suits if you want to go for a dip. But do wear proper attire for trekking at times it rains and is very slippery.",
          "Fairy Glen It is a unique beauty full of little hills nature made, haven't seen anything like it.It's a small Glen (lots of mountains and small valley in the middle)But for fairys so It will be small to humans but it's quite lovely all green and a small lake in the middle we had",
          "This place is awesome. Make sure you explore all around the hills and go right to the top. It had been raining so pretty muddy but worth getting a bit dirty. Really pretty and amazing.",
          "We visited Fairy Glen not knowing what to expect. In hindsight that was the best approach! We asked some of the locals what was at Fairy Glen and they didn't tell us as they didn't 'want to spoil it' for us. The parking is awkward and in bad weather, I'd recommend not",
          "Firstly, when I heard the name I thought it was something about ferrys (boats). I was gladly mistaken. The forest area is quite mucky but if you believe in fairies then you'll like this place.",
          "This was not a good experience. A narrow little road full of cars parked everywhere with impatient drivers. The sides of the road are covered in mud, there is nowhere to park or turn your car safely, if you pull off the road you risk damage to your car. Castle Ewen is not a",
          "I didn't get it....perhaps I didn't walk far enough?! I went at 7pm so parking then was very easy. Very quiet. I spent 10 minutes walking around but didn't see anything interesting",
          "Basically a nice walk along a scenic stream, but prepare to share the walk - and the path - with a few hundred fellow tourists. If you manage to make it beyond the official \"point of return\", though, you stand a greater chance of eating your sandwich in something resembling",
          "Really an enchanted place. Beautiful in every way. It can be very muddy and slippery in some places. Unfortunately (like some more places on the Isle of Skye) very busy. Parking your car is a challenge (some people park on passing places...don't make that mistake, is really an",
          "One of our top two hikes/walks on our trip, this absolutely charming little glen is somewhat off the road around the western end of the Trotternish peninsula, just south of Uig. Driving into it from the barren hills you are shocked to see the softly rounded little mounds,",
          "We loved the Fairy Glen, but I understand the complaints about \"nothing to see\" and the parking. We have two teens who are not crazy about long, boring hikes, even with great scenery. This was a perfect, absolutely beautiful place for all of us climb and explore for an hour.",
          "The Fairy Glen, Isle of Skye - near Uig, is well worth the effort to find. Our visit was on a day of mixed weather, mostly showers with short breaks of less wet weather. The weather added to the effect of this magical place. How to get there?? Once on the Isle of Skye, drive",
          "We spend much more time here than we had planned. There was so much to explore. We went with our 6 year old daughter and it was amazing! The land is owned by a local farmer ( I am pretty sure) and it is breathtaking. There are tons of little hills to climb to get spectacular",
          "Let's be honest, this is an odd landscape of humps and bumps and nothing more. The drive isn't worth it, there's better places to go and things to see. If you decide to go and see it anyway don't rush to park in the first little carpark area you see, there's more space further",
          "Wasn't to busy when we arrived and stayed relatively quiet whilst there, worth walking all of the way through and over the top for some really good views.",
          "I'm going to go against the popular vote here and say this was the most overrated thing I've seen in a long while, maybe ever. There are so many fabulous views to see in Skye and so little time to see them, some little green cone shaped hills just don't do it for me. In fact,",
          "Magical experience. Not hard to imagine fairies roaming the hills. Found a lovely place to sit under a tree amongst moss covered boulders, shielded from the rain. Could see a beautiful waterfall off in the distance. Experience was partially marred by a posh farmer in a shiny",
          "The Fairy Glen is a rural landscape. Similar to the rest of the landscape on Skye. However, when we went to visit there was no parking available. The driveway where people used to park is now marked with a \"No Parking\" sign. There are passing places which people are incorrectly",
          "This was a great place to have a walk and a picnic. The view from the fairy castle is terrific. Watch out for sheep poop! They frolic all about the fairy glen and leave presents.",
          "Hands down my new #1 favorite place in Scotland. Just magical. Loads of cairns made by the \"fairy folk,\" sherries on the hills all around, and the tower like rock made it feel like something out of Lord of the Rings. There IS a feeling one gets there...almost as if the",
          "A truly magical spot to visit. You can really let your imagination run wild here. Easily accessible when you arrive and you could easily spend hours there. Unfortunately it's not very well signposted as you come through Uig, and with no cellphone reception it made navigation",
          "What a lovely place to visit. The landscape is very unusual and can be appreciated from either a purely artistic perspective or with a little research from a more geographical. Visit late or early to avoid the crowds and park before the lake for a slightly longer walk.",
          "this place is magical. it is tinier than it looks in pictures, but it is just darling. the hills around it are all little pyramids with these beautiful ripples in them. there are waterfalls across the way. the views are just gorgeous. this was my favorite place on skye.",
          "Unfortunately it is getting too well known and was pretty crowded with people. I was shocked to see a tour bus out there considering the narrow road in and out. It was magical and glad we went even though it was drizzling when we arrived. I've seen nothing like it anywhere",
          "The Faerie Glen is such a magical place - for old and young alike. The landscape is so unique with peaks and hills and ripples along the greenery. Definitely a must see in Skye as there isn't something else like it! It's a little hard to find, but worth the extra effort,",
          "It is a must on your journey of the Fairy! Picturesque and a magical place full of hills and dales! You ust be very careful on some of the hike but is worth the trip and on a beautiful day it was a fanciful place!",
          "We enjoyed our time at the Faerie Glen during a day trip through sky. The greenery, the rock formations and hills make for a magical setting. Since we went with a tour guide, we didn't have to park ourselves, so I can't attest to ease of parking. However, I can say there",
          "A walk through the faerie glen opens up a world of imagination particularly for families with younger children. You can almost feel the fay experience as you explore this little paradise.",
          "Amazing geological formations in this glen. Easy to see why it inspired filming of Big Friendly Giant. A must see in Skye. Not east to find turnoff though - follow signpost for Balnaknock about 1 mile south of Uig.",
          "Yes it's a bunch of mounds clustered in an area that is quite scenic. However if you let your imagine run just a little bit, you could see hobbits, and other characters from the Lord of the Rings around you. It's just a magical little piece of the earth that makes you want to",
          "This area is near Uig and can be tricky to find but it's worth searching for! Our kids loved hiking to the top of one of the columns, and checking out the little caves. Must see!",
          "The Fairy Glen is a nice place to visit. If one would say that dwarfs, elves and alikes would live here, you would believe it. Charming place, not big, not crowdy, but totally relaxing.",
          "This was the highlight of our time on the Isle of Skye. A must do - wish we had had a little more time to spend there.",
          "This is such a strange and beautiful place. it is hard to describe ,other than Faerie Glen. All kinds of mounds and mountains and rocks to climb. Some can be a little scary, so if you have little ones be careful. So worth the trip, as it is off the beaten path and there are",
          "This was our first stop of the & the Fairy Glen did not disappoint. Because we arrived so early in the morning we were the only people! It was a magical place and we saw many birds, sheep, and bunnies as we explored. We printed out the trail directions from the Walking",
          "This little spot would be easy to overlook and what a shame that would be. Very popular place for your kids to explore.",
          "This place is both weird and wonderful, a little glen of emerald green grassy hillocks and winding little creeks. From the top of the 'castle' you can see rather large waterfalls across the opposing valley. A fun diversion for an hour or so, probably not much longer. Would",
          "We came across this beautiful little glen on our recent holiday. We had fantasic weather and we all enjoyed the walk through the little picturesque fairy glen. Quaint little hills and very friendly sheep !!",
          "Myself and couple of friends visited the Faerie Glen this evening. It was a beautiful evening just perfect for a relaxed wander around exploring the quaint fairy circles and lush green hills. Views are stunning, would recommend a visit as well worth it.",
          "This is a small and pretty place, but spoilt by the odd stone spirals, which include one that is supposedly a sculpture, and as a result feels manufactured for tourists. Plenty of tour groups arriving and departing while we were there and impossible to take a photo without",
          "Faerie Glen was a nice little surprise. After doing research came to the conclusion it would take about half an hour to get to the actual glen, we were wrong! You can basically drive right up to it! We spent about 30 minutes wandering around, I'm sure you could easily spend up",
          "Interesting for a half hour visit, if you are in the area. Not a must do, IMO. Smaller kids might enjoy it more than my teens. There were many people there when we went. It would be more \"magical\" if it wasn't so crowded.",
          "These funky green hills provide a nice area to get out and stretch your legs while touring the island. Some of the trails up to the main outcropping can be muddy and slippery so bring good boots and don't be afraid to get a little dirty. Also, the narrow single tract road down",
          "This is ok but there are so many more amazing places to visit on Skye. If this was the first place I had visited I would have rated it much higher but it does pale in comparison to other places. If you have done everything and were looking for an extra place to visit then this",
          "Quite enjoyable. Felt like we were in a the Lord or the Rings movie. Natural beauty, green and lush.",
          "Had been recommended to go here by a friend (I had never heard of it before) and it was my favourite attraction in the whole of Skye! Not too busy and hard to find as we missed the road to turn off. The hills are beautiful, the valley is lovely and green and there's a small loch",
          "A bit off the beaten track, this charming little glen seems like a movie set. The naturally formed hills create a beautiful and dare I say magical setting. (Take the road that bears to the right from the min road on the approach to Uig, just before you pass the turret on the",
          "We had a little trouble finding this location but so happy that we did! The views are lovely! There are several places to pull over to start up the trails. Large trailers may have troubles finding parking.",
          "When driving north turn right on the road just before the Uig hotel (no signs). Drive until you reach a pond on your right and your there. The faerie glen was really cool we spent lots of time hiking around and taking photos. Definitely worth checking out!",
          "This place is lovely and idyllic and fairly easily accessible by car. You do need to pay attention when driving on the main road to Uig, Faery Glen is not marked at all. I took a (bad) picture to show you the way. In return I ask nothing but to keep this place unharmed and",
          "This is a lovely spot that was created by landslides! It looks eerie and unnatural, like a place where wee faeries would live. There aren't any. The tourists have chased them away, but there appear to be attempts to bring sacred energy to the place. There is a labyrinth under",
          "We kind of just came across it, needed to ask for directions in Uig, but basically just look for Uig Hotel, not sure it was worth it, it's quaint and pretty, to be fair, we didn't stop and explore properly, after climbing Old Man of Storr then driving up Quaraing this seemed a",
          "It was a really fascinating place, with unusual features formed many many years ago, but there was little information saying how it came about, which would have been interesting. Nice and quiet when we visited, so walking around was lovely",
          "Off the beaten path. Took a bit of work to find it but when we did, it was well worth it. Such a wonderful and secret place, not many tourists at all unlike the faerie pools.",
          "Not the easiest place to find but definitely worth the journey. Look for the bench overlooking the lake and start walking around the lake.",
          "Pretty much every review I've written about my trip to Scotland has mentioned the GREEN. We don't get to see much of that where I'm from. At Faerie Glen, it was nearly overwhelming, and I'm not even joking. To find this place, turn off A87 right before reaching the Uig Hotel",
          "This was by far one of my favorites spots to visit on the Isle of Skye. The landscape is unique unlike anything I have seen before. We enjoyed climbing up and the view from the top of the \"castle\" was stunning.",
          "Great place to visit, the waterfalls and pools are beautiful especially on a sunny day. Go with decent footwear as it is an uneven path and a water crossing.",
          "it looks like something out of one of a fairy tale, with dwarf like trees, mounds, and unusual rock formations. It's a great photo op and well worth a short side-trip.",
          "Just like all the other bits of Scotland, this place looks magical as well. You can easily spend 1hr here. Very few spots for parking. Lots of good pictures of trails can be taken here.",
          "This was a bit hard to find but worth looking at. It's a beautiful and very interesting area. I didn't spend much time walking around but it was worth driving through to check it out.",
          "I visited this attraction at 5pm when the rain was lashing down. I still really enjoyed it as the atmosphere felt magical. I hope to return on my next trip as I didnt spend a lot of time there due to the weather.",
          "I absolutely loved visiting the Faerie Glen, with its pointed hills and deep, rich colours, and ruins. Truly magical. As always I would definately recommend to see them as early as possible in the morning before it gets swamped with tourists, if you want \"tourist free\"photos.",
          "This location off the beaten path is so unique - we had never seen geologic formations like it before. it was lambing season so the glen was filled with ewes and their lambs which made it even more magical. Kind of hard to find...turn east on the road just south of the Uig hotel",
          "We went here on the way home from another attraction so didn't spend as long as we would have liked. Nice to climb up the small mounds or just walk through the Faerie glen at your leisure.",
          "What a strange place this is. Land formations so interesting and difficult to describe. The area is quite small and I am sure that the volume of traffic and walkers (and noise) during peak times would not make this place seem so magical. As it was, we were almost on our own",
          "Loved walking around the hills of the Fairy glen. A lovely stop and worth the visit...even though there were others milling about, it was still a lovely peaceful place to visit.",
          "We loved this hidden gem. There aren't any specific signs that point to where it is, but it's a short walk after the car park. Just follow your gps and it will lead you there. At first it may look like you're walking to nowhere, but once you make that right turn, you'll see it.",
          "Beautiful, we had a cloudy day and still looks amazing It's very easy to get there (I don't understand why I read that was hidden and difficult to find) it's just one way path until the place",
          "Very beautiful and interesting place with great views and well worth a visit. We caught the bus from Portree to Uig - there's a bus stop at Faerie Glen but the road doesn't tell you and the bus won't stop unless you ask it to. Couple of miles walk from the bigger road again, but",
          "Short walk from Uig with lovely views. The hike isn't too taxing and the natural features are something to behold. It does have a magical feel and the young ones will really enjoy it too.",
          "We went out of our way to visit the Faerie Glen and we're glad we did. Parking can be difficult if it is busy. The topography is quite unusual and I haven't seen anything like it before. It is great for walking around, up and down the hills and to the top of the 'castle' if you",
          "Not well signed but just before you come in to Uig and by the big white church. You need to use your imagination in this place but the small hills and topography are quite intriguing. This place is on such a miniature scale that you can climb all the little hummocks within half",
          "Intensely Green and Lush; The scenery is striking at times. Must see if in the Scottish Highlands. Roads leading up are tight and 1 lane for both directions. Tours do operate in the area as we had to pass some small buses at times. If in the Uig area, don't miss as it is a free",
          "Very pretty little place with a very interesting landscape. Short hike from the very small car park. It is uphill, but it is an easy and small hill. Someone arranged a small group of stones in a spiral pattern to enhance the landscape an make it appear more mystical. As you",
          "True to its name, Faerie Glen can be a magical little place with some imagination. It's not difficult to get to by car, and we saw a few people eating their packed lunches on the stone wall, which was a cute idea. Wish we had thought of that!",
          "Very interesting landscape. It does look just like a place for fairies! Nice stop. Glad we were on a tour so our guide did the driving on that narrow road!",
          "The Glen is beautiful! Its full of small hills and lakes with heaps of paths for you to explore. Its out of the way though, on a one lane windy road. If you get the chance then I recommend that you visit but it isn't a must see.",
          "was quiet hard to find but was worth it,the views are stunning from the top of the hills,it is very popular was lot of folk there.it is well worth trying to find,we did find it with help from locals with directions.",
          "This is worth a detour on your Island mapping. Good picnic spot and unusual shapes and landscapes plus a easy accessible jelly leg exposed point up the ruined castle on offer to add to the fun of the more daring or for a bit of fun. Someone described this as a bit 'middle earth'",
          "We stopped here first thing in the morning on our tour of Skye so there were not many other tourists there at the time. The Circles are quite interesting and the view from the top of Castle Ewan was gorgeous! The only downside to this location is that to fully experience the",
          "Unusual grassy knolls make up this area, good for having an explore in the ups and downs, valleys and secluded little areas it creates. Some little areas with lots of moss on trees and stones makes for pretty photos. We spent maybe two hours here. Not enough parking however,",
          "Please make time if you can for this short detour off the main Uig/Portree road. Utterly delightful and (as a non geological type) mysterious landscape. Why it wasn't used in the filming of a hundred magical mythical adventures can only be explained by the tricky single track",
          "I love it here. This is an interesting place on the face of it but requires you to have a little imagination and magic in your soul to get the best out of a trip here I think. There is not a lot to see or do if you require entertaining and it's a long drive from anywhere.",
          "This was a beautiful and easy stroll through this magical glen! I would definitely recommend this walk for families with small children or folks who are not super mobile (we saw very young kids and senior folks here). This was on the top of my list of things to see and do",
          "Please if you visit dont leave coins or trinkets. The sheep will eat them & we were told last year the farmer had 2 die from eating them.",
          "We did not know what to expect before we arrived. We drove up from Uig on a single track road and parked just off said road. Having adorned our walking boots we frolicked through the spectacular landscape climbing the little and the not so little hills. The 'castle'is the big",
          "Good walking shoes needed if you want to properly explore - it's definitely worth going up to the castle. Lovely spot.",
          "Well off the beaten track about 7miles from main road. Have to keep an eye out for the small sign opposite junction or you'll miss it. Worth the drive though. Climb to the top for the magical view of below. But of climbing through narrow gap at top",
          "The fairy glen itself is unmarked so you need to have faith and make the turn off at Balnaknock on the road to Uig. This little gem is serene and basically a miniature landscape. The conical hills are particularly cute and it is fun to go up to the fairy castle. Be careful",
          "I heard about the glen from a locale but accidentally drove by it several times, finally got there on my last night well timed at the golden hour and could not have been more excited!! It was a magical place, with limited parking but easy to explore! Highly recommend!",
          "One of my favourite stops. All of Uig is magical and beautiful! You will truly be in awe of this remarkable landmark and can picture fairies living there! It's out of a fantasy novel/movie. If you are able, make sure you climb to the highest peak. It was worth the view and",
          "Fantastic scenery, hard to believe it is not hand made. No specific walking path, just go and discover.",
          "We stopped here with a Skye tour and it was awesome. There was one other group here at the time but with several paths there were times I felt like I had the place to myself. The conical hills are quite a site. The main path up gets you to these hills from which you can climb",
          "Not as much tourists as other attractions. Lovely place to visit, lots hills. Feel like in Fairytale land. Going up and down the hills great fun.",
          "This was the highlight of our Scotland holiday. There were many hills and paths to explore and all surrounded by stunning scenery. We loved visiting off season and took the opportunity to cycle from the hotel in Uig. It is not signposted to take the road that goes behind the",
          "We absolutely love exploring the Faerie Glen and never tire of it's magical look. The windswept, weirdly shappen mounds, Castle Ewen and the little lochan add to it's charm. You can spend hours going up and down, over and under, through trees, finding streams and never be more",
          "This really is unlike anything else on Skye! Worth a visit and you can climb the hills to get great views (and pictures!). Their texture is very unique. Plenty of parking around the area and also great for people who have mobility issues and just want to see them without having",
          "Really incredible spot. But no parking and a narrow lane so be patient with the drive in and out. Otherwise, top notch.",
          "It was tricky to find as there is no signage and no phone signal for online maps. It is in a place on the edge of Uig called Balnanock. The place was bigger than expected and offered a chance to have a little stomp around. There are places you could have a picnic and is",
          "We hiked all around the Faerie Glen and went to the highest point which had wonderful views. My kids and I absolutely loved walking all around the Faerie Glen. It is very close to the Uig Hotel and a fantastic place to visit.",
          "Although we had a little trouble finding it, it was worth the effort! (it's not sign-posted). Our children loved it, as did we :)",
          "Unusual triangular shaped land formations, apparently a myth surrounds the area as being connected with fairies, interesting BUT the local area seem as if they don't want the intrusion ..... no signs to help tourists reach there and no parking ? Poor !",
          "It's name is really suitable cause it really is like a fairy tale there.. We went in April and weather was clear. It is a short walk round the hills..",
          "Truly enchanting. We had it to ourselves for a while and I got to walk the spiral. Then 2 bus loads of selfie sticks showed up and the place was swarming with tourists. Ah well...can't have it all. Still, I'd make a point to visit.",
          "A lovely glen and easy walk. A great way to get the children's imaginations running with dreams of looking for fairies. Very scenic.",
          "Great walk - felt like Middle Earth! Plenty of tracks and hills to explore or you can stick to the road. It's easy enough to climb to the top of the largest 'rock' - just a short exposed ridge and a little scramble to the end, makes it enough of an expedition without too much",
          "I've visited Skye several times but never been to Faerie Glen. It wasn't clearly sign posted so nearly missed out on visiting and what a loss that would have been. This is a truly magical glen, steeped in history and myth. We were there on a glorious sunny day which showed off",
          "Take time to walk around and enjoy the full experience of Faerie Glen.Surprisingly you can find yourself away from the madding crowd surrounded by an amazing landscape.",
          "Love the greenery. Cannot quite understand some of the things. However, this place looks like it could be from the time of the druids and Merlin. Quite magical. And really pretty.",
          "It looks like a location straight out of Middle Earth, and is worth a visit (there are no facilities there at all) but it is small, and so can easily get over run with visitors, which somewhat spoils it's seclusion, beauty, and tranquility.",
          "It IS a magical place. The energy has to be experienced. The air vibrates. The wind whispers. I'm not kidding. It was that special. You can walk around and peek at all the nooks and crannies in the woodland and feel a warm, benevolent caress from something in the air. Do not",
          "This is probably one of the most magical places I've ever visited. It is a definite must-see. We visited with a group tour, and spent quite a long time walking around exploring the area. While walking around, you can feel magic in the air and almost feel like you can't talk",
          "A lovely place for kiddies and picnics. I went with my wife, the two of us were equally entertained despite the rain. Very quiet and mysterious. Didnt see any pixie folk but I did spot some very rare flora for any of you who like nature.",
          "Most magical and fun place, rocks to climb and amazing little hill formations. We were lucky to see it on a cold yet sunny day, with a frozen lake. Beautiful!",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit, but with slippery rocks on the path. Be sure to wear suitable shoes and water proved jacket. In Scotland, the weather changed within a blink. The waterfalls on the way are magnificent.",
          "Really unusual landscape and great for kids' imaginations. Smaller legs might need a hand, particularly when it's been wet as you are wandering around hills and there aren't any paths. Don't expect a huge car park either. That sounds like 2 negatives but just watch outs - once",
          "We wouldn't have visited here if we hadn't been on a Rabbie's tour. Incredible formations and the \"Immortality\" pond. Definitely worth parking your vehicle and exploring all the unusual hills.",
          "I'd never seen a stranger but more beautiful landscape in my years. It's easy to see how the Faerie Glen could inspire belief in the phantasmic and supernatural. It looks like something right out of a Dr. Seuss book. I kept waiting for the Faeries themselves to pop out of a bush.",
          "Unfortunately the faeries were out today on a hike to the faerie pools but we still managed to catch their circles and visited their homes. The view from the top of the Castle Ewan was breathtaking. We also found a little faerie forest close by and got lost in a magical place.",
          "This place was beautiful. Great, easy hike for my 5 and 11 year old boys. They had a lot of fun exploring this unique and magical place.",
          "This is worth the drive to experience. Beware there isn't any parking to speak of and roads are narrow, most people are pulled over on the edge of the road. We climbed to the top ( and were nearly blown away) but it was worth it. Great views and made for stunning pics. Worth a",
          "Great landscape with a beautiful view over plain fields. Even spotted two waterfalls on the other side. It's a really tranquill piece of nature which makes you feel calm. The surroundings are quite slippery, but with some good shoes it does not prove a problem at all. Take a",
          "We visited the Faerie Glen at the end of a long day and did not expect much. But it ended up being such a wonderful surprise! It is easy to reach by car and fun to explore on foot - many hobbit-sized hills overlook miniature valleys and copses of trees, sheep graze freely, and",
          "We walked up to the faerie glen as we were staying right near it. Once we got there we were not disappointed, the place is amazing. The view from the top of the castle is beautiful and we were super lucky to have had lovely weather.",
          "The drive to reach the Faerie Glen was single track so the anticipation alone was good. Once you see the odd little hills and peaks it really makes you feel like you have found yourself somewhere really special. Good for a walk and photo opportunity, parking can be difficult",
          "The faerie Glen is a place i highly recommend visiting in the Isle of Skye. The drive to it has the most amazing mountain views. I have never seen anything like it in my life!! Unfortunately it was raining when we got there but we didn't let it ruin our experience! It just added",
          "I know it's all myths and legends but it's easy to forget surrounded by the odd shaped mounds and the spooky fairy circle hidden behind the Fairy Castle. Beautiful views and an active climb for young and old - or just a casual stroll if you're not feeling energetic.",
          "Charming and fun, walk around the picturesque hills, climb on them and frolic like children, enjoy the quiet and pastoral and shoot a lot of photos, a nice place and welcoming, you can enjoy this beauty, this reserve recommends two to three hours.",
          "It was fun to hike up the hills of faerie glen. The whole place felt so unique and eerie like nothing I've seen before. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Isle of Skye is certainly not for the adventurous traveler. More of a weekend away from the hustle and bustle if you are local to the UK. We were too early in the season for any spring bloom, but the trip to Fairy Glen was the most scenic and interesting spot we saw while we",
          "Wonderful, ethereal place! I had trouble finding it as there was no signage (maybe there was but it was only in Gaelic). I asked at the small shop on the side of the road and doubled back to take the road I had passed. I stopped on the side of the road after I came around a turn",
          "I had googled faerie glen but seeing it in real life was much better - it truly is a special place - the whole family loved it, from the castle to the mounds, toadstools, stone circles and the cool waterfall - a definite must see especially for young families.",
          "stunning views all round it one of the prettiest places in skye,keep a eye out for eagles .its a nice walk to the fairy pools but better on a sunny day .",
          "Enchanting and ethereal, this natural wonder is off the beaten track but despite its tucked away location it attracts way too many and the wrong 'sort' of tourists (the 'helter-skelter, whistle-stop minibus loads of checkoff-listers' who dash about this island from place to",
          "We visited the Fairy Glen on a damp, but not raining, autumn afternoon. This was my 6 year olds very favorite spot on the Isle of Skye. My 7 year old loved it too. They loved zipping up and down the hills and all of the little well worn paths up and down the hill sides. Prior to",
          "A most enjoyable walk with stunning vistas all round. Don't expect too much from the so called 'fairy pools'.",
          "This place is amazing geographical wonder It can be slippy and muddy underfoot. plenty of little mounds to climb",
          "What w place, worth the drive ti the end of the island. We spent there several good hours and enjoyed the magical place.",
          "Compared to other attractions situated on the Isle of Skye the Faerie Glen is completely underrated! The whole area has a magical feel to it and regardless of where you look or stand, you are surrounded by real wilderness and beauty. Make sure you wear comfortable footwear, as",
          "This place is situated about 2 miles outside Uig and is not sign posted so take directions before you go or use a Sat Nav as it is not easy to find. It is so unexpected and has a very unusual landscape. There is minimal parking in the area. There is a small walk involved which",
          "A group of us recently came here while touring Scotland and the Isle of Skye. What a magical place this is. A few of us climbed to the top of the highest point of the glen, and a few of us climbed up a smaller hill opposite the tallest point. It's just gorgeous to look down over",
          "We want here as part of a day trip, it was a 45 minute wander, great for taking photos on a sunny day and it was a really nice place to visit! It is a green stretch of land made so unusual because there are many grassy slopes, bumps, lumps and hills. Great for kids to have a",
          "The Faerie glen was the highlight of my trip to Skye. There are so many places to explore and amazing views! Loved every minute here. It was truly magical It is slippery and muddy so be prepared, it is a little off the beaten track so not to many tourists in the Autumn months.",
          "Wonderful unique place. Has an other worldly feel to it. From the rock towers above you can look down on little lakes and hillocks. Highly recommended.",
          "Amazing scenery and geology in this remote glen. Been visiting Skye for years and found it for the first time. I will return!",
          "Walking on the Faerie Glen felt like I was somehow in the middle of a miniature version of Scotland. We walked around and spend a lovely hour just filling our imagination with the serene beauty of the glen. The place felt magical! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Another of Skye's stunning natural landscapes that leave you amazed and dumfounded in equal measure. This is the third visit to the Faerie Glen and each time I approach I feel like I have arrived at Hobbiton in Middle Earth. I don't think I will ever get bored exploring this",
          "Loved this! The hills were so unusually. Everything was so green. We hiked up many of them. The pond made a great back drop for pictures. It was windy. I forgot my tennis shoes and just had on clogs - made it more difficult to climb.",
          "We were on a small group tour of Scotland. Near Uig on the Isle of Skye, our driver suddenly turned off onto a single track road. He wouldn't tell us why until we came over a hill and saw the area of drumlins known as the Faerie Glen. There was a collective Wow! as we came",
          "Another stunning place on this fascinating island. It's a fairly easy walk/slight climb but worth it as the views are amazing. We took a picnic lunch, there's no coffee shop or cafe/pub around thankfully, I just hope it stays that way. So often places like this that attract",
          "Nice place to stop and hike around. Parking is limited. We took a picnic lunch. Found a nice spot to sit and enjoy the view. There were many families here. Lots of room for everyone to romp around. Some hiking is on steep hills. Sheep hanging around to watch. Nice little",
          "An interesting and easy short walk through this unusual landscape. Conical mounds give this place an almost mystical feel. Very picturesque.",
          "An absolutely beautiful spot to visit and wander round. The natural formations look like Hobbit homes rising out of the ground. If you enjoy a wee ramble then this is a lovely spot to walk and have a picnic",
          "Fantastic visit to a wondrous world straight from another dimension. Took the grand kids here and they loved running about the little grassy mounds shaped in strange shapes covering a huge area topped off by the fairy castle pinnacle. I have been past here many times and never",
          "Easy(paved) drive off the main road. No car park but the single lane road has some pull off areas to park. The topography is really interesting and offers a lot of hiking opportunities. To get the best views you will need to hike up a few hills. The road to enter is just",
          "Went here with a bus full of passengers. It's a weird n wonderful place just looking of for faeries hiding in the hillside",
          "Not easy to find without a map, this is a quiet, secluded spot featuring oddly shaped hills around a central castle like rock outcrop. Not a whole day out but worth a look",
          "Worth a visit but go early as limited roadside parking. No signs but worth finding it Great for kids and adults alike. Lovely wee paths and great views.",
          "Some interesting conical hills amongst the scenery. Parking a bit of a problem though. After a short climb up a large rock you get a fine all round view. Nice to see, but not a place to spend too much time at.",
          "No really knowing what to expect, I'm so glad we made the effort to come here! It truly is like something out of a fairytale book and very much worth a visit. It's not the easiest place to find as its not signposted and doesn't have a sat nav postcode. You need to head to",
          "not sure where we first read about this but we read this is not sign posted but you know you are there, and this is so true, you will find this place as you are coming into uig on the main A87 you will see a sign to your right which says Balnaknock follow this road and you will",
          "We had seen pictures of the glen on pinter estate while planning our trip but we really had no idea what we were coming to see or what it would be like. It's a bit of a trek to get there (as everything is on Skye) but 100% worth it (as everything is on Skye). It was raining when",
          "I visited this twice once by minibus and once on foot after using the local bus.Its about a half hour walk each way,but not unpleasant on a dry day and the scenery approachng the Glen is attractive.Not that much to see there but worth doing all the same .",
          "From Portree, take road to Uig. When close to town, the Uig Hotel is on your right. The road to Farrie Glen is a small road immediately BEFORE the hotel. This is a typical single lane Scotland farm road so take your time. After about 2 miles you go across a cattle",
          "limited parking so get there early. its not signed from the road so you will need your map. lovely place for a wander about",
          "Must see this beautiful landscape when in the Isle of Skye! Picturesque and worth the trek to the top of the hill.",
          "Really stay away from this unbelievably wonderful place. Don't go because it looks like lord of the rings was made here Don't climb the amazing hills or look at the amazing views Stay away, it's too crowded already",
          "Contrary to Felicia N's admonition, our guide (not Rabbie) begged us not to drop coins. He mentioned two sheep have died already. They were someone's livelihood. It is a beautiful spot, please don't despoil it.",
          "A must for anybody visiting the Isle of Sky, it seems and feels magically ancient. You can see why its named the Faerie Glen",
          "Driving up the road where the Faerie Glen is located, and you try and work out what it could be, or where it is.. Then all of a sudden, you turn a corner and you are in another land. Beautiful - Highly recommended to come and see this hidden gem.",
          "Such a lovely place, it feels like it's just you and nature there, and well, sheep obviously. Very relaxing place",
          "Incredibly beautiful place. I think if the day had been sunny rather than gray and overcast I might have passed out from how beautiful it was here. I didn't have time to climb all the way up to the tower (we were on a Rabbie's Tour) but everywhere you looked was pretty so I",
          "we were told about this enchanting place but without local knowledge you would never find it ? theres no sign posts for it anywhere we had our b&b proprietors map which he had marked for us or our visit to the faerie glen wouldnt have happened ? but even with the map we",
          "My wife and I had planned to go to Faerie Glen during our time in Skye and it was pretty cool. Not the easiest place to find (no signs!) however once we got there it was like stepping in to a fantasy movie. We happened to have great weather (overcast, no rain), and it added to",
          "What a lovely place to visit, not sign posted but recommended in the book 'Scotland the Best'. Good area to get out for a walk around and definitely feels magical. One of our favourite places on Skye.",
          "We made a stop here as a part of our 5 day tour and thought it was an amazing spot. A fun little hike up, it was so green and so picturesque. Definitely like something out of a fairy tale. We climbed up to the peak and wow, what a sight! Not for those afraid of a little",
          "Very much like my Old Man of Storr review get there early before all the coaches turn up or late evening to have it for yourself. It's an amazing place to visit, spoiler alert There are no Faeries to be seen, maybe they exist ,maybe they don't but stop leaving sweets for them as",
          "You feel that there is something special about this place. They filmed part of the movie Stardust at this location. Where you see a witch cooking beside a pool.",
          "close to Uig (boat to harris-lewis), literally a couple of miles drive. a very particular scenery that is surely worth the trip. i suggest walking on the hills, especially on the north side of the road, you will uncover nice views and spots.",
          "A magical location but quite busy. A great place to visit and I would recommend. Ample parking , don't forget decent boots and walking sticks if you are a little unsteady on your feet. Loved the place.",
          "We had to drive down a single lane road that was filled with jaw dropping views. It was so quiet and serene.",
          "The site tool a bit of wandering up into the steep sides of the road but boy was it worth the hike! Gorgeous doesn't even begin to describe this view. Close to Uig and the main roads it was easy enough to find the start to the trail. Our whole group found something to photograph",
          "You've got to see it to believe it, quite frankly its was a bit like being in Lord of the rings, it's beautiful it's strange it's quite it's got sheep of course, it's a great place to stop and eat your lunch if you've packed up, then walk around and see the stone circles the",
          "Spectacular! One of the most, if not The Most mesmerizing places I have ever seen. The sheep roam up and down the hills and have carved stepping stone pathways that allow one to climb to the top. Calming and peacefu- this place is a dream. If you didn't believe in fairies",
          "a short drive from Uig and Cuil Lodge, the Faerie Glen has to be seen to understand! take the time and you'll love it's quiet and intriguing geography- an interesting contrast to the wider vistas of the rest of the island",

          "Single track road with passing places. Prepare for any type of weather. It was worth walking around or if you don't like to walk you can view from the vehicle window. It is worth doing some walking to get different angles of landscape.",
          "When you first see this place you do feel like you've wandered into a dream or a film set, Scotland has got so much natural beauty it's hard to describe but this is one of the most magical places. The small green mounds look like fairy homes and a there is small stone circles",
          "I loved this place. It is like you are in your own fairytale. It is a beautiful place. You can have some awesome walks (hikes) here and climb up the fairy castle. The views are amazing. There are too a lot of Sheep, so you can enjoy the nature and animals and make some awesome",
          "Not to be missed!!! Although you could very easily miss it.. Thanks to previous reviewers we found it.. Immediate left after Hotel Uig - an \"interesting\" drive along the single track road! Easy climbs up the little hills and mounds, kids would love it and us adults with good",
          "Though parking was crowded, once out of the car the mounds were spectacular and fun. You climb them using well defined paths, that can be slippy in wet weather to get fine views - but it is the conical shape of the mounds that is so unexpected. This is a different experience,",
          "We visited the Faerie Glen, on the Isle of Skye a few days ago. It was absolutely delightful. The little pond, peculiar hills and craggy outcrop create a magical place! My family spent over an hour exploring and taking countless pictures. If you are planning to head to the",
          "Lovely magical place. Our tour guide told us stories of Faeries. It's easy to see how this place would have inspired stories about Faeries.",
          "Close to the main road and Uig, it's well-worth a wander around or picnic lunch. We'll be returning to maybe spend a night among the fairy-hills.",
          "Whereas it took my friend to climb to the base of the Old Man of Storr to realize how enormous it is, it helps to have a bunch of friends or sheep climbing the hills of the Fairy Glen to realize just how small they are. This place is great for people looking for a fun romp",
          "Words or pictures cannot describe just how amazing and magical this place is. It actually feels like fairies are hiding around. It was something our of a Shakespeare play. It's a little difficult to find because there are no signs but definitely worth stopping by. The drive to",
          "came here to get a couple of geocaches found. What a great place to visit. Must be one of the must visit places on Skye. The landscape is astounding and must be viewed. Glad we came here as we would have been sorry to miss it.",
          "Unusual landscape which is worth stopping off to explore on the way through Uig. No sign posts so make sure you know which turning to take. Parking at both ends of the Glen.",
          "We went to the Faerie Glen on a misty, overcast day. Despite the drizzle, it was fun to hike up the hill. Enjoyed a lovely couple of hours walking among the sheep and viewing the stone circles and labyrinth.",
          "Hard to find but it was worth turning back and getting there eventually. Lots of people went to see the rock and then turned back, I'm glad we had a good wander around and found a special glade and a hidden waterfall. Didn't see any faeries but I think they may have been hiding.",
          "Seeing the Faerie Glen I understand why and from where the faerie myth came from. The place is truly magical! Unfortunately is not very well known or advertised, there are no roadsigns to tell you where to go to find it. As you make your way on the A87 south of Uig, pass by",
          "First and foremost, coordinates for those looking to find this place: 57.583976, -6.329053. This will take you to a siding where around four cars can be parked. There is some places further along, but use considerately because they are passing places and locals do live and work",
          "This is a very pretty and compact area.It is a bit like a small scale Quirang, but much easier to explore.Sadly recently some tour companies have encouraged their guests to leave gifts for the faeries.This is really dangerous for the grazing sheep and other wild life.Actually",

          "A fantastic place to visit. A small stream, waterfall and amazing landscape makes the faerie Glen my favourite place on skye. Off road parking and a small walk then you are free to explore. Children and all ages would love this place. The hills are unusual in shape which makes",

          "This place was especially fun with kids who went wild climbing and exploring. Great small side trip for a morning or afternoon... not on a rainy day.",
          "We did not know about this place until our WOW Scotland Tour brought us here. It is a beautiful sight in any weather. Please be respectful of the sheep as they are someone's property and do not leave your garbage behind.",
          "A very beautiful spot to visit, the terrain is breathtakingly beautiful and resembles something from a fairytale. Please respect this place when you visit, tourists are damaging this beautiful landscape by climbing up the little hills, the road goes through the middle of it so",
          "A wonderful place but please leave nothing but footsteps, take nothing but photos. The 'offerings' for the fairies are just litter by another name. The oriental style stone towers are out of place in Scotland and dangerous when they fall. Come and wander in this magical,",

          "Faerie Glen is tucked away and it can be seemingly hard to find, but once you do it is a gem of a place to walk around and enjoy the ambiance, sheep, deep greens of the foliage and uniqueness of the landscape. It is not completely natural... people have placed stones in patterns",
          "A beautiful hidden wonderland!! We loved running up and down the hills. A very magical place. Highly recommend visiting!!",
          "Well worth a visit! You could spend an hour or two here on a nice day (we spent 30-40 as it was raining), perfect for a picnic. It is really pretty and near Ewen castle. The main fun part is climbing all the mounds around the area. Parking is found about 400m before the glen,",
          "Absolutely amazing\u2026.perfect for solos, couples and families who love to hike. Parking can be tricky as there is no designated parking lot\u2026 so it is catch as catch can. If it is rainy, bring boots and rain jacket. Bring your camera and be prepared to be amazed.",
          "Amazed that this area even exists. You can't tell from the road, and your basically driving thru peoples back yards to get to it, but once you get there it's amazing. Just hills, streams and vegetation, but it looks like it should be in a Hobbit movie. Kids would love it.",
          "Lovely walk over hills and good high vantage points Needs to be restricted as cars are ruining road side and people need to be more Respectful of property. Lovely walk and view of waterfalls",
          "Well worth a visit on a sunny, calm day, or a magical tour on a misty morning. The hills are peppered with trees and bushes, there is a beautiful large pond, and seat provided for anyone who wishes to sit and relax in this delightful area. This is a very calm and peaceful area,",
          "This was one of our favorite places on Skye (though admittedly, we only spent 2 days on Skye). Totally worth wandering around for a few hours. Some crazy high places, so not for those afraid of heights. However, this is just a place you'll come to if you turn off the road",
          "If God decided to create a natural playground to explore it would look a lot like the Fairy Glen just outside Uig. Easy climbs and small peaks with a different view at every turn and all in a very compact area (you could stroll from end to end in 10 minutes). The hills are",

I think they are affecting the wildlife around. You can reach the main spot after 5-10 mins of hike. It's uphill but not very hard. I'd recommend to see this spot if you are around.",
          "Still is a place worth visiting, even though people told us it is not how it used to be, as visitors took all the stones. A very short walk there and you can easily climb on the small hills all around it to get nice viewpoints. If you're passing by it, I definitely recommend you stop and visit this place!",
          "Magical landscape hidden away in amongst the larger mountains. Looks to be heavily used by tourists in certain seasons as there's a lot of erosion to all the pathways. Try to go out of season and you can really enjoy the peaceful miniature works where you can imagine mythical creatures might live!",

          "Beautiful on a quiet day, but do not expect the same experience when it is busy.  Cars will be parked everywhere, spoiling the landscape as the narrow road goes right through the middle.  But without all the people, the place itself is really interesting and pretty.",

          "It was not signposted at all very awkward to find and all the stones have been stolen. Quite dissapointing at least the surrounding hills were quite cool. As of 2020 the easiest way to find the circle is to walk up where the sign is that \u2026",
          "Despite this being a very small area there were a surprising amount of visitors, possibly everyone hoping to get off the beaten tracks and ending up in the same place. There\u2019s actually parking for maybe 8 cars, despite the location pin on \u2026",

          "Very cute and magical place. The hike up is fairly steep but it's not long. Once you reach the glen, it's pretty simple to walk and explore. You can spend easily a couple of hours here, taking it cool and having a picnic on one of the hills. We loved our day surrounded by the beautiful greenery.",
          "This place is very beautiful and you are free to separate yourself from other crowds and explore freely wherever you like. We spent about 2 hours here but could easily spend more time. Great views in all directions. Once you park the trail will be on the  right side not the left.",
          "Such a beautiful spot, and a must stop if you're on the Isle of Sky. The road to it is very small and parking is just on the side of the road, but we managed to get a spot",
          "Very pretty, and very distinctive land formations. Even with so many tourists it seemed somewhat magical. Even arriving relatively early three were many people, and as we left the number of cars driving in was enormous: so come very early to get the most out of it (and the light would be best then, too).",

And folks, you're going there to see nature at its best, why destroy it with your car? One beautiful location, with a mystical touch to it.",
          "Great tourist attraction. It is a little bit of a squeeze to get to the \"castle\" bit but is doable. Parking can be a bit tight if it is a busy day, please respect the signs and do not park in passing places\nThere are rock circles created by \u2026",

          "not to be missed! we walked here from Uig village which took us about 35 min.  The place is great for nature lovers.  there are lots of opportunities to make an easy hike across some of the hills around.  We visited in May which added a lot of colors - all fresh green! Must see.",
          "The fairy circle is located behind the hills. From the road you need to walk a little around the hills. It was a little slippery so make sure to wear proper footwear. The view is breathtaking so totally worth it. Perfect spot to enjoy the scenic beauty and the quiet atmosphere.",

          "Otherworldly, beautiful place, but you have to be there to feel it, photography just can't convey the atmosphere.",
          "If there are fairies hiding in the world, they're here. Even from a distance this landscape sticks out as different (in a good way)! It's a very short walk up the hill to get to the \"fairy glen\", and its a fun place for kids to explore. Be respectful of the fairy circles!",
          "What a beautiful hidden gem in the skye,though the car park is limited",
          "This is an incredible place to visit. You should really try to have about 3 hours to crawl all over this place. There are so may really cool pieces to explore. It does feel like it could be a magical place.",

          "Splendid any weather or time of the year.",

          "Wonderful. Probably better in summer",
          "It's a real shame that the amount of people visiting is leaving it's mark. I picked up lots of bits of rubbish today. It's a beautiful place. Just sad that it's not being looked after by the visitors. Lots of erosion. Stick to paths and \u2026",

Don't put stones in circle, that's not a thing. Stop trying to make it a thing. Walking around the area in a circular motion destroys the fragile habitat. Visit, but be respectful.",

          "I totally loved this place!",
          "Amazing experience.\nI feel magic power in my bones",
          "Beautiful and easily accessible location, though parking can be a bit tricky on busy times. If you like take some photos at the little lake, explore the small various hills around you for your best photo shots and climb up the 'castle' for \u2026",
          "The Fairy Glen itself was a little underwhelming, however wandering around the surrounding area was stunning and I\u2019m so glad we went! I can hear it gets very busy and crowded but we lucked out and were the only car when we arrived. Others did start to join us later.",
          "Lovely spot to clamber up to and survey ones surroundings. Parking is problematic and cramped to be kind to each other.",
          "A magical wee glen with walking paths and stunning views, as long as the weather's holding up.",
          "Absolutely lovely place. Rolling hills, sweet soft grass and s beautiful place to watch the sunset. Between the rocks.",
          "An ethereal feeling when you see this place. No, it's not really been associated with faeries or magic in the past. But it is unique geology and is both easy and hard to climb, as you choose. And there are places that are actually \u2026",
          "Beautiful but absolutely overrun with visitors - good luck finding anywhere to park!",
          "Absolutley spectacular. Beautiful picturesque scenary. Tough single lane to get to ot, but well worth the drive!",
          "Good times to go - early morning or about 5pm when there\u2019s fewer people. Unusual landscape and fun to explore...",
          "Simply amazing. It leaves you speechless. I loved the view.",
          "Beautiful but viewed it from up the hill away from the grockles. Last time I visited there were those daft, supposedly arty piles of stones everywhere which spoilt it for me. I wanted to kick them all over (seems I'm not the only one to feel like this).",
          "Amazing greenery. Parking space can be tricky.",
          "Absolutely magical place. My favorite spot in Isle of Skye. Don't miss it.",
          "Amazing.  But don't go, too many people will ruin it :)",
          "Really cool and unique place. Worth the stop.  Very easy to get to. Feels like a different world",
          "Beautiful place. Kids loved it. Not much parking. Very small road to travel on, but worth it.",
          "Wear proper climbing shoes. There is an easy and a hard side to climb.",
          "Quite cute, and make sure you go in the evening to avoid the crowds.",
          "Beautiful outing for the whole family. It is easy to find as well as very accessible. Most of the site could be accessed with a terrain wheel chair if need be (like the light weight three-wheeler). The part (probably) not possible to access in this way would be the very top of the glen (the labyrinth).",
          "Such a magical place. Tucked away from the main road into Uig but well worth a visit! A collection of hills and mounds which look like a mini highlands and in the centre a big rock which is known as the fairies castle",
          "not as easy to get to certain points as they would have you believe, but still overall a beatiful transfixing spot not to be missed.",
          "A very small walk to the top but very nice place to just sit and relax.",
          "It was 'different', but we did not find it very special. When you are around, you can certainly have a look, but I wouldn't drive the extra miles just to see this.",
          "This place is magical. The terrain is captivating. You can wonder in any direction and most likely be hit with a big, fresh, cool gust of wind and meander through mazes of fern bushes and rock formations. And see some sheep and their little tufts of will caught on the tall grass. It's beautiful and scerene. Love.",
          "Gorgeous hills that were easy enough to climb. I recommend leaving the car in Uig if you can walk the extra miles... Seems like there wasn't a lot of parking places closer to the fairy glen itself.",
          "So cool! Hard to describe, climb up for the full effect",
          "Get there early for best views and experience - beat the crowd.",
          "Beautiful place, make sure to come early morning so you can enjoy a quiet atmosphere!",
          "We didn't get to see much due to the foggy weather, but from what I've seen online, it's a beautiful spot with good views.",
          "Very nice and peaceful place with a magical-mystical atmosphere. The grass is very nice and smooth, the sheep take a good care of it. The trails are very nice.",
          "The Fairy Glen is definitely worth a visit if you are on Skye. The unusual landscape is really interesting to walk over and offers a unique experience. You can also drive through it, but I would recommend stopping and having a walk around \u2026",
          "Great views and rock formations but parking is horrible. Be prepared to bring hiking boots.",
          "Visited Feb 2019, we were the only people there. Amazing place, good scrambles and fantastic views. Can be terribly busy in summer so a winter visit is probably best.",
          "Could be a fantastic place, but is way too busy to create a magical atmosphere. Recommend to go early or off season!",
          "One of the most magical place that i have ever visited. It was the last day of our trip when we struck here.... Small hills and green everywhere, large waterfalls on the horizon. Parking could get a issue here...",
          "Very nice place, but no parking space around",
          "Beautiful place! 1-2 hours should be enough time to explore the area",
          "Beautiful place especially with the sunset",
          "Absolutely stunning. Could spend all day there. Was my favourite place in the Skye. Would be amazing for kids so many little walks. Highly recommend. Get up early as well! We had the whole place to ourselves",
          "This place is heavenly. I can\u2019t say enough good things. It is just breathtaking. There is a small hike to get up to the glen so be prepared, however it is so worth it. Great scenes for pictures and amazing views. I would make it a must see when you are on Isle of Skye!!",
          "Exelent but to many peoples",
          "Lovely unusual scenery, but bloody busy when we went at the end of July (which we expected)",
          "Honestly, I can't understand why people give this place such a high rating? There are no amenities, no parking (and where you could theoretically park your car, you aren't allowed due to private properties) and there is basically nothing to \u2026",
          "Wear rain full gear, weather shifts in minutes. Not a strenuous walk, short climb with the ascent to the very top using all fours. Beautiful, a bit of magic here.  Note that this is a natural formation, not a ruin of a castle (Ewen).",
          "What a weird and magical place! It reminds me about the Teletubbies \ud83d\ude02",
          "Not that fairy, due to hot weather and dry grass.",
          "Parking can be awkward. It's always busy. Other than that it's a great place for a walk.",
          "Unbelievable! Trees, grass, sheep, rocks - like in any other part of Skye. Yet, different. Magical.",
          "Wonderfull place. It looks like the pardise when you climb and watch from top of  hills. Easy to access and walk.",
          "What a magical place. We had a blast hiking through Fairy Glen, climbing the castle, traversing the fairy rings, and looking for hidden fairy doors. The landscape is breathtaking, the hiking is relatively easy, a 3 and 5 year old had no \u2026",
          "Beautiful, magical & filled with wee fairy homes!",
          "Really cute place, il in any weather \ud83d\udc95",
          "Definitely beyond what was expected. Wind was strong so not recommended for visitors with children but it's fun for adults.",
          "Magnificent place, amazing view from the hiss in the centre",
          "Magical place well worth the visit. You could easily believe there's a fairy just around that hill....\n\nJust make sure you take the right turning and end up on the right side of the valley otherwise you'll be looking at it from a way off and there's no connection road.",
          "Amazing place. Totally looks like Hobbit Shire from Lord of The Rings.",
          "We went in March and it has been raining a lot, so it was super muddy to get around but worth the walk",
          "One of the most beautiful places on earth! You will need proper hiking shoes, a camera, and clothing to suit the weather. Small car park. If you can't go anywhere else in Skye you must go here!",
          "A fine stop. Skye offers nicer sights though.",
          "Magical atmosphere. Probably even more beatiful when it is rainy.",
          "Took my misses there at sunrise and asked her to be my wife. Thanks to the fairies, she agreed!",
          "A must stop, stop here. It's so beautiful and you'll bask in the beauty. My advice which is the same as local advice, go early, sunrise if you can. Rain or shine you'll love it. It's a very brief hike from where you park off the road. \u2026",
          "Soooo cool! There are so many rocks and circles to look at. The sheep that live up there are also not very afraid of you so you can watch them at a comfortable distance. There\u2019s also a big rock that is climbable where you can view the \u2026",
          "Id go again. Lots of fun!",
          "Picturesque landscapes. Very nice place to visit and take some stunning photos. Seen people camp here as there are flat spots for tents with good grass. We enjoyed it a lot and would recommend to all.",
          "Place to visit to see - cute place -",
          "Lovely glen with wild rocks and lovely small walks.The green landscape is something else!!A must-see place in the northern part of Skye. Only a few minutes' drive from Uig. It can get extremely busy during weekends and summer , and parking \u2026",
          "Whoop... It's lovely and ya beware there are 2 ways to go up... One a mild normal walk which is hidden and behind, the other one sooo steep that I lost my phone twice and damn lucky to recover it back... Hehe... Enjoyyy",
          "Stunning!! \nroad not suitable for large vehicles though",
          "Poorly sign posted but beautiful. Our favorite spot on all of Skye. Be sure to look at the views on each side of the road. Great views of hills on one side, amazing stone structures and rock circle formations on the other. Unique to other spots on Skye and not too busy with people adding to it\u2019s magical feel.",
          "Great place, go early as loads of people there and road narrow.",
          "An absolutely magical place. Try to come at sunset when the light is softer. This would also help you find a parking place as the room is limited and there are tons of tourists during the day. Take your time and don't hurry around - the place does feel better if you take it in at a slow pace.",
          "Beautiful place but people are not guided and often don't care about it. Only few parking slots available.",
          "Beautiful. I can't wait to visit again.",
          "It's just beautiful.",
          "I want to go back! I wasn't able to see it all in the hour and a half I was there but what I did see was AMAZING! I walked from the Cowshed hostal (which I heartily recommend) and the journey was incredible. I would definitely recommend it, even if you think you're not into nature! P. S. Wear good shoes!",
          "Pretty cool place! Up there with the things to see",
          "Lovely surroundings and panoramic views.",
          "One of the great Skye Place to visit.\nAlso one of theajor Game of Thrones Shooting Location:)\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0e",
          "Beautiful landscape! It is worth climbing on the small rock that dominates the valley!\nIt's fairly crowded so try to come early or late in the day if you are planning to find some parking",
          "What a strange quirky little place. Enjoyable enough little place to visit.",
          "Magical place... Worth a visit",
          "I'm sure if you can visit without a coach or two full of people there at the same time, it'd be really quite magical! All the same, there are plenty of hills to climb to get away from the crowds. It's definitely a beautiful place.",
          "Once the folks flying drones buggered off it was an incredibly serene and magical stop. Worth visiting for sure. Bonus points if you roam the hills and find the sheep bones/skulls in the stream.",
          "By far one of the most picturesque visits we made while on Skye. Waterfalls, hills, and sheep make for stunning views of the surrounding landscape. We spent only about 25 minutes here climbing rocks and taking pictures, but I think you \u2026",
          "Must visit!! The view is breathtaking.",
          "A magical place to visit. Just nature",
          "Beautiful area ruined by heavy over-tourism unfortunately. Still a good view of the glacial area on some of the hills if you're willing to do the small hike.\nWe were told by a local that was with us at the glen that the standing stones, \u2026",
          "One of the most beautiful and serene places I've ever been to.",
          "Absolutely loved this calm and serene place that pops out from the middle of what seems like nowhere",
          "The Fairy Glen is a beautiful corner of Skye that used to be untouched and unspoilt. It is still a beautiful place to explore and stare at in wonder but it's popularity is starting to spoil it. \nPlease do not leave \"offerings\" for the \u2026",
          "Beautiful place and nature. Good for walks, little difficult because of the climbs and rocks. \nBut really worth it if you are fond of nature. Surely recommended!",
          "Beautiful area, lots of hills & glens, all simply stunning. But do beware of the narrow single track down there it's not good at all, especially when busy. No real parking either!",
          "Amazing place - just a natural spot with no signs or explanation. Magical",
          "Calculate enough time to climb on the hills and overlook the stunning landscape.",
          "Lovely green hilly quirky place",
          "A little summary of Skye: mini-glens, green and neat grounds, mini-loch",
          "Fairy tale place ...",
          "Make sure you take some time to wander and explore the area fully - we did it at a leisurely pace in 1h. Fascinating landscape, cool man-made stone garden area, and a great view from the \"castle\"",
          "Very nice place to visit. We really recommend it to visit. Its like your in the set of lord of the rings/hobbits. Even with kids its nice to visit. You can have an easy walk.",
          "Beautiful area, so green! The small hills could be mistaken for barrows, but no records suggest this.",
          "Great place to see. Really beautiful on the nice day",
          "It is amazing. The hobbits have a second home here.  It looks like it comes direct from the Lord of the Rings.\n\nIt is far of the main road and there is no clear sign. Also parking is challenging. \n\nA must see if you are passing by to Uig.",
          "This is small, but really scenic area. Also this place in top - 10 of any Skye guide books.  Number of visitors just insane, parking almost doesn't exist, road is super narrow. So, this is awesome place, but expect to share it.",
          "So. Freaking. Magical. I've never been anywhere like it. Super atmospheric and a blast to romp around and clamber over.",
          "Must see!",
          "You have to go there. Rally beautiful!!",
          "It was windy, it was rainy and it was amazing. If you want to take a shorter hike followe the road all the way to the jutting rock. We made the mistake of parking at the very beginning of the fairy glens and it was about a 45 minute hike. We only fell once so that was a good thing. :)",
          "The long walk to the pools--even in bad weather--is well worth it, possibly because of the soothing sound of the stream along the way.",
          "Amazing. \nKids will love exploring. Some high hills.\n Very pretty though. Bring your gumboots if its rained",
          "Such a unique place. We visited it as part of a bus tour on a Sunday, as public buses weren't running. It wasn't busy at all (August), and it truly did feel a bit magical. If you can, get yourself a tour guide to tell you of the myths and stories that go along with the Glen!",
          "Amazing views",
          "Beautiful location and worth a visit, unfortunately tourist have ruined a lot of it, it's a shame. If taking dogs be careful, there are free roaming sheep.",
          "Way to this place is, as usually in this part of Scotland, difficult due to narrow roads. Sadly, there is no parking place. The main attraction is 3 minute walk uphill from the pond. Once you reach this place, you can meet druidic rings, \u2026",
          "Not easy to find but really worth it. Nice valley with a cool atmosphere from Lords of the ring or other fairytale movies.",
          "Beautiful & peaceful place \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Love this place.  It feels magical. I can see why everyone comes here. The natural topography and the human design make you feel like you are in an episode of outlander or a scene from Game of Thrones.  Getting here is not super easy. It is \u2026",
          "Wonderful place to lose some time hiking about",
          "Probably the busiest place we visited on Skye. Not entirely sure why. Although an attractive short walk the manmade 'fairy' features are not that impressive and parking is terrible. Not sure I would bother in future.",
          "A bit crowded at the best parts, but if you go off the beaten path, it\u2019s full of rabbits and other wonders!",
          "Magic place, circle in the ground like circles after a tear on a water",
          "Interesting site worth a visit if passing through Uig. The road to the site does not allow tour buses and other large vehicles. I suspect the site was an ancient castle or settlement, it has a similar layout to Sarsen in some respects. Hills that have been 'tamed' for agriculture.",
          "Beautiful place. Worth talking a walk (and climb). You can get some excellent photos from this place. Just mind the step as you climb some of the rocks; it's a long way down on either side of the path sometimes.",
          "Very beautiful place and a nice walk.",
          "Very cute place. If you have time and are up for a little walking, stop by.",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Definitely take a hike up and see all the beauty! Just be respectful and don't build your own junk up there!",
          "Beautiful but no services.",
          "Visiting Scotland n not visiting fairies.. Naah... \nNot possible.. Fairy houses and fairy swimming pool.. How can u not visit.. Just have to believe.. N imagine... The views are really nice..",
          "Definitely go and see this if you are in Skye but be warned that in peak season parking is hard to come by. I would recommend parking at a small graveyard close by.",
          "Great view points. Very cute and mystical.",
          "Four walls surrounded by a marsh",
          "Very mystical and unusual landscape and nice hills to walk up for views across the whole fairy glen. It can be a very busy single-track road leading to it, causing delays by waiting for cars to pass, but worth the wait!",
          "Lovely place to have a little walk up the hills and round fairy glen! Definitely worth it for the views",
          "Enchanting little place to photo and stroll around. Best to park further up the road and walk down as the paying carpark is very busy and can get muddy if the weather's not fine.",
          "Magical sport especially for the kids",
          "Nice, calming surroundings",
          "Cool place. Need water tight shoes. Walking stick highly  recommended. Its very muddy! Make sure to walk to the southwest about 50 feet. People have gathered up stones and made some neat arrangements.",
          "A must visit! Sheep roamed around while we searched for fairies. The landscape was just fascinating! You can climb high up to the top and explore the hills and valleys. Be kind to nature and leave no trace.",
          "Amazing place, went around 5pm on a sunny day, not crowded at all. There was trash in the middle of the fairy ring which is very sad. I would still recommend it to anyone who likes outdoors. Suitable for kids too, except the little Rock hill, which is really steep and has no barriers whatsoever.",
          "Fun place to explore.",
          "A beautiful place to walk about and enjoy Skye!",
          "Beautiful landscape almost like taken from a movie.\nLike nothing I've seen before!\nWell worth spending some time walking around and enjoy this magnificent place.\n\nNo signs at the main road, but you arrive there by a road next to Uig Hotel.",
          "Like all the other places around Isle of Skye, this is also a must if you are traveling around the area. I was told it was just a short viewpoint, but actually there is a nice walk around the place. You can go up a few of the hills, and the \u2026",
          "We have camped at the bottom of the rock. Amazing place",
          "Amazingly beautiful views",
          "The way up is a bit slippy but totally worth it! It looks as magical as the name implies",
          "Magical, even if a bit crowded.",
          "Our favorie place. Its magical.",
          "Beautiful. :)",
          "Beautiful place like in a fairy tale",
          "Amazing place... Camped overnight listening to the fairies dancing. Magical",
          "An absolutely amazing, must see spot! But it\u2019s become overrun. Just like many ancient landscapes in Skye.\n\nThankfully people do respect the land, but good luck getting a photo with nobody in it!",
          "Fun and quick to reach",
          "Amazing place!",
          "Breathtaking,. Def hobbit country",
          "One of the single nicest places, I have ever been to. Hope for poor weather as this will keep other visitors at bay.",
          "A beautiful green glen with typical terraced and a bit pointy hills completed by a fairy castle. It's a bit busy, so try to visit early or relatively late. And it can be a bit slippery too, so watch out when climbing the 'castle'. It's free to visit.",
          "Stunning but very busy.",
          "Beautiful place to visit",
          "Family of 4, two girls 16 and 6.  The little one was loving all of the Isle of Skye. The 16 year old was nearly a disaster because of the bad weather when we were there, but she got out of the car for this location. The Fairy Glen was her favorite experience in all of England Scotland and Wales combined.",
          "Very nice natural beauty",
          "It is like smaller Quiraing. Beautiful nature.",
          "Beautiful! Super windy. So fun.",
          "Magical!",
          "Place where you must to go when you will be on isle of Skye",
          "Such an extraordinary landscape! Amazing view and fresh air. Summer is the best season for a visit!",
          "Do not miss this stop! Amazing, easy hiking around beautiful landscapes. Waterfalls in the distance. Sheep everywhere.",
          "Absolutely beautiful place, the road in is very narrow but has passing places. We visited around 10am (in middle of August) and it was already very busy, hard to find a place to park. Once parked up you can wonder in any direction as there \u2026",
          "Was raining but small hills to look around, careful if goovling pictures the rock stacks have been taken down but still worth a visit.",
          "Even more enjoyable of you're willing to brave a cold, cloudy day... makes you feel like the fairies are watching \ud83d\ude04 I'd recommend visiting later or earlier on in the day to avoid most of the crowds.",
          "Really lovely place to visit. Limited parking available but all worth it.",
          "Didn't see a fairy but hop to see one someday. Though did believe it to be a fairy land.  Such calm and clean with no sound. Even if a fairy just touched me and disapperead would never know",
          "Really cool place",
          "I can imagine it was once very nice. I feel like people have ruined a lot of what this place used to hold in beauty. The fairy spiral had been overdone and people leave a lot of garbage in it. The tour buses aren't supposed to be allowed back on that road but they go that way anyway overcrowding the place.",
          "Images dont do it justice...Just as magical when visit even in december/ January!",
          "A place just out of that fairytale book. Perfect and blissful. Good for family hiking.",
          "Untouched beauty",
          "Outstanding",
          "So gorgeous!!! Literally transported to a fairy tale. Bring hiking shoes as the hills are muddy and enjoy the mountains!",
          "An absolute must see on Skye. The landscape dues indeed look fey especially nice on a sunny day.",
          "Easy to hike nice view",
          "Best place to visit in Isle of Skye. I found it even better than Old Man of Storr. The landscape is Greeen and beautiful with many hills you can climb. Good photo ops for landscape enthusiasts. Parking is scarce so go early. Even photos \u2026",
          "Lovely stuff",
          "A lovely peaceful location with some great views. Not particularly authentic, but worth a visit if the weather is nice and you are in the area.",
          "Good place for picnics.",
          "Amazing place. If you don't believe in fairys you will after visiting here. Can be really busy at times and the road is very narrow with not a lot of passing places",
          "Awesome place",
          "I loved this place. A small, magical location, filled with small but steep hills with rings etched into them by the sheep, and mysterious stone circles and piles that have obviously been placed by visitors, but still cause you to get swept \u2026",
          "Lovely place to walk",
          "Stunning views!",
          "Very pretty but we expected more. The view is nice, but it's small and very touristic",
          "Beautiful and enchanting",
          "Gorgeous place. An easy little hike. Only downside is the droves of tourists (of which I was one). Will hopefully stay magical and nice. Would hate to see someone capitalize on this for monetary gain.",
          "Fantastic place! Can be crowdy. Not much parking spaces around, best go early morning:)",
          "Don't go... we Love the place to ourselves. Seriously it is amazing. Take good out door shoes wellies etc.",
          "Beautiful place, many tourists, but worth seeing. We were 2hours on the ground. \nIt is also a good place for taking pictures.",
          "Extremely beautiful place!",
          "Best stop of my tour of the day.  Hiked to a fairy pool (s) where I dipped in.  Was a great experience.",

          "This place was an wonderland- it certainly felt like a home for fairies. However, I worry that without some sort of protection, it will be lost to the masses! People had trampled all over the place, visibly turning this lush green landscape \u2026",
          "it was very pretty and has tons of walking trails.  There are areas where you can park for free. There is a steam and a pond too.  many good vantage points for photos.  good hour of your time. ",
          "What a magical place!",
          "Beautiful location that we managed to see on a gorgeous sunny day. The trail is not arduous and is suitable for all ages. I would advise wearing appropriate footwear (we saw some people in heeled fashion boots) as the path is rocky and may \u2026",
          "We got attacked by midges opening the car door, but a spritz of Smidge and a quick dash across the road left them behind.  Not a long or difficult hike. A chain of very pretty little waterfalls - kind of like someone went overboard on a landscape waterfall system.  None of our pictures did it justice.",
          "This place looks exactly like a fairy tale. You should definitely visit it!",

Like most of Sleat, but unlike most of Skye, the area is fairly fertile, and though there are hills, most do not reach a great height. It looks out over the Sound of Sleat, to Morar and Mallaig.\n\nThe name \u2019Armadale\u2019, meaning \u2018elongated valley\u2019, derives from the Old Norse armr and dalr.Clan Donald has a visitor centre situated next to the ruins of Armadale Castle and surrounded by large gardens, while the nearby Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig is a centre of Gaelic learning.\n\nThe village is also a small port, and has a regular Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service to Mallaig. It is at the southern end of the A851 road.\nWhen walking on the beach near the pier, it is possible to see otters and seals.\n\n\n== Ferry service ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Clan Donald Visitor Centre and Museum of the Isles, Armadale",

          "Our tour group stopped here for about 1.5 hours before boarding the ferry. That gave us time to walk up to the ruins and take some great photos of it and the view from there. Then, we had time to go through the lovely gardens and visit the museum. Be sure to wander in the",
          "This place is so worth visiting. The castle ruins are interesting and the views across the Sound of Sleat are spectacular. Gardens are lovely with many very old trees. The museum is really interesting ans we were fortunate to talk to ine of the staff who was an expert in Gaelic.",
          "We were staying near Kyle of Lochalsh and having only arrived the day before decided to check out Skye. Armadale was the nearest castle so we drove there for an afternoon out. Only to find that out of season it\u2019s SHUT at weekends! How ridiculous?!",
          "Castle ruin is just one of many but the gardens are good to walk around and the museum is very interesting. Well worth doing. Has audio tour which gives further information. The history of the Celt\u2019s is explained as is early scots and the clan Donald. Spend a couple of hours it",

          "We visited Armadale on a sunny afternoon and spent 3 hours wandering around. the museum took up some time and was very educational. The grounds were good for walks and viewpoints and the old building very picturesque. We did the woodland walk. All in all value for money",

          "This castle is basically a facade now, but unlike other castle ruins, you aren't allowed in to explore because of the instability of the structure. The gardens are also much smaller than most of the other castles with gardens. If you are coming in from the Armadale Ferry, then",

Some nice short walks and a museum. We particularly enjoyed the view over to the ferry that we\u2019d just",

          "The ruins of the old castle are fenced off so we couldn't explore easily, but they were quite pretty to look at. There are some lovely woodland walks in the grounds as well, with good views over the bay as well. The museum is wonderful to wander through and explore, and",

Built pre-1800\u2019s ... it was abandoned in 1930\u2019s & then partially demolished in the 1980\u2019s! I\u2019m disgusted at the lack of effort to restore this property. As a property",
          "\u00a38.50 basically to walk my dog!!!! Why they can't admit you to the gardens for free and then just pay for the museum if you want to go to that I don't know. Couldn't get into museam as no dogs allowed. Really think this place needs to rethink its set up. Very disappointing",
          "The audio guide in the museum is fantastic and makes the experience much more informative. The castle grounds are beautiful and we would definitely recommend walking to the edge to look at the views over the sea. The staff were lovely as well \ud83d\ude0a",

          "The Castle was a little disappointing as it is cordoned off for safety reasons. however the gardens and museum proved to be most interesting. We did not have time to go on the woodland trails. Nice restaurant where we enjoyed some lovely scones and a cup of tea.",
          "I popped in here to kill a couple of hours before my visit to Eilean Donan and I was no disappointed. I was allowed to take my dog in and wasn't charged extra, the castle ruins themselves were in great condition and worth seeing but the gardens are awesome and worth a visit to",
          "If you are coming here to visit a Scottish castle then you will be disappointed. Even the pictures on the literature (and above) make you think there is a castle here but it is a shell and you can\u2019t get near to it. That said the grounds are quite nice and there is a museum",
          "The grounds are nicely taken care of and there are beautiful views but you can not enter the castle ruins, which are pretty small. This is a nice place to stop along the way to catch the ferry but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily detour here when there are so many other amazing things to",

          "Well worth the \u00a38.50 ticket price. The museum was interesting and the grounds are very attractive. The castle is a cracking building and it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s a ruin. Cafe was closed at 3.30pm on a Saturday, but probably too hot for tea anyway!",
          "My wife and I got off the ferry and went here first to start our week stay in Skye. I definitely enjoyed the museum which had an abundance of information about not just the castle but the history of Scotland, Skye, and the MacDonalds. Along with the museum, the grounds have a",

          "Don't waste your time coming here as the castle is all ruins that is ropped off and tons of weeds. Waste of time and money. They do have a museum that is quite nice and informative. The entrance fee includes the ruined castle, museum, gardens (that are just okay) and an audio",
          "I agree with someone else, you can't get close to the castle ruins, I think it's rather expensive just to see the ruins, the gardens are beautiful though so we did take a few photo's. Yes the gift shop is limited nothing special really to buy,",

          "The castle and gardens are fantastic. Good views of the ocean/bay. You can experience what castle life must have been like hundreds of years ago. Also the castle is updated so you can see what a family living here now experiences. The tour was very good too. Make it a stop on",
          "This was a lovely visit but we got there at 3.30pm with it closing at 5.30pm. We knew our young children would have limited interest in the museum which was made more enjoyable by the lovely lady at the museum desk who made our son very enthusiastic about finding the monkeys!",
          "For the ticket price you get access to the castle, gardens and museum. While the museum is very interesting and worth a visit it only takes an hour to go round and we would say it is the main part of the visit unless it is sunny and you can enjoy the gardens. It was raining",
          "The Museum at Armadale Castle is really fascinating. Lots of Scottish history plus an area about some of the people who left Scotland to go to America in very cramped conditions.The staff are very helpful in the library if you want to do some family research.There is also a well",
          "We didn't have this on our to-do list and stumbled upon it completely by accident while on our way to the ferry. We loved the ruin, and it was surprisingly beautiful. The gardens are immaculately kept, and the museum was a major highlight. Hopefully we'll have a chance to return",

          "took our visitors for a trip out . The weather was not on our side. The cost of entry is pretty steep for 5 adults and although the grounds are beautiful to walk round and the museum is nice , it seems to have become a bit of a tourist trap . The food in the restaurant was poor",
          "Stopped here as we had time, very much worth the (minimum effort required!!). Interesting story of the castle and magnificent gardens. Trees identified and short stories of many. Great for a Southern Hemisphere visitor!! We were there in the high tourist season but few others",
          "Stopped here for lunch on a tour. Did not visit anything other than the gift shop and the cafe. Fee is charged for the castle. Gift shop had some interesting items. Food was very good, especially the venison",

          "Stunning, wide garden; remains of a castle that must have been amazing (and that got wasted in quite a short time) and interesting museum, that tells you about the MacDonald family, but through them you get to know the set of rules, the culture and the habits of ancient times.",
          "This is an elegant castle ruin. The walls are still standing but the castle itself burned down in the 1800s. There is also a museum on the premises that provides history on the Lord of the Isles.",
          "The now ruined mansion built in 1790 was a home of the Macdonalds and there are some good little walks about the gardens to be had. Those travelers that are on the Scottish clans history trail should stop by Armadale Castle, Gardens & Museum of the Isles because it is definitely",
          "Lovely remains of what must have been a fabulous castle. The gardens are lovely and well laid out. The museum in particular was excellent for tourists with audio guides in several languages. very well designed and not boring as some can be. The tearoom was fab too, lovely food",

          "I visit here on a regular basis for information on the history of Isles and to walk through 40 acres of woodland gardens. Stunning views from the ruined castles over to the Mainland. I cannot say enough about great place that been preserved of history.",
          "We visited Armadale Castle in spring 2016 during a holiday and enjoyed it so much we went back again in 2017. Armadale Castle and the Museum of the Isles is an excellent example of what can be done when some imagination and enthusiasm is applied. The castle ruins, the gardens",
          "Had an excellent visit to the Castle ruins and museum. The grounds are fantastic and well kept with a large play area for kids and plenty of walks and viewpoints across the water. If you are lucky, as we were, you can spot sea otters swimming along the shoreline. The museum",
          "Armadale is simply lovely and a \"must see\" (and walk!) for a visit to Skye! The museum is small but informative and engaging, and the staff in the archive library room (make a reservation for this) is patient and helpful. The castle ruins are lovely and the water-side location",
          "This was a highlight of our holiday; very well kept grounds and the museum was curated in an engaging way with lots of beutiful things to see",
          "A family trip to the Clan Donald castle for a plaque dedication ceremony honoring our father and grandfather was what caused us to plan the trip. We had expectations of a good time and our experience far exceeded our expectations. The museum is fantastic and worth a visit",
          "Originally, I thought that we wouldn't have time to stop on our way and get to our accommodations further north... So very glad I was wrong! It was a little wet that day (typical weather I am sure) but it didn't take away from the experience at all. Staff are very friendly and",
          "The castle grounds are beautiful. The place is well maintained. Leisure walk through the gardens, forests and pathways is a must. The flora and fauna needs special attention when walking through. Will cherish the walk.",
          "We opted to run down the road to check out the castle. Have a friend who's related to the Clan. Amazing to see how fast a place can go to ruins. Great place to go if you're into history",
          "Beautiful place with stunning views . Especially with the autumn colours. Found all the staff friendly and helpful. We called into the restaurant and enjoyed a wonderful hot chocolate. The castle is a ruin yet still interesting.",
          "My husband's family is Clan Donald, although unsure if his ancestors are from Skye or elsewhere in Scotland. While in Skye we absolutely had to stop at the Clan Donald stronghold. The ruins of Armadale Castle are very picturesque and the grounds are lovely, but the museum was",
          "We went to this site because my children have traced their ancestry to clan MacDonald. Everyone there was super helpful, particularly the woman in the research library. The museum was very informative, and the grounds and ruins were beautiful.",
          "The Armadale Castle may be in ruins, but there are plenty of great walking trails and beautiful gardens to enjoy. There is also a small Museum that will provide you with the History of Clan MacDonald. We brought lunch and had a great picnic.",
          "The castle is in ruins, but the trees, flowers and plants in the gardens area amazing. The Museum of the Isles is a good overview of the history, the battles and life on the Isle of Skye as well as the Western Isles. There are so many artifacts including swords, targes,",
          "We found that the Clan Donald Skye and The Museum of the Isles was OK but not an attraction to travel out of the way for. The only part that held our attention was the history behind Clan Donald.",
          "We absolutely loved the Isle of Skye and so wished that we could spend more time there. I could come back and just stay there for a week. It was raining pretty hard that day but since we wouldn't be back for who knows how long, we put on our rain jackets hoods and headed out",
          "the castle is all in ruins but most of the interior is clearly visible from the outside. The walk around the grounds and the view were very pleasant.",
          "We spent parts of 3 days at the Clan Donald Center. The grounds are spectacular, the museum fascinating, and the food wonderful. We became members for a year, which gave us a 20% discount on gifts and food, and was less than the cost of entry for 3 days.",
          "If you want the history of the MacDonalds first hand you should visit this museum. It has beautiful gardens, a ruin and a museum. I was glad I visited and enjoyed the entire visit.",
          "Had been looking forward to visiting as we were staying locally, but I'm afraid we both found it promised more than it delivered. Agreed, the walks can be accessed from the road, but it's the prices in the cafe that really got me. The portion sizes are minute, and I mean minute,",
          "Very informative and well laid out museum detailing the history of theClan Donald, with a free audio guide. The grounds are very pleasant and include the raims of the castle/manor house, though they are cordoned off. I also enjoyed one of their nature trails which had great",
          "The Clan Donald Skye Museum is an interesting display which tells in quite some detail the history of the MacDonald and some other Scottish Clans. There is also a Library on site in which there are many documents available to assist with genealogy research.",
          "We visited on a rather rainy day over in Skye but the grounds remained open for our visit and we had lunch in the cafe on site beforehand. The castle itself is a ruin but the grounds are nice to look round, with lovely scenery along to paths and careful landscaping. There is a",
          "We stopped here mostly to put in time while waiting for the ferry to the mainland. The castle is a ruin that one cannot get too close to, as it is unsafe to do so. The Can Donald Centre was interesting enough for a short visit but not that memorable. I did enjoy the gardens",
          "Unfortunately, it was a cold and wet day when we were able to visit Armadale Castle and Gardens. The gardens were good but we felt they needed a little more tender loving care as a lot of areas were somewhat overgrown with long grass etc. The castle itself was very imposing,",
          "Cost \u00a325 for a family ticket. Museum is an eclectic mix of artefacts but not a lot to hold interest. Castle is an abandoned ruin with no access so you can't look inside very well and very little information is given. Nature walk is actually a public footpath that can be accessed",
          "Could spend a whole day here if the weather is nice - great presentation of history and well-labeled grounds.",
          "Though a bit out of the way on the southern peninsula of the Isle of Skye, this is still a worthwhile journey to see the Museum of the Isles and learn more about the history of Clan Donald and Scotland itself. The ruins of the castle are worth some photos and the location and",
          "We managed to stop here as we were making our way towards Skye. The castle has been recently done up however looks like it is unfortunately running into money problems but the grounds and the place itself is well worth a wander if you've got some time.",
          "A very interesting site with some buildings but the main attraction for us was the beautiful Gardens with excellent views. The Restaurant is extremely good whether you want a snack or a full meal. The Shop also has a good selection of Gifts etc.",
          "I was fascinated to read up on the Donald Clan and hear about all the Canadian connections! The museum and free audio tour is a must-do. The castle with it's sprawling lawns, beautiful gardens and multiple walking paths to explore were great for a group to visit.",
          "The Museum and location are definitely worth the visit but theres not much of the castle left if you are going just for that. The museum has very informative exhibits and they are very well laid out. I feel the highlight for my wife and I though was the nice walkways through the",
          "Nice garden walks, museum for history lovers, nice Arnadale castle photo opportunities. Good views Good take a picnic and stay a while, even archery on the estate. For a fee",
          "Visited here with a friend where we enjoyed a nice lunch - it was a bit pricey but the food was good and nicely presented. The gardens were nice and the visit to the museum was interesting. There was also a wee gift shop. A nice place to visit when exploring the lovely Isle of",
          "Very expensive (\u00a342.50 for five adults. Alarm bells should have rung when the woman selling tickets asked us to make sure we were happy with the price before we committed). You will struggle to find enough to keep you occupied for more than an hour. The castle itself is a small,",
          "Enjoyed my visit to Armadale. The castle ruins were located after a pleasant stroll through the pretty gardens and huge trees that lined the path. The museum was small but informative and the cafe had a number of very tasty hot dishes for sale. Not sure of the entry cost as it",
          "not a lot to see really, the only interesting thing was the museum and the history of the Donald clan",
          "Good wet-day thing to do, pleasant walks and interesting museum (not for the very young), as gets the level of information about right - enough to be relevant, not so much that you don't bother reading any of it. The cafe offered a very good lunch - nothing fancy, but good",
          "We arrived here as thought it would be nice to see. Thought the price of entry for the 3 of us was really expensive. Museum was really small and only took minutes to see, castle was a ruin and you could not really get near it, gardens ok but Skye is beautiful so no need to pay",
          "This is nice place to stop into for an hour or so. I think we paid ~8 GBP to get in. The grounds are lovely with a little garden and wooded walk. Amazingly huge trees (Sequoia\u2019s) and a few monkey puzzle trees. You can no longer walk into the castle ruins. The folks we were",
          "We were on a coach tour and stopped here for lunch and a self guided tour. The castle is just remains, so you don't go inside. However the lush grounds with beautiful ponds and nature trails are lovely. Take the audio phones when you go through the museum, where you'll have the",
          "Been her a couple of times now. The museum is very interesting with many facts about Scottish history. Slightly boring for younger kids so recommend 8+ if you want to get the most experience from it. Shop is nice with touristy items for sale. Cafe has tasty food and staff are",
          "We went to investigate my husband's heritage and possible relation to the Clan MacDonald and were able to talk with a librarian at the museum . She helped look up information on our last name and was so helpful. The museum was not huge but it was interesting. The grounds were",
          "You basically arrive and go for a walk on the grounds. It's nice, but not fascinating. Just paths through lawns. The old castle is just a ruin. You can't go in or explore at all. It looks like they've spent some money on the museum. It's well laid out. We had fun playing",
          "Good place for a walk with lovely drive along the coast to get there and great cafe nearby in town (we didn't eat on site but up the road a bit, there's only one, you'll find it \ud83d\ude09). Museum was informative.",
          "While we enjoyed the castle and grounds we were very very disappointed with the cafe. The restaurant was closed due to a private function. The selection in the very busy cafe was poor. We all chose baked potatoes - they were revolting! Fillings were OK. This meal for 3 cost \u00a330",
          "There are 40 acres of impressive gardens and wonderful woodland walks as well as the museum which spans the 1500 years of history of the Highlands and Islands. The ruins of Armadale Castle were the seat of the Lords of the Isles...you can just imagine it all happening. The",
          "We all loved the gardens, old trees beautiful ponds, irritatingly uneaten hosta collection, and a sadly decaying house. The museum was well laid out and informative. There was a very tame peacock which obligingly posed for photos. Thoroughly enjoyed the walks thought the",
          "Beautiful gardens around the old castle and wonderful walk through the woods and up Armadale hill with great views over the Sound of Sleat to the mainland. Excellent cafe serving good variety of food. Visitor centre very informative with history of the MacDonald clan. Well worth",
          "The castle ruins are inaccessible and not very interesting. Not much of interest in the gardens. Museum informative",
          "Whomsoever decided to build the castle/home here certainly has an eye for a great view, just a damn shame that it has been left to ruin. The castle itself (more of a stately home) is just a shell after the fire, and you can't get close to it as it's in a dangerous condition.",
          "We spent a couple of hours enjoying the walk around the grounds, and the castle itself (whilst it is derelict and you are not able to walk around it) was nice to look at. Plenty of history to take in here.",
          "A whole day trip if you like your history, so well explained and illustrated. The timeline display in the middle of the museum was great especially when using the audio tour.I highly recommend the audio, which gives additional information if you want it. A computer program of",
          "We primarily visited the Cland Donald Centre to see the Castle and the Gardens. The Castle, of course, is a ruin and the day we visited there were large marquees in front of it so we couldn't get the full perspective of the building. The gardens are pretty enough but not",
          "Beautiful gardens. Peaceful setting. A Short drive from the ferry landing and not far from our hotel of choice.",
          "Stopped to have a coffee and a scone and sit outside in the glorious sunshine. Followed directions to the restaurant/coffee shop to what looked like a school canteen . There were 2 almost empty fridges which contained cartons of juice, bottles of water and cans of juice and",
          "Eating in the restaurant while here was a huge mistake!! At 12.29, no baked potatoes ready, scones all sold and quiches on menu also \"not ready\". Sandwiches on offer would not look out of place on a garage forecourt!! White bread, cheap ingredients!! No locally sourced food on",
          "The museum at Armadale is fantastic. Very interesting and very well done. All the people who work at Armadale are very friendly and helpful. I had great help in the Clan Donald Library doing ancestral research.",
          "A lovely garden with views - what's not to like? We didn't bother with the visitor centre which looked a bit intense for us. A house that was left to rot is the ruin in the midst- how wonderful it must have been in it's heyday!",
          "Visited castle and gardens beautifully kept loads of wildlife enjoyed sitting on the bench watching numerous song thrush on the lawn. Also saw spotted fly catchers. Three beautiful ponds with lilies in We walked the red nature trail due to lack of time the hour walk had lovely",
          "Lovely gardens, even on a drizzly day with midges. Plenty of walking trails to try. The ruined castle is a photo opportunity, only viewable from the outside. The museum. Hmmm. It has very few artefacts - what you get is a lot of boards full of writing about Scottish history.",
          "I arrived quite early and found that I had the castle and gardens to myself for a while. Entry is through a very well stocked gift shop, admission price is \u00a38 per person which includes the castle, gardens and museum. The castle itself is a ruin and cannot be entered, there are",
          "This is a nice, peaceful stop, particularly if you have time before catching the ferry to Mallaig. The main house is in ruins but there is a good visitor's center. Our favorite part was the wide variety of trees and shrubs in the gardens.",
          "The grounds and flora are excellent. The castle ruins not so much. Tour buses bring lots of folk. A tent was set up in front of the ruins to cater to the crowd, interfering with any photos.",
          "We were fortunate enough to visit when the Blue Bells, Wild Garlic, and the rhododendron were in full bloom. Although the castle is nothing to write home about, the museum and trails make the Center easily worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful museum full of the history of the Irish and Norse invasion of Western Scotland, and the times of the MacDonald Clan from the days of power to the betrayal at Glencoe, and beyond.",
          "I can see why this museum received awards - it really does an excellent job of not just showcasing the Donald Clan, but Scottish history as well. The Donald house is an interesting set of ruins - you can picture life inside, even though you can't go in yourself. The grounds",
          "You need a few hours for this if you are going to see everything. There is an on site cafe that serves light meals, tea and coffee, so you won't go hungry. The old castle itself is now a ruin and you can't get too close, but it is a site to behold and takes you back to the clan",
          "So, one of the selling points of our clan Gathering was a reconciliation with Clan MacDonald. Originally I had planned to go here in 2014 but after a very daunting day trekking at the fairy pools (and being hit by a sheep) we never made it here. So I was very pleased to have",
          "Spent a wet morning at the centre. Was really interesting learning about the Jacobite cause and generally Scottish history - like the first Scots were actually from Ireland. Had a nice morning coffee here too. Lovely gardens too.",
          "On a wet day we spent a very pleasant couple of hours in this well presented Clan Donald home and museum. The grounds are very pleasant, even in the rain, the tearoom is nice (excellent scones) and the museum very interesting.",
          "Thanks so much to the archivist Sue for all of your help in the amazing archive. I was able to find lots of great information. I enjoyed tea at the Stables and learned a lot at the museum. The museum was particularly impressive and has a free audio tour. The gardens are",
          "We stopped in the week prior to them opening for the season (they were cleaning) and they were so gracious to let us wander and even shop! Just wish I had been more cognizant of Scotland's \"season\"...which doesn't necessarily coincide with springbreak in the states. Going to",
          "The gardens are a pleasant walk, the castle a good photo opportunity and, although we didn't use it, the restaurant/cafe looked very good. The museum is interesting enough whether you are Donald clans-folk or not. There are some good examples of weaponry. A little pricey for its",
          "We did not see this attraction at its best, officially it wasn't even open, but we just walked in, had a look around, and enjoyed the walks. The weather was bad and we had just got off the ferry, yet there are great views here, lots of history, and extensive gardens to explore",
          "The grounds are lovely and the restaurant is very good, but the time it took to get here from the mainland was not worth the trip. The Castle is a shell with only the outside to view. The museum had a few interesting items.",
          "This place is ideal for family visits. The museum exhibits are full of interest and well explained. The garden are relaxing and the children's play area is excellent.",
          "Very informative with excellent displays. Beautiful gardens and lovely woodland walks. Very nice lunch in the cafe.",
          "Well laid out museum very interesting content, lovely gardens too. Very nice cafe before entering the museum, was busy due to coach parties stopping. Overall a good visit",
          "Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's just a facade on top of ruins that you can't explore and the museum is made to look interesting without much substance. Visit the nearby Eilean Donan Castle instead. Definitely a tourist trap.",
          "I visited here with my daughter who is studying Gaelic at the University of Glasgow. We are members of Clan Donald. The grounds are really lovely and peaceful and have easy paths, many paved. The museum has an audio tour in many languages and is interesting. I'm not usually one",
          "Excellent, definitely get the audio tour, as its very informative about life hundreds of years ago. was lovely, staff are very knowledgeable too, so well worth having a chat with them.",
          "The Clan Donald Center at Armadale is a must for history lovers, and gardeners, the grounds are wonderful and diverse and the shell of Armadale Castle sets it off beautifully, there is a great cafe and shop and an excellent museum which will be of particular interest to",
          "Castle is a ruin and not a huge amount to see but the grounds are lovely with lost of paths and trails. Museum is interesting. Definitely well worth a visit and amazing caf\u00e9 at the end.",
          "The museum itself is very well laid out and the long history of Clan Macdonald is divided into different periods of time. Armadale Gardens are stunning. It was a beautiful day when we went and very informative. The gardens are a bit steep, but there are seats for the weary every",
          "Clan Donald Centre is a beautiful site. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. My favorite part of this visit was the ruins of the old castle. The walls remain intact, but the roof and flooring are long gone. There is a sense of melancholy about the entire estate. You",
          "The MacDonald museum was one of the most interesting museums we saw in Scotland. Essentially, the museum offers a history of the Scottish clans through the perspective of the MacDonalds, which at one point led a petty kingdom in the Hebrides. Starting with the history of the",
          "Walking on the path that leads to the castle, you can see many unusual plants in a well-cared-for botanical garden. Take a short walk from the castle to the museum and you encounter many more plants and even a peacock. The history museum explains Scottish history and has many",
          "So much rich history in this place and so sad that only ruins of the castle remain. The museum should not be missed as it provides so much wonderful history!",
          "The museum was very informative about our Scottish heritage. We spent quite a while looking at the exhibits. Well worth the entrance fee. The Castle and grounds were interesting but the museum was well worth the fee.",
          "The garden is very beautiful and the castle is amazing from outside, but unfortunately no one cares for the castle so it is a ruin that is to dangerous to go inside. The museum is not very interesting for people who do not belong to the MacDonalds. Furthermore, the museum seemed",
          "After arriving on the Isle of Skye on the Calmac ferry, we drove just several minutes to the Clan Donald Museum. Well maintained museum with varied displays and lush grounds for walking. Lunch at the tearoom was a fun experience, with the staff with their Scottish accents and",
          "Got to be the first place you visit on the Isle of Skye plenty to see and do and lots of history, it's no wonder the Scots hated the English , great gardens to wonder around and a little gift shop for the odd souvenir and then back to the cafe for a brew ..... \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "at first you see the remaining wall structure of Armadale Castle and having been the first destroyed Castle seen up close, it's rather sad. . . then you turn around & the VIEW is unbelievable!! and you can only imagine it in it's original days with the parties and gatherings",
          "Lovely location, interesting place and friendly staff. Nice restaurant...good quality. Disappointing that advertised attractions such as archery and claypigeon shooting were not available.",
          "The castle is a ruins that is really nice to see. You can get a great photo shot from the back facing the lake. The museum was interesting and the food at the cafeteria was pretty good too.",
          "The facilities are excellent (my friend needed an electric buggy) with a modern restaurant, an interesting museum and lovely grounds to walk around.",
          "The grounds are worth the admission by themselves containing some wonderful trees, areas of architectural interest, ponds and good views as well as plenty of walking. Added to that is a museum full of detail which is well well set out. Great when the weather is closing in!",
          "This a great little centre. We spent most of the day here just exploring and enjoyed a light lunch in the cafe. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "As members of the McDonald clan we considered a visit to this centre a must whilst on the Isle of Skye. The visitor centre provided a fabulous and detailed overview of the colourful and bloody history of the Macdonalds. We only wished that we had been able to buy a book or",
          "We visited this venue as part of a tour group. The grounds are very nice; the castle is essentially a ruins; and the museum gives a good overview of the history of Clan Donald. I would not recommend a special visit, rather I'd say visit if you're already in the area.",
          "This was an interesting visit with pretty gardens, but there isn't anything else to visit after Armadale in that section of the island, so it seemed like a lot of driving. Bring proper hiking shoes so you can go for a long walk afterwards and not spend all day in the car.",
          "Didn't have time to visit castle gardens but visited gift shop and also caf\u00e9. Caf\u00e9 is in converted stables and the d\u00e9cor is very much in keeping with a stately home. Really pleasant views from cafe. Had scones with cream, so glad had cream, scones were hard on outside but",
          "A very interesting castle that provides an excellent tour guide to take you though the historic and well-appointed rooms of the castle.",
          "Second visit here. Although the museum is ok i think the castle and gardens leave a lot to be desired. Not even allowed in castle ruins now as fenced off. Perhaps review slightly biased as we had also been to another Castle with Gardens on Skye (Dunvegan) and all 4 in or party",
          "We enjoyed the museum and the artifacts. It is on the smaller side but then again it's not in a big town. The ruins of the castle are beautiful and the grounds are meticulous. Most of the castles are ruins. The museum had a genealogical center in the library. While mostly",
          "This attraction has a variety of things to see while you are visiting. There is a castle. In ruins but pretty neat. The gardens are really impressive and well maintained. The museum has guided tours and was most enjoyable. Our tour guide, a young man, did a great job and",
          "beautiful grounds to walk around. Not much to see in the castle. Ok museum. Maybe there are other things to do.",
          "The remains of this Castle was completed around 1815 and, sadly burned down in 1855. So. 40 years of history with fabulous site and views. I thought the museum was really light on History (and evidence) and therefore heavy on presentation. Many \"mythical\" stories are put",
          "Don't waste money to see this castle. It is a shell of a castle .The museum has very little in it. Not worth Paying to see.",
          "This is a beautiful location, the gardens a meticulously maintained and the estate walking paths are not challenging. I hope that one day the Armadale Castle is restored to its for former glory as this would turn this estate into an iconic location. The gardens, museum and its",
          "Did the garden and castle tour. Castle is in ruins so you need to use your imagination. But the grounds and gardens were lovely. Everything was in bloom and lots of it. Some parts, as in trees, were very ancient. Nice place to take a stroll in.",
          "When we arrived we were at first a bit disappointed to find the castle is a ruin and we could only visit the gardens, but we spent about 3 hours doing a walk, admiring the gardens and working our way through the very interesting exhibition at the visitor centre. The audio tour",
          "I love the history of all castles and this one didn't let me down. The history of the Clans and the Highlands was very interesting. It had beautiful period furnishings that seemed to make the castle come alive. There is a docent to give you a tour of information and answer",
          "The castle is in ruins so there is not much to see beyond the facade. The gardens and grounds are lovely and we enjoyed our stroll. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to explore the museum, which is probably the most significant part of the visit for those who are",

          "MacDonald museum was so interesting, I could imagine all the history taking place in this area hundreds of years ago.",
          "One of the best displays I have seen so far. If you expect something vaguely boring you will be very surprised. Attractive and very interesting writings about the whole of Scotland and its history, explained in a clear and appealing manner. If you have only one day in the South",
          "Stopped here to see the castle on our tour of the Isle of Skye. The castle ruins are alright but there really is nothing much to see. The gardens behind the castle are a little better than average for a nice easy walk. All in all not much of a tourist stop and if we didn't stop",
          "We visited this place towards the end of the day and it was a good way to finish as it didn't really tie up too much time. The castle ruins were largely disappointing because there is not very much information about it and what remains looks quite modern. There isn't really",

          "Our first stop on Skye was Armadale Castle. This has the potential to be a lovely looking castle, and to a certain extent it is, but when we went there was what looked like the frame for a greenhouse in one part of the castle which kinda ruined the romance a bit. The castle",

          "This is always my first stop in Skye when arriving by ferry from Mallaig. The gardens, including the long hill walk for a Cuillin view, never disappoint. And the cafe is handy for a quick snack. But the poor Armadale Castle, always in ruins but formerly approachable, is in sad",

          "This was a disappointment. The restaurant is very pleasant, (but you don't have to pay to go into that). The museum, although informative, is very dry. We took hand sets so that we could listen rather than read, but there was not a great deal to look at. It would certainly be",

          "The museum and is a long way down Skye but it is worth the trip. We only had an hour there which was not nearly enough to do it justice. It began with a short history of the land from a national perspective which was fascinating. It then went on to deal with the story of Clan",
          "We would not return here. The gardens have a lovely view but the museum is dreadful - too much text, too few artefacts and too much prior knowledge of Scottish history assumed and I am a Scot. Most visitors spent little time in the museum. The museum needs a fundamental overhaul",

          "Very well set out, fascinating display in very pleasant surroundings - there was even a fiddler playing in one of the galleries. A huge amount of information but because of the creative way it is set out it doesn't overwhelm. Lovely gardens too - big old trees.",

          "We visited Clan Donald and the museum (and Armadale Castle) in April 2012 and truly enjoyed the whole experience. The museum was very interesting and encouraged interaction with the children. I was fascinated by how much information/displays/artifacts were on show and found it",

          "As someone who lives here, it constantly puzzles me why one castle with gardens at one end of Skye is deluged with visitors, and another at the other end gets fewer visitors. So, both Dunvegan and Armadale are associated with a particular clan. Both have gardens - but Armadale",

          "In total disagreement with the most recent reviewer here - the Clan Donald Skye & Museum of the Isles was the highlight of our visit to Armadale Castle. The castle ruin and gardens are nice for a quick look, but my husband and I spent nearly 2 hours in this small museum and",
          "The museum was actually the highlight of our visit to Armadale. The castle ruin and surrounding gardens are nice, but definitely not worth the 7.50 entry fee. We looked at the ruin and gardens first - took about 20 minutes and was starting to think we'd been ripped off, but",
          "Just been today and it cost our family of 2 adults and 2 kids \u00a325 to get into the gardens and the museum. I expect you could spend much longer than we did here but in reality that may just be to make you feel better about what you paid to get in. It seems to be on the well",

          "Armadale is significant because it is the modern symbolic home of Clan Donald. It may not be the oldest, most interesting structure in Scotland but it deserves respect because all places of this importance should be cared for and visited.",

          "This is really the FRONT of a castle, and gardens surrounding it; so while I enjoyed it; there's not much to see (other than the photo on Google) of the place.  Mostly you walk around and take in the stunning scenery; and they you go to the gift shop!",

          "Very pretty and just huge",
          "Beautiful gardens and large walking areas in very pretty surrounds.  The castle ruins were a simple front and not overly exciting, but the gardens were excellent, as were the friendly staff in the shop and cafe.  Well worth visiting, and if a MacDonald, perhaps more so.",
          "Beautiful castle grounds. The red nature trail is definitely worth doing.",
          "Amazing location, atmospheric castle and stunning autumn colour in the gardens",

          "lots to see and do here. a must for all visitors to skye.",
          "Bit disappointed that we drove all that way and the castle is actually a ruin. Also currently cannot enter the ruin at the moment as it is unsafe to. Bit overpriced in my opinion for the ruin and gardens. Shame there isn't an option to just pay for the museum.",
          "Worth a visit",
          "Another castle visited, this one is just the remains of it former self but still worth a visit as it also has a small museum, gardens , nature trails , a cafe and a shop. Overall it was a good visit.",

          "Lovely",
          "Castle remains only but grounds and stable restaurant/cafe worth a visit",

          "Found this by chance. So glad we went.  The gardens were lovely and the museum was very good with an extensive collection of exhibits given the size of the building. Definitely worth visiting.",

          "Beautiful gardens, great museum, and the food at there restaurant was delicious",

          "Over priced , poor signage especially on the woodland walk , claimed 1.25 miles  . much much longer very slippery both myself and my wife fell , not recommended.   In reply we both had secure walking shoes on ,  we BOTH fell not just my wife,  me heavily down a bank and had to be pulled out , very unsafe",

          "Very interesting and lovely gardens ",
          "More of a ruined stately home than a castle, but what makes this a five star visit are the semi-wild gardens and beautiful location. Close to the sea at the southernmost point of the Isle of Skye and close to the Armadale-Mallaig ferry, it is very accessible and well worth a visit.",
          "It was Tuesday and closed. Luckily we have been before and know how beautiful it is. Disappointed not being able to see it in it's autumn colours",
          "Beautiful old castle ruins with a breathtaking view of the water.",

          "Beautiful Castle and gardens. Well worth a visit.",
          "This isn't a castle. It is a sorry imitation of a castle built by a rich guy in the mid-19th century. Ditto the \"museum\", which contains no actual artifacts and attempts to impart the history of the area through walls of poorly-written placards. Skip both.",
          "A complete waste of money. We paid a decent amount of money to see a rebuilt facade on top of old ruins. No where on the grounds does it even meantion the word ruins. I believe this is intentional. You can't even explore the structure, as \u2026",
          "Classic  sea  view , ideal  4  photography .",
          "Beautiful gardens, interesting ruins and museum. Stopped off on a 2 day tour of Skye.",
          "Gardens average,  what's left of the 'castle' not worth a special visit.  If going passed the door it is worth an hour or so of your time to visit the information cente,shop and cultural museum.",
          "Had a lovely look around the beautiful grounds with many flowering shrubs.\nIt was a shame that in preparation for a music concert we couldn't get nearer the old castle ruins, but in fairness the entrance fee had been substantially reduced \u2026",
          "Nice gardens. Interesting museum of island life and the history of the people from earliest inhabitants through to modern day. Make sure you follow the exhibits in the right order, it makes a lot more sense then :). The Castle is a bit \u2026",
          "Wonderful!!!!",
          "Very nice and informative. The garden are beautiful. Unfortunately into the castle ruin not possible to go in",
          "Museum is shut at this time of year but the gardens were lovely to look round. The lady manning the gate house was very friendly although she was on grandma duties so had her hands full! You stand in front of what remains of the house and wonder what it must have been like when it was being lived in. Well worth a visit.",
          "Worth the wisit",
          "Lovely estate with historic trees from all around the world. The museum provides a one-hour history of the Macdonalds and isles and the castle ruins are a good backdrop to the sense of past glories. Great timber playground amongst the trees \u2026",
          "Lovely gardens and an interesting museum.",
          "Beautiful gardens and a great museum about the Highlands life, including audioguide. Worth a detour!",
          "Nice, but a bit run down",
          "What a great place. We were lucky enough to have it almost completely to ourselves. All the staff we met were helpful and welcoming. We had a lovely lunch in the coffee shop before embarking on a walk around the gardens and nature trail.",
          "The castle actually isnt that old but it was stil fun to go and see. Strange that a stone structure can degrade that much. I liked the garden and the museum was good.",
          "Lovely",
          "Wonderful historic castle and beautiful gardens.",
          "Nice gardens with a great little play area for the kids to wear them out before walking the gardens.\nPersonally I loved the old trees around the grounds, the river running through the gardens and for sure the 110 year old monkey puzzle tree.\nDid not visit the museum so cannot comment on that part.",
          "Beautiful gardens and runs off the castle. A shame you can't walk inside the castle itself. But on a whole a peaceful place with good vibes.",
          "Only visited the shop but the staff were helpful and knowledgeable.",
          "Great gardens and an interesting museum.",
          "Lovely old castle with good views and walks",
          "Beautiful ruin. Too bad it's inaccessible due to safety concerns at the moment. Stunning garden. There's also a nice museum on the premises. Would absolutely recommend visiting if you're in the area.",
          "The gardens at the castle are very peaceful with beautiful views. The castle only has the walls but even so it is great to look at.",
          "Nice stop just off the ferry. Small museum and quiet gardens.",
          "Amazing wee museum.  Beautiful grounds.  Lots of parking",
          "Beautiful grounds to walk in, even on a rainy day",
          "It\u2019s ok but we paid thinking\u2019s we could walk around the ruins but it\u2019s all blocked of so you can only see it from the outside. It was a little disappointing. There is also a little museum to have a look round. The view is the best part.",
          "So the castle is a ruin that you walk around, and the gardens are pleasant, but it was the museum that won the day. As an adult tge information was layed out well and tge audio guides were interesting and added to tbe experience. I'm pretty sure they had activity stuff for kids to do on there way around too.",
          "Although the castle is a ruin it's very interesting and evocative, and the location is just fabulous.",
          "Lovely",
          "For a ruined castle it seems like a waste to pay 8.50 when the other ruined castles of the island are free and have so much more life and character to them. ",
          "Gardens were lovely, however we thought you were able to visit inside the castle ruins and were not made aware that you couldn't do this prior to purchasing our tickets (I had looked at the website and couldn't see anything obvious relating \u2026",
          "Neat to see but not a destination place for sure.",
          "Really nice grounds, information boards, enjoyed the museum, good parking, well sign posted/easy to find.",
          "Great day out with my daughters, age 9 and 6. Gardens are stunning and the museum was a great place to learn about the clans and the jacobites. Highly recommend this as a family morning or afternoon out.",
          "Wonderful place to visit",
          "Beautiful  gardens and views!",
          "Great place to.visit",
          "Nice open spaces and some wonderful views.",
          "We visited the castle today, beautiful gardens and ruins , (unfortunately closed due to unsafe structure) but very dissaponted to be charged \u00a38-50 each and once we got to the museum we were told no dogs allowed , a very expensive \u201cwalk in \u2026",
          "It was okay. \nIt's about 8-9 # and you see a 19th condemned house made of stone and a museum that is just word boards. There is a garden,\nWe did not go through it. ",
          "Private museum with a lot of interesting information about island history. Reasonably interesting ruins. Good cafeteria.",
          "Service could be better, prices are on the expense side for what you get. Bought tickets for the castle and gardens only to find sign that the structure was unsafe and closed to public.",
          "Beautiful gardens. Ruined castle could not go in as not safe but from the outside you could see it would have been in its day.  The cafe was very elegant and food reasonably priced and varied. Spent about three hours there",
          "Castle ruins not what i expected.The garden walks were very nice.museum very sparce.",
          "Beautiful garden... the castle/home has been gutted and there is limited access ... its fenced off so you cannot explore the ruins.",
          "Nice relaxing garden and museum well worth a visit if in the Sleat area of Skye. The former estate of the Clan McDonald, now run by a charitable Trust which includes a visitor centre and cafe. The castle is a ruin and the gardens date back \u2026"

        "wiki": "The A87 is a major road in the Highland region of Scotland.\nIt runs west from its junction with the A82 road at Invergarry (NH307011), along the north shores of Loch Garry and Loch Cluanie, then down through Glen Shiel and along Loch Duich to Kyle of Lochalsh before crossing the Skye Bridge to Kyleakin, Broadford, and Portree, before terminating at Uig in the north of the Isle of Skye.\nIts total length is 99 miles (159 kilometres); it is a primary route for all of its length.\n\n\n== Settlement and junctions of the A87 ==\nNorthwest - Southeast\n\nUig \u2013 junction with the A855 road\nEarlish\nRomesdal\nEyre\nKensaleyre\nBorve \u2013 junction with the A850 road\nPortree \u2013 second junction with the A855 road\nGlenvarragill\nSligachan \u2013 junction with the A863 road\nSconser\nLuib\nDunan\nBroadford\nHarrapool\njunction with the A851 road\nSkulamas\nUpper Breakish\nSkye Bridge\nKyle of Lochalsh\nBalmacara\nKirkton\nAuchtertyre\u2013 junction with the A890 road\nNostie\nArdelve\nDornie\nInverinate\nAult a' chruinn\nInvershiel\nShiel Bridge\nLoch Cluanie\njunction with the A887 road\nLoch Garry\nInvergarry \u2013 junction with the A82\n\n\n== Historic route ==\n\nThe route of the A87 has changed significantly over the years. Until the 1960s, the road ran along Glen Garry as far as Tomdoun, before heading north over the hills to Glen Loyne, where it crossed Loch Loyne with two bridges. It then headed north west to the Cluanie Inn, where it joined the A887. Loch Loyne was dammed as part of a hydro-electric scheme, which put part of this road underwater. A new road was built further to the east, around Loch Loyne, joining with the A887 at Bun Loyne. The remains of the bridges on Loch Loyne are visible when the level of water in the loch is low.The A87 route used to involve a short ferry crossing over Loch Long at Dornie, but this has since been replaced with a bridge. Nearby, the A87 used to run through the village of Morvich, around an inlet at the end Loch Duich. This has now been bypassed with a causeway and bridge.\nIn 1995 the Skye Bridge replaced the ferry between Kyle of Localsh on the mainland and Kyleakin on the Isle of Skye. Tolls were met with considerable opposition, until removed in December 2004.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We stopped by Sligachan Old Bridge at least once everyday, during our visit at Isle of Skye. It is truly a beautiful Bridge for beautiful views. Experienced strong winds during our walk along the river next to the bridge and soaking in the marvelous views that Sligachan could",

          "The bridge was very impressive for pictures with the dramatic backdrop and the hiking opportunities round about it.",
          "A stunning old bridge with beautiful scenery surrounding it. It can be well seen from the road as you drive past but a stop off is recommended to really appreciate how stunning it is! It is only a short visit place but well worth it. It sits right next to the Sligachan Hotel,",

          "Spectacular views of the Cuillins (and the bridge) here. We parked at the Inn nearby and walked over to the bridge. It really gave one a feel for the beauty of Skye!",
          "Defintely stop by this bridge and look at the scenery - stunning. We were told it was one of the most photographed spots in Scotland. We were not disappointed. If you are near the area then allow a half hour stop to walk over the bridge, look at the monument and take some photos!",
          "This bridge is at the intersection of main roads in Skye. You could miss it if you are intent on following GPS. It\u2019s worth making sure you don\u2019t miss though. The bridge is lovely but it\u2019s the setting that makes it unforgettable. Wander around and see it from different angles.",
          "Following a severe overnight storm, the river was flowing and the clouds lifted, to reveal a great photo opportunity.",
          "Being situated at the base of the Cuillin mountains this is a lovely spot. A lovely place to stretch your legs and take in the view.",
          "While this is an old bridge that is now a walkway this is a great chance to practice your skills in photography. Depending on the time of day you are there will change the light and effect of the photo. Always worth a stop and short walk and the to pop over to Seamus's bar.",
          "A truely beautiful bridge in a beautiful setting. It makes for wonderful photo ops and just shows how well things were built in the past. We actually drove by it the first time without really seeing it because it kind of blends in with the scenery and it just belongs there.",
          "Always beautiful, even or especially with low cloud, very atmospheric. Believe you can get married on the bridge",
          "On our way from Edinburgh to Portree, we stopped here for photos - around 6 pm which was close to sunset. There are a couple of car parks within a very close walking distance - a couple of minutes. If you are in the area, it's worth the stop.",
          "Though no longer in use the bridge is in excellent repair and stands as a testament to those who built it. Great example of the stonework of that era. Worth stopping for, if you are in the area though I wouldn't drive too far out of my way to see it.",
          "We stopped at the hotel for breakfast and then after, a walk around. The views are stunning. Even with the amount of people outside, it still feels calm and peaceful. A stop here is a must!",
          "We were highly fortunate on our visit to Skye in May as it was during a bit of a heatwave and there wasn't any rain to be found for days! You can stay in this area but we opted to stay in Portree and drive around the island. It's a beautiful spot to have a picnic (benches are",
          "We stayed near the bridge, which is why we stopped on our way out of skye. It\u2019s a lovely bridge to look at... not sure I\u2019d go out of my way or drive too far to see it though! But if you\u2019re in the area it\u2019s worth a look.",
          "On your way into Skye this bridge is a must to stop at, it's just off the main road. You can park at the hotel car park opposite for free (though be courteous and go in and grab a coffee!). You could spend an hour here and have a picnic or just stop here for a few seconds to get",
          "Classic Skye view. Just a bridge with the Cuillins in the background, but on a clear day, what a picture! One to frame.",
          "Absolute beautiful to visit. Well worth it just a bit of a nightmare to get to once you have parked up. It is in a very busy junction and people walking have a tendency to walk out onto road.",
          "This was a great stop on our trip through the Isle of Skye. It is beautiful and worth stopping for some pictures and a wee bit of history. Be sure to cross over the bridge and go up on the knoll where they plan to erect statues of the men who made exploring these mountains",
          "An old bridge in a beautiful location by the Red Cuillin. Just a lovely place to stop for awhile. There is a hotel next to the bridge.",
          "This is a lovely little spot for photos, wandering, or dipping your toes into some very cold water. The Black Cuillins form the backdrop for this rocky meandering river. As always in Scotland there is an interesting tale. Here it is about the water having restorative powers.",
          "Fabulous walk up the stream from the bridge, rather than the river to find the waterfall pools and have a dip. DO NOT GET IN if you are not used to cold water. Mid August water temp 13 degrees which I love but could cause some people a bit of a problem ;)",
          "Slig Old Bridge is a fantastic photo opportunity with Sgurr Na Gillean in the background and the River Sigachen flowing beneath it. Get there early though as it gets busy and parking is limited. It\u2019s a great start for walks into the Red Cuillins or more gentle strolls up Glen",
          "Have driven this way every time have visited Skye however I never spotted this bridge before. You feel like you are transported back in time when you look at this and the river into the Glens. Worth a stop especially if you like photography",
          "We stopped here on our drive around Skye. There is a cafe with toilets available. Plenty of party and a great photo stop.",
          "This is a nice setting to stop and have a break for a pint and grub and toilets. Also plenty of photo opportunities from and around the bridge.",
          "This was one of the better experiences we had on the very overcrowded Isle of Skye. The area was lovely to photograph from any number of angles, and there was a nice bar and restaurant nearby.",
          "The old bridge is worth getting out of your car to photograph, it has a stunning backdrop of the Cuillin Hills. No matter what the weather it is a great place to see.",
          "Don\u2019t keep driving.....STOP..... a truly beautiful place to stop and take some photos. Just be patient and the hoards will wander away.",
          "Moody, beautiful and scenic. Don't forget to put your face in the water (according to legend). Great area to just stroll around.",
          "Parking either side and plenty of walks to go on, take care walking on new bridge not much room and on a bend-main road. Camp ground Hotel/Distillery and B&B close by. Some fantastic photo opportunities and story boards all around.",
          "A wonderful old bridge this area of the Isle of Skye is a must visit; an iconic bridge it is also the focal point of tourism and trekking into the mountains. Don\u2019t miss a short or long stop here.",
          "This stone bridge is just outside the Sligachan Hotel on the Isle of Skye. It\u2019s a beautiful place to hike or just sit and enjoy the scenery. It\u2019s a great place to build stone cairns.",
          "If you pass by, take the time to walk around the path and enjoy the views from both sides. Nice pictures to be made of the surroundings.",
          "It\u2019s a great spot to park up, enjoy the loch, river, old arched bridge, mountains all around and the stacked stones. We stacked some but don\u2019t knock down other people\u2019s it\u2019s bad karma!!",
          "If you come to Sligachan for amazing photos, wear good hiking boots. The paths are rocky, but the views are well worth it! The views took my breath away.",
          "A nice stop for some photos, ample parking around and also a pub next door.....so if you are touring isle of Skye with a rental car save this stop for a quick coffee apart for some stunning views and amazing pictures.",
          "This old bridge must be one of the most-photographed spots on Skye, either with the backdrop of the mountains or with them, and the bridge in the foreground. In good weather, you'll get tremendous shots of the mountains at sunset.",
          "Full disclosure: I didn't stop at the Old Bridge. I drove by several times enroute to other places and marveled at how many tourists were in the area. Seemed difficult to get a good picture without a bunch of people in it.",
          "This old bridge appears to be world famous to many walkers. You may hear and think of it being only a bridge but your view would definitely change when viewed. This is not just any old bridge. The old slig is a fantastic photo opportunity. For such a small bridge it captures",
          "A little place to take your breath away..... Stop for 5, maybe 15 minutes... even longer ... to take in this view.. The pristine air, great scenery, tranquil settings can offer you a much needed sojourn on your travels. Just around the corner... stop at the pub... the food is",
          "Well worth stopping of for 15 mins to get some great picture of the water cascading along and under the bridge.",
          "With the sun setting or with moody cloud over the Black Cuillin mountains there is always a photo to be had. No two days are the same and with the pub next door it is a great way to spend an evening.",
          "I came here because there is a geocache nearby, and I go geocaching. There are quite a few bridges like this on Skye but the background to this one is beautiful. I was lucky to see this on a good weather day. Do not miss this photographic opportunity. Parking close by at the",
          "Grand imposing scenery whatever the weather. Great views of the red Cuilins and the snow covered Black Cuilins. Worth the stop",
          "Drive to Skye and stopped here. Great scenery and good sturdy walks! Definitely worth stopping for. Parking available.",
          "A great wee stop off to get some great views. The bridge is picturesque and is worth stopping to see.",
          "The place is very nice with an old beautiful bride and incredible view of the mountains. It was a bit windy so prepare a hat. There is also a river which makes the view even better. You can have a nice walk around , sit on the stone bench and have some rest with amazing view :)",
          "We stopped here twice to photograph the beautiful scenery with the bridge in the foreground. Fabulous views to the Cullins. The nearby pub serves good food too.",
          "Good points - fantastic view point by the side of the main road Bad points - quite a few tourists around sunset",
          "This truly is a great place to stop for a photo op. If you are lucky enough to get a clear day the views towards the Cuillin Mountains is magnificent.",
          "Amazing scenery. What a backdrop, but then you will find it hard to see anything other than amazing scenery on Skye.",
          "Beautiful views of the Cullins great photo opportunity. Also a walk starts here but be careful and take the path on the left.",
          "Sligachan Old Bridge might seem small in the middle of such a scenic island, but it is definitely worth a quick stop to wander about. It is very pretty and it has many legends involving it. Do not forget to dip your face into the water to gain eternal beauty :)",
          "This was a gorgeous area. There's a little walking path near the bridge and a stream running alongside. The bridge is small but beautiful. Definitely stop and take a few pics if you're in the area.",
          "Parking was a problem when we arrived but managed to get somewhere eventually. Got attacked by midges and I mean really attacked, be prepared we have been in Scotland over a week now and this was awful. Very picturesque spot, loads of photo opportunities, well worth the stop.",
          "Sligachan: It is a great place to make the first stop on your trip around Skye!Don't expect it to be a town Its almost only a stopping place with a restaurant and a Caravan Site that's it!No houses at all.This would be a great stop to take in a beautiful view over the Cullin",
          "It is a nice place to see the Cuillins but the bridge itself if not that amazing. I wouldn`t stop there if I weren`t driving by.",
          "Loved the river and more loved the pub especially the variety of scotchs available. Heaps of scotch! Prices per nip were a bit high (about GBP5) but they have a huge variety of some of the more unavailable scotchs eg Glenfarglus in 4 agings of the damn thing!!! Great atmosphere",
          "Yes the bridge is old and has a very picturesque backdrop - that's if you can get all of the people out of the picture! It's a shame really that so many stop and stay on the bridge for so long - stops others from taking a decent picture.",
          "Our trip to Skye was arranged to coincide with our friends wedding at the Sligachan hotel. This area is extremely picturesque and very busy! Bring your Smidge!",
          "We hit this at the right time of the morning on our way to the Fairy Pools. On our way back there were so many people on the bridge you could not get a good photo.",
          "Stand on this bridge and look at the view up to the Cullins that you have seen on a thousand postcards and paintings. You will then realise that it is impossible to capture such a scene in any kind of photograph. Five green dots is not enough for this review. One for the bucket",
          "Great place to admire the beautiful surroundings of the cuillins. You can have a very nice coffee (or even better) one of the finest whiskey's at Slichagan hotel",
          "I was in Sligachan for a weekend. I visited the area because it has connections to my family history. The area has some impressive views of mountains.",
          "We happened upon this bridge, as we passed it everyday to get into Isle of Skye. I think that it is worth a stop to see it, and walk across it. The view of the Cullin mountains behind it are gorgeous!!",
          "The spot is beautiful, as is the bridge however it seemed to be crawling with coach tours and many of the paths around are very boggy.",
          "The bridge is a lovely place to take some pictures if you're stopped near by or just passing by. If you have time, there are a couple trails on the sides of the river. The trail with the river on your right hand side goes for a long ways and it has lovely scenic views. It",
          "The old bridge is pretty cool but the bridge with the view in the back ground is awesome. It's worth the tie to check out for sure.",
          "A great place to stop right on the main road, which I didn't expect. Very pretty with the mountains in the background.",
          "This beautiful, old bridge is a great spot for taking pictures. You'll be amazed by the panoramic views of the Cuillin Hills. Moreover, you can take scenic hikes through the moorlands starting from here. The bridge is particularly lovely in the soft light of the evening sun. And",

          "Wonderful view though every visitor to Skye appeared to be dropped off for their obligatory 5 minute photo opportunity. To mention just a few... Coach passengers en mass...not exactly peaceful with 30 + souls traipsing around! Cars parking/stopping regardless of foot",
          "This was a great Old Bridge at Sligachan and plus it's was a gateway to Cuillin Mountain and Great Waterfall",
          "The campsite was well cared for with very clean toilets / showers. They allow dogs and an open fire.",
          "A lovely old bridge on the way to Dunvegan. We stopped here for photos and to recall the story of the fairy king who gave the famous flag to Clan Macleod. A great setting for this story.",
          "I camped here for a night by the side of the river Amazing night, superb experience with loads of photos for memories Happy flashing tourists arrive with selfish sticks after 8.30 so for an unspoilt view aim to arrive before 8.00 There is an official campsite over the road",
          "There are some wonderful trails and great views all around the bridge. The bridge itself is really pretty and offers great views.",
          "great stop off! beautiful photo opportunity and stunning views. There's alwaysssss lots of people here taking photos so it's not hard to find. you just need to know where you want to pull over. There's a lodge/bar next to the bridge we parked at with toilets. You have to pay",
          "The bridge and the landscape around it are beautiful and worth a stop to stretch your legs and take some pictures! All of Scotland is beautiful and this bridge is no exception!",
          "You can get nice photographs of this bridge in different lights. (Just wait a few minutes! The Skye weather will do the rest ). More interesting if with a guide as they can tell you about the history and water facts.",
          "Good for taking a few snaps of the surrounding mountains. When the clouds come in from the sea, the scene is quite dramatic.",
          "Well worth a visit, especially if you have just eaten opposite. Lovely views and the bridge is very pretty. Great opportunity for some photos.",

          "This is a beautiful stop for photos, fresh air and a short walk. We walked up a path to an area with large flat rocks. People were stacking stacks of rocks on top of the rocks. Interesting.",
          "Not much here. Bridge is interesting. Good place to stop and stretch your legs and have a rest stop.",
          "Beautiful spot for photos right beside Sligachan hotel where coachloads stop every day. Old bridge with views of the Cuillin range",
          "We happened to stumble on this location for a toilet stop at the Sligachan Hotel. This is the junction for roads to Dunvegan, Portree or Broadford. On a beautiful day, this is almost like fairyland, a spot out of the movie set. The sparkling running water over the rocks, with",

          "Although the bridge is old and very nice we actually went for the walk into the cullin, we walked about 7 mile all told on a path made of rocks/ stones so it was a good suitable path, on the walk you cross small streams and of course you are in sheep land so keep your dog on its",
          "Nice place to stop for a picture of the bridge and surrounding hills. Plenty of pubs/restaurants in the same area for a pit stop as well.",
          "The bridge itself is not interesting at all, as old as new one. But the same time Sligachan is the head of beautiful trails deep inside Sgurr mountains ridge. The walk through heather moors is nice and impressive. Don't waste the time for bridge, continue via bridge to trail.",
          "This is a great location, mountains surrounding you are breathtaking and the water rushing over the rocks and under the bridge just adds to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the weather was not good when we visited, but because of the heavy rain the 'white water' was even more",
          "We stopped in here on the way to the Fairy Pools. What a gorgeous location! It was a very rare sunny day and everything was sparkling. The river, bridge, valley and mountains are breathtaking.",
          "Stopped off here a few times as the bridge parallels the new roads and is a natural junction. the third time we stopped we had brilliant sunshine and an amazing view of the Cuillin ridge. I had to laugh at the array of tourists with fancy cameras trying to get arty shots in the",

        "wiki": "Trotternish or Tr\u00f2ndairnis (Scottish Gaelic) is the northernmost peninsula of the Isle of Skye, in Scotland. Its most northerly point, Rubha H\u00f9inis, is the most northerly point of Skye.\nOne of the peninsula's better-known features is the Trotternish landslip, a massive landslide that runs almost the full length of the peninsula, some 30 kilometres (19 mi).  The landslip contains two of Skye's most famous landmarks: the Old Man of Storr, an isolated rocky pinnacle, and the Quiraing, an area of dramatic and unusual rock formations. The summit of The Storr, on whose slopes the Old Man of Storr is located, is the highest point of the peninsula. The north-eastern part of the peninsula around Quiraing is designated as a National Scenic Area and the entire landslip is a Special Area of Conservation. \nDinosaur footprints have been found at An Corran, which is also a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC. The ruins of the 14th\u201315th-century Duntulm Castle stand at the northern end of the peninsula.\nThe three major settlements on Trotternish are Portree, generally regarded as the capital of Skye, Uig, a ferry terminus, and Staffin. Trotternish is the strongest Gaelic-speaking area of Skye.\n\n\n== Geography and natural history ==\n\nTrotternish is underlain by basalt, which provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The Kilt Rock is named after the tartan-like patterns in the 105 metres (344 ft) cliffs. The Quiraing is a spectacular series of rock pinnacles on the eastern side of the main spine of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the Old Man of Storr. While having many vertical heights, the area is mainly unsuitable for rock-climbing due to the friable rock.At An Corran near Staffin a local resident found a slab bearing a dinosaur track, probably made by a small ornithopod. Experts subsequently found more dinosaur prints of up to 50 cm, the largest found in Scotland, made by a creature similar to Megalosaurus. At about 160 million years old they are the youngest dinosaur remains to be found in Scotland.\n\n\n=== Conservation designations ===\nThe north-eastern part of the peninsula around Quiraing is designated as the Trotternish National Scenic Area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 7,919 ha in total, of which 6,128 ha is on land, with a further 1789 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level, and covering the seas to the east of the peninsula).The entire length of the Trotternish landslip is protected as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the Natura 2000 programme, and classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at An Corran in Staffin is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at Sand, Applecross, on the mainland coast of Wester Ross where tools made of a mudstone from An Corran have been found. Surveys of the area between the two shores of the Inner Sound and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33 sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits.The ruined Duntulm Castle stands on a promontory at the northern end of the peninsula, near the hamlet of Duntulm. During the 17th century it was the seat of the chiefs of Clan MacDonald of Sleat, and is a scheduled monument. The castle is believed to stand on the site of a prehistoric broch or dun known as Dun David, or Dun Dhaibhidh, although no archaeological evidence has been found for this predecessor. The castle was built in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the area was subject to feuds between the rival MacLeod and Macdonald clans, and was abandoned around 1732, when Sir Alexander MacDonald built a new residence, Monkstadt House, 5 miles (8.0 km) to the south.Flodigarry north of Staffin was between 1750 and 1772 the home of Flora MacDonald, the Jacobite made famous by her part in Charles Edward Stuart's escape after his defeat at Culloden. She later moved to Kingsburgh on the southwestern coast of Trotternish, and it was here that Boswell and Johnson met her during their tour of the Western Isles in 1773. Johnson, who held Jacobite views when younger, commented that she was a woman of \"soft features, gentle manners and elegant presence\".\n\n\n== Gaelic ==\nIn terms of number of speakers, Trotternish is the strongest Gaelic-speaking area of Skye.  In the 2001 census, 61% of the population returned as Gaelic speakers, there are Gaelic-medium units in the Staffin and Kilmuir primary schools, and the area is the focus of one of Comunn na G\u00e0idhlig's Gaelic development initiatives, Lasair. In 2010, Comunn na G\u00e0idhlig named Staffin as their Gaelic Community of the Year.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe main road in Trotternish is the A87, which runs between Portree at the southern end of the peninsula and Uig on the northwest coast. Uig marks the northwestern terminus of the A87, with its southeastern terminus being the junction with the A82 at Invergarry, to the north of Fort William. The A855 road also links Portree and Uig, taking a route along the eastern coast and round the northern end of the peninsula: the two roads thus combine to encircle Trotternish. A minor road also crosses the peninsular, passing between Uig and Staffin via the Quiraing.Portree is the terminus for Scottish Citylink buses from Glasgow Buchanan bus station and Inverness, with some services continuing on to Uig. Uig serves as the ferry terminal for Caledonian MacBrayne services to Tarbert on Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist, providing links with the Outer Hebrides.\n\n\n== Settlements in Trotternish ==\nAchachork\nBornesketaig\nBrogaig\nCarbost\nDuntulm\nEllishadder\nEyre\nFlodigarry\nGarafad\nKensaleyre\nKilmaluag\nKilmuir\nKilvaxter\nKingsburgh\nLealt\nPortree\nSkeabost\nStaffin\nTote\nUig\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==",

          "The Trotternish peninsula on the north end of Skye is one of its most well-known tourist attractions, and with good reason, but that does mean some crowds during tourist season. Part of the road is single-track. Start the loop from Portree so that the scenic highlights are in",

          "The coastal road which winds north from Portree below the 30km Trotternish ridge (poss. translation Thrond\u2019s Headland) is one of the most beautiful drives anywhere. The ridge itself offers one of the finest walks in the UK. Within 6 miles the first stunning view of the highest",
          "Walking the ridge from end to end is quite demanding, well, actually, very demanding, and not for the faint hearted. To get an idea, start at the northern end, Bealach Oilesgarte (not named on maps) and walk up Bioda Buidhe (pronounced Botcha Boo-ey), and get the flavour before",
          "There is just so much to see for those who feel happy about stretching their legs a wee bit. Brothers Point, The Diatomite Mine and the seaviews are just great.",

        "wiki": "Maerl (also rhodolith) is a collective name for non-geniculate coralline red algae with a certain growth habit. Maerl grows at a rate of c. 1 mm per year. It accumulates as unattached particles and forms extensive beds in suitable sublittoral sites.  The term maerl originally refers to the branched growth form of Lemoine (1910) and rhodolith is a sedimentological or genetic term for both the nodular and branched growth forms (Basso et. al, 2015).\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn Europe maerl beds occur throughout the Mediterranean, along most of the Atlantic coast from Portugal to Norway, and in the English Channel, Irish Sea and North Sea. The distribution of maerl is dependent on water movement, light and salinity concentration. Maerl beds occur in the photic zone, and can be found to around 30 m depth in the British Isles and up to 120 m deep in the Mediterranean. Maerl deposits can reach up to 10 m thick, but are usually much thinner; carbon dating has shown that they can be more than 5500 years old.In the British Isles maerl is composed of three species of coralline algae growing loose in beds of fragmented nodules in the sub-littoral. The species generally involved are: Lithothamnion corallioides, Lithothamnion glaciale and Phymatolithon calcareum.Maerl is dredged from the sea floor and crushed to form a powder. It is still harvested around the coasts of Brittany in France and Bantry Bay, Ireland, and is a popular fertilizer for organic gardening. It was also dredged off Falmouth, Cornwall, but this ceased in 2004. Scientists investigated Falmouth maerl and found that L. corallioides predominated down to 6 m and P. calcareum from 6\u201310 m (Blunden et al., 1981).\n\nChemical analysis of maerl showed that it contained 32.1% CaCO3 and 3.1% MgCO3 (dry weight).\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe ecology of maerl habitats has received very little attention in contrast to other marine ecosystems such as kelp forests or sea grass beds. Maerl beds provide a complex habitat for a wide range of taxa with a variety of niches that support high associated invertebrate and algal biodiversity.\nMaerl beds act as nursery areas for the juvenile stages of commercial species such as juvenile cod Gadus morhua, saithe Pollachius virens, Pollack Pollachius pollachius and juvenile scallops Aequipecten opercularis. Maerl beds offer physical refuge and protection from predation as well as productive feeding grounds but are easily damaged by dredging and towed fishing gear.Maerl has no tolerance for desiccation.\n\n\n== History ==\nMaerl has been extracted for centuries mainly for use as an agricultural fertilizer. The amount extracted increased in the late 20th century and in 2000, maerl was extracted at c. 5,000 tonnes per year in Ireland and c. 500,000 tonnes per year in France. Large scale maerl extraction over the past 40 years has removed and degraded maerl beds. In Cornwall, England, maerl has been extracted since the 1970s, but was banned in 2005 by Falmouth Harbour Commissioners.An early reference to maerl was made by John Ray in 1690 who reported it from Falmouth. In Ireland, maerl is extracted from subfossil beds in Bantry Bay by Celtic Sea Minerals.  The maerl-forming species Lithothamion corallioides and Phymatolithon calcareum are listed in Annex V of the EC Habitats Directive.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nUsed as a soil conditioner, it is dredged from the sea floor and crushed to a powder.\nThe slow growth of individual nodules and their accumulation in beds over a millennial timescale means that there is no possibility of maerl keeping up with dredging for this purpose. Maerl should be considered as a non-renewable resource, and readily available alternative products (e.g., garden lime) make modern day exploitation controversial.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "My wife and went here just after Christmas it was about 10am when we got there and there wasn\u2019t a soul around the whole couple of hours we spent there, it\u2019s a bit of drive but once in the car park there it was easy enough to get to, it\u2019s definitely worth a visit we saw seals",
          "Car park is very small and has huge pot holes so beware!! It\u2019s a good 15-20mins walk from the car park to the coral beach, if you get to the black beach, just go over the hill you can see in front of you and from there the coral beach will be visible. We went on Boxing Day,",
          "we took our dog a walk out to the beach which was very nice but as is typical with skye in the middle of summer parking was a nightmare with people all over the place and cars stuck in ditches almost on there sides which lets it down a bit",
          "Really nice walk along the coast line to reach the coral beach, its only a mile way and with a path not too strenuous. It's a 'white beach' white from the coral fragments and shells also a nice place to paddle in the clear sea water of Loch Dunvegan",

Imagine sending your friends back home pictures that would make Caribbean travels jealous. Sure the water is colder, but that didn\u2019t stop me from going in up",
          "We visited in September and although the car park was full when we arrived it wasn\u2019t in chaos and a short wait resulted in a space as at this time of year there is a regular turnover of people doing the walk there and back rather than spending the day there. It\u2019s clear that",
          "The roads to get to this place are the usual poor potholed affair that you can encounter when off the beaten track. We\u2019ve been before and loved it but on this visit we had to turn back as there was no parking. All spaces were full and people were even parking where they should",

So take extra time, don\u2019t",

          "Although the weather wasn\u2019t brilliant it\u2019s a lovely walk to the beach and, if you\u2019re prepared for a climb, some great views as well. Parking could be a problem in high season so get there early.",
          "We loved this! We did have a most amazing weather day which I think added to the day. We climbed to the top of a very tall hill once we got there that has a fantastic view. I would say parking was very difficult and it was a long walk to the beach but was well worth it!",

          "To reach the beach you have to go through a very narrow road and after that a 30 minute walk awaits you before you reach the beach. But it's worth it. One would never expect to find such crystal waters and white sands on a remote corner of a Scottish island, battered by winds",
          "The beach really feels like it doesn't belong. That say, you can't really enjoy a beach on Skye. We were there on the sunniest day that you can get in Scotland and the water was still too cold to swim",
          "There are over 600 reviews about this beach, it is beautiful. Like all of the must-see places on Skye, parking is an issue. I do feel for the local residents. The place is quiet, tranquil and restful, until two drones turned up. The incessant whine of these machines will ruin",
          "Few miles of a challenging drive, then stressful parking then a longer than expected walk to finally arrive at a very small beach. The coral is pretty however the blue water is not as vibrant as is made out. And given its popularity it isn\u2019t an overly quiet beach. Worth seeing",
          "This is an interesting place to visit, but we read the car park is really small so we went early. We arrived at about 9am and grabbed the last space bar one! It's about a 30- to 40-minute walk to the beach, but it's easy enough. There are no toilets here at all though, or",
          "Great place. Maybe, according to the reviews. But in typical Isle of Skye fashion, there are 10 parking spaces at the end of a very poor and windy road. This island just doesn\u2019t cater for the tourists that flock here. We had no option but to turn around and drive back.",
          "Situated near Dunvegan Castle it is well worth investing a couple of hours. Even on a midweek afternoon in May it was busy and as a result parking is limited. But it was definitely worthwhile for a fairly easy coastal walk to a stunning coral beach. Do make the effort to climb",
          "Well worth a visit. Easy walk in once you negotiate the car park!! Beautiful on a sunny day and the extra walk up onto the viewing hill is worth it too. Look out for the seals on the rocks opposite the beach",
          "A visit to Skye would not be complete without a visit to the Coral Beach. Even on a cloudy day it is amazing, although stay for sunshine and the glow is spectacular. We sat and watched seals in the bay and observed a sea otter as we walked back along the path. This is not for",
          "What a striking contrast the sea, sand and black rocks make. It was pretty wonderful. Really enjoyed our visit here. There isn't really any advice needed. Would imagine getting there and parking in the summer to be a bit intense. April was perfect - quiet.",
          "Really enjoyed our afternoon here, walking to the rocks and looking through the rock pools. We climbed to a bit of rock out of the way and saw wild seals! It was an incredible sight, well worth the walk. The white beach is full of seashells and coral and the water is so clear.",
          "I did not expect the beautiful sight that met me on my visit to Coral Bay! Definitely worth a visit. It\u2019s like a tropical beach. Alas even in the sun it was a little chilly!! The colour of the water is also stunning! Even dipped my piggies!! Freeeeezing but worth it! There is a",
          "Gorgeous coral beach. Stunning scenery and plenty to explore. This is a reasonable Walk from the small car park (this is just up the road from Dunvegan on a single track road- lots of passing places) the carpark will get very busy, it was full when we got there at 3pm on a",
          "The walk takes about 1 mile to get to the actual beach but it is worth the work. Gorgeous views of the coastline and the coral beach. We loved it and wanted to do it again!",
          "This is a 1.2 mile walk out to the beach but it goes by quickly as you are looking at all the sights ... the ocean, the cliffs, the cows and the sheep grazing in the area. Dogs are allowed but must be on a leash. It was misty and foggy on our visit but still worth the walk.",
          "What a stunning beach, the water is so clear. this was a highlight of my trip. Glad I was there in March as parking must be a nightmare in the summer!",
          "We followed the narrow single track road to the end and parked in the car park. The car park can\u2019t fit anymore than 15 cars max. Not a problem on a wet weekday afternoon in March but could see why all the farms had signs saying \u201cno parking, access needed at all times\u201d as in",
          "There\u2019s a fair walk in - over half a mile I\u2019d say - but it\u2019s pretty flat & so worth it! You can see the turquoise sea colour on a dull day, but it looks much better with blue skies.",
          "amazing location with beautiful views. The water colour is just spectacular, only accessible by the car park , easy to find",
          "Small car park so if you go in season I suggest that you go early in the day so you\u2019re not disappointed Easy gentle walk through a field to get to the beach so perfect if you are on a family holiday,an easy walk for children It was a bit off putting on the way, the beach\u2019s",

          "This is an attractive beach , formed from crushed skeletons of Coralline seaweed rather than true coral ,giving it it's white colour in sunlight in contrast to the black volcanic rocks on this beach and elsewhere. Choose your day to visit wisely - it is best visited on a clear",
          "We loved this beach so much we visited twice on our week holiday! Highly recommend a visit. The beach literally glows :)",
          "I highly recommend stopping here. The walk from the car park was easy going on well marked trails. You get to a black stone beach and then there is a distinct line where the black stone ends and the coral beach begins. And on closer inspecting the \u201csand\u201d isn\u2019t sand at all but",
          "This is a relatively easy walk to the beach and will take approx 30 mins each way. There is limited parking at the end of the track. The walk is through some fields and the path is uneven, can be muddy and wet so walking boots are recommended. When you reach the beach it is",
          "You can park in the small car park but even though it is October it was still pretty busy. The walk to the beach is through farm land but there is a clear path. The path is quite muddy and a bit uneven so good shoes needed. The beach itself is stunning with beautiful coral sand",
          "You park in a small car park it was busy in sept so summer you will struggle parking .A lovely walk through a couple of fields and you arrive at a lovely golden sandy beach,if you time it right with the tides you can walk across to a small island ,good walk and great for dogs.",

          "We visited the coral beach today and enjoyed a lovely walk along the coastline. It was a particularly windy day, so wrap up as there\u2019s not much shelter! The beach itself to walk along is beautiful! This is also a very easy walk, with an option to climb up a steep hill at the end",
          "A stunning coral beach amidst the rocky Skye coastline. A short, brisk walk along the coast to see this gem of a beach. Well worth the journey.",
          "The beach is very unusual in that it is made out of 'coral' (rather dead bits of seaweed that are hard and white, and shells). It is about a 15 minute walk from the car park, which was absolutely packed. We sat and watched seals popping up and down in the water, which was is",
          "Limited place in car park but worth the walk to the beach. An easy walk and a good track. Saw seals, sheep and cows and the odd jellyfish on the beach. More beach when the tide is out - lovely to see and a great view.",
          "We knew parking could be an issue after reading other reviews so we ventured up the single track road early in the day (10am). We did not have difficulty finding a place to park, but the tight car park area was jammed when we returned from the walk a few hours later. The walk",
          "After a short 15 minute walk from the end of the road we arrived at the beach mid afternoon. The beach itself was much smaller than we expected but the views were still pleasant. Worth a visit if in the area but not worth travelling a great distance to and its probably best to",
          "The hike to reach this beach is worth the walk. We ventured through a herd of cattle to reach the beach, and we walked with the cattle while leaving. The coral \"sand\" is amazing, and dipping your toes in the cool water is a must. Beautiful sight!",
          "Truly lovely to wander along these beautiful beaches but the approach is single track and there are very many people wanting to share the beauty so that the very limited parking becomes like a game of dodgems. So sad to see this. Local people are clearly tired of visitors using",
          "It was really amazing to see all those white shells in a bay surrounded by black rocks. We had light rain during our visit and it was a nice experience. It must be even more beautiful in the sun.",

          "Gorgeous little beach that's a bit of a drive out, worth getting to early, then you park up and walk for about 15/20 mins. The track walk is pretty suitable for those with families or those who might find more challenging walks along some of the island's bigger view points",
          "We weren\u2019t blessed with great weather which was a shame, but it\u2019s still an enjoyable stroll down to this sandy beach. It doesn\u2019t compete with the best of Cornwall or further afield, but it\u2019s a lovely contrast to other parts of the island, the water is beautifully clear and the",

          "The parking is limited, so would recommend getting there early. The walk takes about 15-20 mins. The beach is not coral but coralline seaweed, which gives the beach its white colour. It is a wonderful place to relax with great views from the hill above the beach. Glorious!",
          "Firstly, this is quite a small stretch of beach. Plus, it's a very long walk from the small car park. The reason it didn't get a fifth star. However, if you want an absolutely stunning view across Dunvegan's sea Loch and a beach that is hard to beat, then this could be for you.",
          "Long walk to the beach but worth it when you get there. Not massively long beach but white sand and turquoise water especially when sun is out. Worth a visit.",
          "There is a lovely walk from the car park taking the path parallel to the sea until you reach the coral beaches. You get great views of Macleod\u2018s tables across Loch Dunvegan. The walk takes a good 20 mins + to get to the first coral beach, and beyond the second is a little hill",
          "We had beautiful weather for our trip to the beach and we got pretty badly sunburnt. Don\u2019t let the gentle Scottish breeze trick you! We got lucky with parking and found a spot but when we were leaving things were far more packed meaning we had to just reverse out rather than",
          "Lucky to find a parking space here so it's probably best to head there early. Nice stroll along with visitors and locals. A wedding party was dropped off by boat while we watched. Also enjoyed seeing the cows on the beach.",
          "Get there early! There is just one car park and its down a single track road so we experienced the usual camper vans blocking the road and it was tricky to get parked. We got parked okay (just) but others didn't and were turning around and leaving. My tip would be to get",
          "The beach is about a mile from the car park but it\u2019s a gentle walk to the shore line. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a lead as the path is through fields with livestock in. The beach is white made up from coral particles and the sea is blue. We spent a couple of hours",
          "What a super place! You have to park 1/2 hour walk away from the beach so not for the faint hearted. But do go! It;s such a lovely peaceful; place if you visit early or late and the seals will entertain you for as long as you want!",
          "Around a 20 minute walk to the beach. We went one evening and sat out till 11pm. We watched the cows graze and then go into the sea paddling around 10pm, we also saw seals too. The second night we decided to camp on the grass and that was an amazing experience. Lots of midges on",
          "OK it's obviously not a Bondi Beach but as can be see from the mainly rocky beaches in the context of the Isle a sandy beach is a rarity. Also it reveals almost unbelievably that like Ireland, Scotland was also once in tropical waters. One other thing we loved about the",
          "A lovely spot but terribly windy and a bit of a walk from the car park. It's definitely not a 'proper' walk, and you may have to jump some rivers but it is very gorgeous and worth it for the views. One thing I will say is WATCH THE TIDE if you walk out to the island in front of",
          "The sun came out as we arrived at the beach on a Monday evening and made the coral even whiter. We enjoyed the 30 minute walk to the beach from the car park through fields of sheep. The water was clear and inviting although too cold to paddle. We could see the opposite headland",
          "It was a really wet day when we visited which probably impacted the views. We weren't very impressed when we got there to be honest - just looked like a normal shingle beach - until we sat down. Then we realised that the shingle wasn't small pieces of rock but actually tiny",
          "A lovely walk to a beach which looks just like abroad in the sun! The views from the hill beside it are spectacular. Worth a visit.",
          "Managed to get into the car park, no mean feat as this is a busy place especially Easter weekend. A wee mile walk to the coral beach, well worth a visit if only to see more of the stunning scenery in this area, feeling the coral between your fingers is both superb and",
          "In the summer this place is idyllic, at the beginning of spring, with the tail end of the Beast from the East,. . . . well it\u2019s a completely different place altogether . . Bundled up in our thermals it still looks very nice. OK it had stopped raining and the sun was out ( in",
          "When other reviews say this beach is like a Caribbean Beach they do not lie as we have travelled all over the Caribbean and this is definitely on a par. The main difference is the attire you need when on the beach, not a swim suit day when we visited but beautiful all the same.",
          "It was a lovely place to visit - a lovely walk to reach it. Signs everywhere to keep your dogs on a lead, which I did not by everybody which is a shame. The colour of the sea is unforgettable. I went again very early before anybody else was there and it was absolutely magic",
          "More stunning scenery, on the day we visited it was glorious sunshine and you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Caribbean. The coral that makes up the beach is graded by the sea from large pieces at one end of the beach to very small sand like particles at the other",
          "Beatiful beach, freezing water! But what thrill to put our feet in the crystal clear water of the Atlantic ocean!",
          "From parking up there is a lovely walk to the white coral beach. The sea is clear with lots of wildlife to see. This is definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Skye.",
          "This was our second stop of the day after Neist Point and we're very happy we made the effort. The stroll to the end of the beach is practically flat and the views are stunning. There were lots of cars in the parking area, but the area did not feel crowded. It's a very",
          "This is a beautiful stretch of beach hidden in the north-western corner of Skye by the village of Claigan. Depsite the name, it\u2019s not really coral but hardened bleached algae though a variety of colourful shells are noticeable on the beach. From the carpark, you open a gate and",
          "It was windy and bracing but wouldn't have missed the walk to the Coral Beach. So unexpectedly beautiful in this wonderful, rugged landscape and we spent an hour just looking up at the view and down at the endlessly fascinating shells on the beach. Geoff and Hilary I",
          "Amazingly beautiful and peaceful beach, one of the most beautiful I have ever been. We were lucky to be there on a sunny day, so walking there from the carpark (which is very small!) was enjoyable and the path easy to walk (can be muddy when wet). White beach and beautiful",
          "Lovely walk to the beach and would be stunning if you get a sunny day - we got soaked to the skin as it was blowing a gale and pouring so not recommended in this type of weather unless you have the right attire. Beware about the car parking as it is extremely limited",
          "You have to walk about a mile from the car park to get to the beaches, but this helps to preserve the quiet, remote nature of the place. I visited very early in the morning, so there was no one else around - I suspect that t can be very busy at other times.",
          "I'd seen the reviews on tripadvisor so decided to visit after going to Dunvegan Castle. You just keep driving after the castle until you get to a car park. The road between the castle and the car park is single track but it's only for a few miles. The car park isn't that big",
          "Good 30 minute trek each way along sometimes muddy path but worth it for the views, can be difficult to get parked.",
          "We got here around lunch time to find the car park quite busy but a few spaces left. After a walk of about a mile you arrive at the beach. When we got there it was very quiet with only another 5 or 6 people. The water was crystal clean and the beach is something else. The beach",
          "An absolute gem of a place . It's about 2 miles past Dunvegan castle and there is a small car park . Be warned it gets very busy and you may struggle to find a space . It's about a 30 min walk from the car park , through the sunbathing cows ! Honestly never thought i would see",
          "This was a lovely place to visit an easy walk out to a beautiuful beach with fantastic views....we had a lovely afternoon here",
          "From a small car park it is a short walk to this 'coral' beach with great views towards the Waternish peninsula and a number of small islands. From the beach we spent some time watching the seals in the water as well as the fishermen offshore checking their lobster pots. I would",
          "Would have loved to visit but after travelling down the single track for a few miles came to the end of the road to discover no parking. Cars and camper vans lined the only available space at the side of the track. We had difficulty turning round but reluctantly left without",
          "Un-spoilt, beautiful beach on the north coast of Skye. Great for families and kids, too. Added benefit is watching the people walking out to the small island just off the coast and betting on whether they manage to remember walking back before the tide comes in :-)",
          "Enjoyable walk out to the beach from the car park , but the beach is limited in size and not that dramatic considering the other sites on the island. Worth a visit though!",
          "Easy walk from the car park (approximately 30min). Nice beach with great views. Bring your own pick nick and have a great time!",
          "What a stunning sight this beach was as you come over the brow of the hill. The white shell beach is amazing. It's an easy walk from the car park to the beach and even if it was trickier it would have been worth the effort. Everyone should see this beach.",
          "One of the best short walks on the Isle Of Skye, on a good day it's quite amazing - maybe not up to Caribbean standards or Great Barrier Reef but then this is Scotland - so give a little leeway please. You won't be disappointed unless you nit pick! My only concern is the",
          "i honestly can't believe anybody would be disappointed in this place regardless of where they are from or beaches they had seen . It is one of the most beautiful un spoiled beaches i have ever been to . We went at the start of August and it wasn't that busy at all quite a big",
          "For Aussies/Kiwis, you'll probably be disappointing by this beach. It's a nice walk with pretty views but it's an average beach by antipodean standards. It is easy though to see why the Poms and Northern Europeans would get excited by it, as it would almost be possible to get in",
          "We took the walk in August (so high season). Parking was quite difficult, due to many visitors, including a few rental RVs (which had no way to park, and could only turn around with great difficulty). The walk is easy, with only small elevation differences, and has fantastic",
          "Around a mile from the car park (found at the end of the single track past dunvegan castle) to the beaches. Nice easy walk for the little ones to the secluded beaches full of shells. Car park is small and fills up quickly. No facilities nearby.",
          "Kids enjoyed the views and the rock pools where there were plenty of jellyfish. The views across the bay are good and the small hill gives a different perspective then the beach. The car park was busy but people coming and going all the time so a space quickly became available.",
          "Bit of a trip to get there (single-lane road with the occasional rude driver), but worth it. So unexpected to see this stretch of white coral beach and turquoise water this far north. It's a beautiful spot to spend a few hours.",
          "We were very lucky with the weather on the day we went ie. it wasn't raining! What a fantastic place. My children even enjoyed the walk but it was the flying attempts for them on the hill in front of the beach. Worth the walk and if possible go early as parking is limited and",
          "what a trip. we had 30 degrease, nice, sunny, lovely day a corals everywhere. don't fall for the first beach, get going on the path and it will open in front of you.",
          "It is long way to walk to see The coral Beach but it is worth it . On The walk to The Beach we saw cows",
          "This beach initially jumps out at you out of a typically rugged Scottish coastline. Gleaming white in the distance - you would immediately think it is white sand. But on closer examination it is fine coral!! A real jewel in a stunning and remote landscape. A must see in Skye.",
          "Really enjoyed walking Up there ! Sunday morning 7:30 - fitst once Up there - amazing !! Worth the walk Up !!",
          "The beach is a good 30 min walk from the small car park, but it is well worth the walk, seals were swimming only metres from the shore which adds to this memorable experience. The beach was spotless and I opted for a swim to cool off. I would visit this beach again on any return",
          "First morning in Skye and it was rainy and foggy. Once we got here though the rain stopped and it was just windy and cloudy. We walked to the first part where it opens up to a beach and decided to walk up the hill where there was a path going in between an opening in a stone",
          "This is a pleasant walk to a nice beach, especially on a sunny day. But it gets very crowded. On our second visit there were wild campers with tents still pitched in the early afternoon, and families playing ball games and preparing to barbecue. In our opinion there are also",
          "Beautiful spot. Need to get there early to find a parking space and remember to park considerately to maximise space for other users. Also strongly suggest visitors take their rubbish away with them to preserve the beauty of this place for other visitors.",
          "The walk and the beach was nice. Water on a sunny day was indeed caribbean blue. Excluding cattle there was no wildlife which was our main reason for visiting the place. So decent 4 points for the attraction itself. I am an experienced driver period. Still car parking there is a",
          "I took a trip out to the Beach early Evening as other reviews complained of it being busy. In hindsight most nice places by definition will be busy but the Early Evening was lovely. This is a place where the weather will improve the experience as it is apparently much better on",
          "Claimants Coral Beach was a little gem. The walk to get to it was extremely enjoyable with incredible view and it was very flat. We saw a lot of seals playing about in the water and the small coral beach was lovely. From the hill behind, you can get a lovely view of the",
          "Never seen such white coral sand before. This place offers an amazing view. Crowded and rubbish parking (could be worse), but hey it was awesome.",
          "It is worth going if you are already at Dunvegan Castle. The walk is pleasant enough, but when we went there were heaps of people walking along the wide track. The coastal views are nice but so are many other parts. The beach itself is outstanding for its colour of shells but is",
          "I hate to bash things but this was a big disappointment, the drive there is far from easy and stress free. Same applies for the parking. The walk is long and tedious and when you get there it's not all what it's cracked up to be. It's honestly not that great, spend your time on",
          "I've been in coral beach and I'm going to explain you a bit... the coral beach is maybe the name because I would call it the black and white beach... if you like the basalt rocks covered with algae in a white sand beach, I strongly recommend you to visit it... if you are looking",
          "We followed every website's direction to that so called idyllic beach but really why do people exaggerate so much? The colour of the waters at some (2, maybe 3) points may look somewhat turquoise but it is all depending on the light, the wind and most predominantly, the tide.",
          "If you are looking for a short picturesque walk this is ideal. It's about 1.3 miles each way and the beach is very pretty with little white shells and calcified remains of sea plankton. It is creamy white and the sea is very pale blue therefore a scenic spot. Lots of seals in",
          "We have been to the Coral Beach twice and I cannot wait to go back. My favorite thing is to lay on the beach and look at it up close. All the pieces of white coral give the beach such a tropical look. A short walk but worth it!",
          "First off, I hate to disappoint another reviewer, but it is NOT actual coral on this beach--it's fossilized and sun-bleached algae. So there's that. The issue with this beach is the parking, which was nightmarish when we were there. Cars jockeying back and forth on a",
          "Definitely worth a visit, I did not expect to find actual pieces of coral washed up on the beach. We had the beach to ourselves for most of our visit. Short walk down a path, steep in places but manageable.",
          "I'm not sure if it was the weather the day I visited or the low tide but I didn't think this was anything special. Definitely not one of the more prettier beaches. I wouldn't spend the time walking all the way down there for this beach when there are so many more things to see",
          "This is a bit of a walk from the car park (longer than I expected) through a meadow and then a farm with bulls (be careful it says on the sign) but at the end of it there is a beautiful harbor with a coral beach. The water is an aqua hue and beautiful to see. Worth the walk. It",
          "You have to walk a mile or so to the coral beach but it is very well worth doing so. Throughout the pleasant walk along a substantial track the views are great, and the beach itself truly remarkable - I never expected to find a coral beach so far North! While there we saw",
          "This is an easy walk along a farm track, from the car park. The Beach is stunning, with its white beach made of shells and coral, and the water such a turquoise blue colour that you would never believe it was Scotland, more like a tropical beach. Great for walks, picnics or",
          "Went here on recommendation and found it really lovely. It is not far from Dunvegan castle and has car parking. The walk is quite manageable for me as an old age pensioner and we saw many basking seals on the nearby island. Great place to take a picnic and just enjoy the",
          "There is about a mile walk to reach this beach from the carpark and the parking is very tight. Having said that, when you see the beach from the distance it looks like white sand. It is actually crushed coral when you get up close. There aren't many beaches on Skye but I would",
          "Nice walk from the car park along the coast until you finally get to the beach. It was very interesting to not have sand but be made up of crushed coral! Was fun for my toddler to potter around on, collecting shells in her bucket.",
          "This is a great beach to visit. There is a parking lot which had plenty of room in it when we went. There is a short walk to get to the beach. Part of the walk is up a short hill, in case you have mobility issues. Not a very large beach but very pretty. There are a lot of small",
          "We stopped by after visiting Dunvegan Castle. The beach is a 10 min drive and then a 15 walk along the coast. The beach is small but very clean and along another wonderful piece of Skye coastline. Not much else to do other than drink in the scenery and enjoy whatever rays of",
          "The Coral Beach isn't exactly Coral but it is unusual and on a sunny day out of season, it is well worth the walk. Keep dogs on leads until you are past the cows and I would recommend either decent boots or walking wellies so you can have a scramble and explore a bit. If the",
          "We walked out to the beach expecting something special. It is quite a nice walk. The beach itself, there is just one, was really quite disappointing. There are many far nicer beaches on the island. I wouldn't go out if my way to go here unless you are nearby.",
          "This is a nice walk at any time of the year which affords some lovely views out to the Outer Hebrides. Nice to see that there is a thriving colony of inquisitive seals too. Good to photograph the Northern lights and you can also see round to Stein. The one thing this beach is",
          "Well worth the short walk from the car park along the shore until you spot the beach. We were there on a sunny warm day which shows the beach at its best. It was possible to walk over to the small island as the tide was very low, but be aware the tide comes back in very quickly.",
          "We walked from the car park took about 20mins, easy walk. Beautiful white viral beach and also quite popular.",
          "A lovely walk down to Coral Beach. Turquoise sea with seals basking, beautiful white sand and wonderful peace. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely walk to a stunning beach with amazing views. Quite an easy walk. Pick a dry day though. Great for a picnic and watch the world go by.",
          "I'm walking towards a snow white beach on a sunny day in warm weather on the Isle of Skye. It doesn't get better for a city dweller than that. Worth every step.",
          "The beach has barely any coral and is kind of plain. It's over a mile to walk there through cow paddocks. If you are keen to drive on windy narrow roads at night then apparently the sunset is amazing. the best bit about the beach though is the drive there. Pull over in the",
          "Just a lovely spot. The sea looks like you are abroad its so clear around the white coral. Good views and just a really pleasant walk especially in May when the light is so wonderful and less likely for a midgey attack.",
          "Not much parking here, if you get parked it's a half hour walk along a reasonable path to the coral beaches. They are small and very pretty in the sunshine as they are very white. Dogs must be kept on a lead as there are sheep everywhere. Good for an hour or too, maybe longer if",
          "Car park easy to find as it's at the end of the road. Track to follow well laid out . If you have a dog be aware there are cows in the the vicinity. Quite a windy little track , but worthwhile doing . You will be glad you went. On the way to car park you should see quite a lot",
          "The walk from the car park has to be longer than is stated on the board but it is quite a nice walk and its fairly flat. We were rewarded with an impromptu seal show as a whole group of them frolicked in the wayer im front of us! The beach itself is beautiful.",
          "We parked in the designated car park, put on our walking boots and were on our way!. The walk is very pretty with views of the loch, the surrounding hills and mountains and the Outer Hebrides further out to sea. As we walked we watched seven or eight seals who just bobbed around",
          "It's a okay beach, not so much exciting for me as I have visited lot of beaches. It was not so exciting, you can give it a miss if you can. Nothing much.",
          "This beach is really particular due to its \"corals\" (which are in fact dried pieces of algae, called \"maerl\", but nevertheless stunning). A short hike is necessary, though, and can be pretty muddy after rain. The road to Claigan is single track, with some potholes - but not",
          "Drove up to the little car park - be aware, it may be busy in summer - parked up and headed off on our walk. It is a pleasant stroll along a bit of the coast where you can keep an eye out for an array of wildlife from seabirds to whales, dolphins, seals and maybe eagles! The",
          "loved this little beach, such a surprise when you walk over the top of the hill and it's before you, fantastic views in all directions, and we saw a few seals on a nearby island. just lovely!",
          "It's like you are treated to a little bit of the Caribbean in the north west of Scotland as there is almost white sand and a green/blue sea but be warned : this is only a small area and you have to walk just over a mile (2 km?) from the car park to reach it !",
          "Suspect it would be nicer on a sunny day but I have to agree that it's not as spectacular as the hype. Took about 40 minutes from the car park to get out to the headland. Lovely views and location overall. Stopped off at the Lochside cafe on the way back near Dunvegan Castle for",
          "This beach is well worth the mile walk from the car park. The contrasts and colours is nature at it very best.",
          "I would give this place the skip next time. Other places in Skye offer a lot more. However, the drive leading upto this place is absolutely beautiful. The beach itself is very very disappointing. Average at best.",
          "Worth the walk , stunning place . Bit of a walk and check the tide times . Car park at the end of the road and then about 1.2 miles",
          "We were really lucky with the weather when we arrived and after the short 15 minute walk in the afternoon sun we upon the beach. The pictures really do not do this justice - and walking up onto the small hill at the end of beach gives an aspiring view of the area. On the drive",
          "Lovely walk from small car park down to gorgeous beach. Our lab Marley loved it and the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. Allow about hour and half there and back depending of course if you can drag yourself away.",
          "You pull into a small car about a 5 minute drive past Dunvegan Castle. From there you walk a well laid out path to a small coral beach, keep on walking over the hill between a large dry stone dyke. At the top of the hill you get the first view of the Coral Beach. It is",
          "A nice easy walk to the beach. I'll warn you, the beach is not huge, but it's nice and we went early on a February morning so it was pretty quiet. Hopefully you'll have it to yourselves too.",
          "Unfortunately it was a cold, wet and windy afternoon when we visited but it was on my 'to do' list and we had doubled up with a visit to Dunvegan Castle. A small car park (no facilities) and mixed terrain but a well trodden path so you won't get lost, it was worth a visit.",
          "Easily the highlight of our break. Lucky enough to go on a really sunny day and be (almost) alone there! The water was so crystal clear I had to have a paddle - in February! I love the way nothing has been done there to detract from The naturalness of the environment. Pure and",
          "We loved this place, takes an hour or so accross potentially boggy ground to get there, but make sure you do. Its one of the stranger sites i have seen which makes it a must see. Make sure to go right round as far as you can to get more great views, specially from the top of the",
          "2 attempts to make it to the Coral beach...1st day just too wet, the next time was a success although still a bit damp, definitely cold and very very windy. Well worth the effort. Although the beach is a little ordinary it still has its own uniqueness and beauty. It's raw and",
          "It took us an hour to walk to the beach, but it was flat, easy, and enjoyable. This area contrasts with the hills and heaths of the Isle and we were pleasantly surprised to discover such amazing beaches and ocean views on this rugged, rocky island!",
          "About a 45 min walk with varied terrain to a beautiful bay and clear turquoise sea. Well worth the effort - mind out for the boggy bits and the stepping stones! Lovely little tumbledown croft near the shore - made me wonder who had such a lovely view - I'm sure they must have",
          "Weather was good so decided to visit coral beach. Car park not very big and was quite full when we arrived which was mid to late afternoon. Took us about 45 minutes to walk but we stopped a few times to take in the scenery and of course take pictures. Beach is very unusual as it",
          "Tranquility, one with nature, it's all here, in the air, on the beach, and scurrying along the ground. One of the most serene places on earth",
          "We didn't arrive at the car park until around 2pm in late November on a bright sunny afternoon, no breeze at all. The rocky path to the beach was rocky, sloping and somewhat wet and even icy in places. Good sturdy waterproof shoes needed as parts of the walk is quite soft and",
          "Visited here during a trip in February. Picked up a couple of hitchhikers during our drive around the isle and mentioned that we were making the long drive down to this beach. It's a decent mile or so walk to the beach, and in suspect weather, it may be quite slippy underfoot.",
          "On a cold drizzley day we decided to go to find the coral beach. from the car park it is a mile walk through stunning scenary.If you have a dog you need to keep it on a lead due to livestock. The pathway is at times uneven and rugged wear walking boots or wellies as you do have",
          "Short walk from the car park, rough ground in parts if you're thinking about push chairs or wheelchairs. We walked trough a shower then when we got there a stunning winter sun came out. Spent a lovely couple of hours just exploring and enjoying the beautiful beach, views and",
          "What a great place! The walk from the car park is just over a mile, but it's worth it. In cooler, wetter weather, wellies/hiking boots are a must as the path gets quite muddy. We went on a particularly windy day, so we were in warm layers with gloves and hats. The drive to the",
          "We visited off season and went early in the morning which was really nice....though we didn't have to ourselves for veyr long. Worth a visit.",
          "Lovely walk beautiful beach great for the dog but just be wary of any livestock about. Low water you can walk across to the island.",
          "What a beautiful beach it is. It looks like the one from Scottish calendars, that you think it's not real or must have been Photoshoped but this beach is for real! Go to the hill beside it, and you would get even a better view!",
          "You do not believe you can get a beach like that in Scotland.You think to be in Cuba.There is a little parking place.Leave the car there and walk for an half of an hour.The path is simple and nearly flat.Before getting the beach you climb a little and then get the beach , really",
          "A beautiful location that can be enjoyed by visitors of all ages. Busier than expected even out of season, but this is all relative - you can still find a quiet spot as everyone spreads out. The car park was busy late afternoon, and the walk to the beach seems longer than the 1",
          "After a day of cruzin around we pulled up here and went for a nice stroll. Its a nice spot to eat lunch or drink a bottle of wine. Enjoyed the drive and the views",
          "Lovely walk across moorland to the beach. You can see the pieces of coral quite clearly when you get there. There is a small hill behind the beach which is worth climbing for stunning views of the area.",
          "Just stunning...there isn't much I can put into words that will do this beach any justice so will only say a must visit if you are in this area.",
          "Came with rabbies tour and the guide said this was supposed to be a hidden gem but after looking it up it's all over TripAdvisor already! Along the little path for 10 minutes or so you will reach the beach area and behind that there is a white sand dune. Beautiful area and",
          "A relatively easy walk (with muddy parts and a few small streams to cross after rain) is well worth it, the beach is gorgeous and affords plenty safe space for youngsters to run around. Small hillock at beach for those with adventurous 7 year olds to scramble up and down - well",
          "Nice walk by the sea, not too far, pretty beach and tiny wee hill at the end to see the views. Skye is a really amazing place and this is well worth a visit if your up there! I loved this one, go it's a great place to be on a sunny day.",
          "A lovely beach, with a moderate walk to reach it. Well worth the effort, and great for all the family. Combine with a trip to Dunvegan Castle.",
          "I visited on a Monday morning in October so I was a little surprised at how busy this place was. The car park was busy when I arrived, and full when I left a few hours later, and I was never out of sight of another group. The reason for this being so popular was apparent when",
          "Nice little walk to the beach. We went early in the morning to enjoy it by ourselves because it is only a little beach....... but very popular!",
          "We walked from Dunvegan to the Coral Beach as we wanted a long walk that day but there is a car park at Claigan for those that want a short walk to the beach. This was a beautiful spot and is well worth the visit.",
          "A few miles outside Dunvegan this little beach is well worth the walk from the car park. Not a difficult walk at all and we were lucky to be there on a beautiful day where the water was both crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight. Take a walk up the wee hill for a great",
          "After squeezing the car into the tight carpark we headed off towards the beach down a very rugged path. At first sight we wondered what the fuss was all about. Large black rocks greeted us for the first part of the way. After cresting a slight rise we got our first sight of our",
          "The beach is about 3 miles past Dunvegan Castle. The car park is situated probably about a mile and a half from the beach. Don't be fooled by the first sight of a beach you get... Keep walking until you finally see the white sands! The walk is not too difficult - we took our 5",
          "The first part of the pathway is pretty easy going - could do it in trainers. Down onto the first beach is no problem. But if you're looking to do the bigger beach you'll need proper walking shoes as evidenced by the daft foreigner types who are completely unprepared in flip",
          "We had both during our visit and a lot of wind. Be sure to wear sturdy footwear. It's a good 20 minute walk to the beach and the views are spectacular. I guess it will me easier to enjoy on a clear sunny day. Beautiful beach, clear water and a good walk.",
          "A beautiful place near from dunvengan's castle. You have to visit for take some photos! It's free and car park it's free too! When you parks your car you have to walk about 10 minutes until you see the beach.",
          "We had wet and windy weather most of the time we spent in Skye. After too much driving, during a lull in the rain and wind we walked the easy mile to \"coral\" beach. A beautiful walk. The \"coral\" is actually dried, calcified sea weed which we found interesting. Wear shoes that",
          "We always wanted to see what the fuss was about at this beach ... I looked it up and the pictures seemed amazing. Get to the car park. Which when we went it wasn't busy so plenty of space. Go through the gate ... better wearing wellies or something along those lines as the",
          "very accessible via car, ample parking and a mile walk gets you to this stunning location. Loved it.",
          "the walk to the beach is lovely, the beach is small but so nice. The views are amazing from the hill sited above the beach",
          "Not too widely advertised in the tourist blurb and situated in remote corner on northern Skye helps add to the mystique of this unique feature. Visited it ( for the fifth time) on September 13 the and it was as hauntingly beautiful as ever. It was a sunny evening and the sun was",
          "Park up if you can get a space it's very busy, walk along the tract through the gate and then there's the cows, if you're not bothered by them carry on over the fields which after rain are extremely boggy,then you come upon the coral beach it's like something out of the",
          "We'd visited Dunvegan Castle so it seemed a shame not to drive the extra 3 miles to Claigan. The car park is fairly small made much smaller by some pretty chaotic parking. The walk to the beach is a fairly easy 30 minutes each way. After heavy rain sections of the path were",
          "This is highly recommended place - it not worth to go so far. The parking is full, the way is easy but long and not interesting. The beach... well, possibly for north country it is exotic, but not worth spend day on Skye for it. The seals by the way to Claigan - are more",
          "After a ramble through the countryside on the coast you are presented with what looks like your walking into the mediterranian bay. It a must see if your by Dunvegan Castle",
          "If you want a pleasant walk along the shore (preferably on a sunny day) with some interesting vistas, this is an OK option. If you're looking for something truly out of the ordinary - forget it. The \"coral\" beaches may consist of unusual calcified seaweed, but essentially they",
          "On the windiest day of the trip, we arked up and walked to the Coral Beach. Ample off road parking...good planning Skye people. Follow the footpath and info signs down to the sea and then take the path to the headland. Amazing bays and then you happen upon the coral beach by the",
          "Short walk (c. 20 mins) from carpark to an interesting beach and beautiful clear sea. Good for a short visit on a sunny day.",
          "This is beautiful but there are no facilities which we realised but others didn't. This meant random toilet stops and dreadful parking making it difficult for others.",
          "Lovely beach with a great view. The water is crystal clear and the 'sand' white. Don't be deceived though. The sand is much more interesting than usual. Have a closer look! The walk to the beach is interesting especially when you have a mother cow watching your every move near",
          "It was a n half an hour walk from the parking to the Coral beach. But not worth it. Many yellow seaweed and a little stroke of white beach? We looked any further around the corner if the beach was there. But this was the only one.",
          "This was the easiest walk that we did in Skye. Spotted seals in the waters off the beach. Great views from the hill overlooking the beach",
          "Beautiful spot found after a walk along the coast and over a grass hill. Small parking area at the end of a single track road. Selfish camper van drivers seemed intent on blocking the roads and parking across several parking spaces. Stay away if you are driving a camper van.",
          "This one is nice but doesn't make it to my favorite sites in Skye. The walk there is very long, so my advice is reconsider if you're on a tight schedule. I don't quite understand what they mean by \"coral\"; I didn't exactly see any. But it's a beautiful beach and the cows nearby",
          "Love this place...have visited many times even with small children. Limited parking especially on a nice day but the walk is relatively flat and easy. Views are lovely. Good for a picnic. You need decent shoes.",
          "Don't be scared by the sign advising 45 minute walk there and 45 minute walk back. We did the whole thing in about 45 minutes. The coral beach is nice, but a lot of the beach had heavy sea weed on it. You could see nice clear beach, but you had to walk along a lot of not so",
          "The beach is a short and scenic drive past Dunvegan Castle on a typical single track road where seals can be easily viewed on the rocky shores to your left. There is a short walk of about a mile from the car park that can get a little boggy at times but when the beach opens up",
          "This is a fabulous place it is peaceful, tranquil and just beautiful. A place where you can sit and think, enjoy beautiful views. It is about a mile to walk to the beach and to get there you have to climb of a small incline of cliff and past the grazing cattle. Yes, it does",
          "The beach is a good 15-20 minute walk from the car park (if you can get parked!) but is worth it. Would I drive the 90 minutes from our accommodation to go again - no. Bear in mind the nearest facilities of any sort are back at Dunvegan Castle. It is a beautiful beach although",
          "The beach is a very long walk from the parking, and during that walk, it appeared like this beach might be a disappointment, but the sight of seals at the beach completely overshadowed everything! I was shrieking in delight when I saw the seals, and it was absolutely lovely.",
          "The coral beach is a small beach with white \"sand\" and pretty turquoise waters near the shore. Seals bob in the sea nearby. Whether the beach is worth the relatively long and windy drive to get there and the half-hour-plus walk in will largely depend on whether you have been",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a drive on the single track winding road. Limited parking on a nice day. And the walk I think was about ~2 miles to actually get out to coral beach. You walk through cattle pastures, mind the cows with calves! There are bunnies along the walk. It is steep in some",
          "Easy walk to the beach but we were there after some rain & it was very muddy. From Dunvegan Castle, continue towards Claigan for about 3 miles on the A850",
          "Not far from Dunvegan, Coral Beach is well worth a walk to. Lovely clear waters with seals playing just off the shore and some stunning scenery as well. There are opportunities to see other wildlife too. The beach stands out from the rest of the shoreline and information boards",
          "Just north of Dunvegan castle, it takes about a half hour to walk the path to the beach.There are no man-made structures along the way, so it's a very pleasant walk. Once there, my husband and I saw many rabbits pop up out of their burrows next to the coral beach. We also saw",
          "The \"sand\" is made up of teeny tiny pieces of ocean smoothed shells or coral. You'd need to be much braver than me to go swimming, but theoretically it's possible. The dunes behind the beach are home to bunnies! This would be a fun place to bring kids... lots of shells and",
          "I had the Coral Beach on my list of places to visit on Skye, but was a bit disappointed when I got there. It was a cloudy day, so the sand was not very vibrant, and the beach was much smaller than I thought it would be. It was still a very pleasant walk. (Make sure you follow",
          "It was about a 30 minute walk to get the the beach but well worth it. A beautiful coral beach set amongst the back drop of Scottish Mountains. We went late summer evening and were the last on the beach. We saw Seals playing along the shore line which was a real treat,",
          "It's a very pleasant short walk to the beach along a footpath following the shore. If you're lucky seals can be spotted along the way and the views at the end are beautiful. The small car park is reached at the end of the road a short drive beyond Dunvegan Castle.",
          "After spending a few hours at Luskentyre beach on Harris, which was incredibly beautiful, we didn't feel the need to go out of our way to visit more beaches. But this beach was on my list of things to see, and was near enough to our hotel in Glendale, so I thought it would have",
          "The views were outstanding which were helped by the seals playing just off shore. Nice easy walk with a great result",
          "While parking can be a bit of a problem during 'peak hours', it's worth sparing a couple of hours for this walk to burn off some calories. And if you are lucky and keep a bit of distance from the coast together with other fellow visitors, you might be able to see some sea lions.",
          "It's about a mile walk from where you park the car to the beach, but it was a nice walk. When you reach the beach it's truly beautiful. Crystal clear waters. White coral beach. It's like paradise. Myself and my 6yrs old daughter looked through the coral sand at all the detail",
          "We picked a warm and sunny day to visit this beach, and the 20 minute walk was definately worth while. It was almost like being on the Barrier Reef!",
          "It's a bit of a walk though fields (probably too far for young children) to this beautiful beach but it was definitely worth it. We were lucky that it was very sunny and it looked like a Caribbean beach!",
          "Since I'm from California I wasn't that excited at first glance, but once I saw the clear water and realized that the beach wasn't sand but in fact tiny coral and shells, I was really amazed. It was beautiful. We spent a couple of hours all together (walking and enjoying) and it",
          "Rather a let down really--went in the evening --quite busy --but not worth the visit--maybe we are spoilt in the North East of England--but hardly worth any comment--nice stroll there and back",
          "I would recommend a visit to Coral beach. It's a lovely relatively gentle walk through the fields to the beach and the coral is stunning. Best to visit on a bright sunny day as the water and coral just sparkle!",
          "We were told we just had to go here by people from Edinburgh. This might be an unusual and magical beach for folks who live where there aren't many of them, but for us, visitors from the east coast of the US who've visited many beaches in North America, this was pretty",
          "We skip Dunvegan castle, and headed to Coral Beach. The weather was not perfect, cloudy, light rain, but the atmosphere were magic. The girls loved that. Sand is not fine, but clear and water is literally transparent. We planned to spend one hour and ended up to stay more than 3",
          "A little tough to find (you have to go past Dunvegan Castle), but worth the trip. Car park is a little small, but fortunately for us was a good day to visit...only about a dozen other cars. I think it's closer to a 2 mile hike to get to the crescent beach, but it's a fairly easy",
          "Continue on A850 road which passes Dunvegan castle towards Claigan and you will pick up signs to the Coral Beach, the road narrows to a single track with passing places. Car parking is free, but the spaces do get taken very quickly so it might be an idea to arrive early. The",
          "This is a beautiful beach and only really a short and fairly easy walk from the parking spot. Fantastic clear water and a coral like sand(actually algae!) on a sunny day it could be somewhere tropical! If you are thinking it will be deserted, think again! Can get very busy and",
          "It is worth the walk to see this 'white' beach. managed to spot a seal which was a bonus for me. Free car park",
          "The car park is quite a far walk from the small stretch of beach. A nice walk though, on a sunny day. The views out onto the water are stunning.",
          "Visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon in early June. It was difficult to get parked but turnover of cars in the car park happens regularly. The walk to the beach was nice with seals swimming out in the bay. The water is very clear and my wife took a paddle. Climbed the small hill",
          "The walk down and back from the coral beach is relaxing and enjoyable, provided you have no difficulty with going up and down hills and don't mind hopping over small streams across stones. I'd recommend wearing proper walking shoes, and sun screen if you go on a sunny day like",
          "Having read some tripadvisor reviews we thought this might be a trek through tricky paths and streams, so we wore wellies and walking boots. But it was really a very easy, gentle stroll and having had dry weather the streams to cross were just trickles with easy stepping",
          "A must visit when visiting Skye! Spectacular scenery indeed. Ensure you have suitable footwear for walking as paths are rough and can be slippy especially when descending the hills if you have climbed them to get to advantage points!",
          "A lovely walk leads eventually to this beautiful beach which is an ideal place for a picnic or a paddle",
          "Islands, green pastures, blue and turquoise seas, coral sand beach, flowers, forever views...all make this a pretty walk. Nice days are, well, nicer, as the color pops.",
          "After braving the nightmarish car park on a hot sunny day (there isn't nearly enough parking, so lots of cars reversing out and trying to find somewhere to park...), it's about a 20 minute walk to the coral beach along an easy path. The beach is simply stunning, I spent some",
          "Not a deserted beach at may half term, but still stunning. Parking a bit limited, 20 minute easy walk. Would like to have had a wet suit to swim. Lovely place for a picnic",
          "A short easy walk of about 30 minutes each way and sea views with changing light and atmosphere. You don't see the beach until walking up a small hill, hidden from view you suddenly get your first glimpse of the beach at the crest of the hill and wow what a sight, the white",
          "What a hidden treasure this place is. Lovely walk and stunning views over the sea. Great place to see seals. Very relaxing. Love Coral Beach. Well worth a visit",
          "Well worth the short walk. The area is very clean and the water crystal clear. A gem of a location. Worth walking up to the point as Common Seals can be clearly seen on the small island opposite the beach.",
          "The hike to the beach is a bit long but the walk is easy. The beach can get busy so be prepared. We had a beautiful day with not a cloud in the sky. The water was extremely cold being from the states we are used to much warmer water. The beach is shells so they are not easy on",
          "Lovely walk, about 2 miles from the car park. Fairly deserted when we went. The beach is made up of coral and not sand. Lots of bird life and seals.",
          "Walked here twice over the two weeks we were on Skye, the first in gale force winds and rain and the second on a beautiful sunny day! It is well worth the walk and for a picnic when the weather allows! Look out for the seals basking in rocks on the little island opposite.",
          "A bery beautiful beach, crystal clear water and a nice walk with great views. But very very busy, lots of people there so not really a place to enjoy some peace and quiet.",
          "Park the car in the car park and take a short hike of about 40minutes each way to this amazing place. You take the first glimpse of it as you walk over a nearby hill. It takes your breath away as it is not what you would expect of a beach on the Isle of Skye. This was one of the",
          "We were advised by locals to visit this beach and we were so glad we did. The route is quite tough in parts, over ditches and through mud, so walking boots are needed. However, when you get your first glimpse of the coral beach you will be \"wowed\". It was also a bit windy when",
          "Not much car parking at the end of the track that leads to the two mile walk to the beach. A bit of a rough track to get to the coral beach but well worth the effort; stunning views and a coral beach at the end.",
          "Was a loverly walk out to the Coral Beach although a little windy it was nice to see and well worth visiting",
          "An exhilarating walk to a beautifil beach. Not easy terrain for buggies though. Well worth the walk.",
          "A Scottish beach at its best. The day we visited we were the only people there. If it is a good day go and watch the sun set. Utterly beautiful.",
          "Tranquil and beautiful place... You won't believe that you're still in Scotland!! (Until the breeze gives it away!)",
          "We were staying on Skye for our honeymoon and got told about a nice wee walk near Dunvegan which would take us to a coral beach - we thought it sounded like a good way to spend an afternoon..This ended up being the best day out we had on our 7 day break, the beach was stunning",
          "We travelled here on a very cold but sunny day and it was most bizarre looking at a beach that looks as though it belongs in the Caribbean?! I would most definitely visit here again on a warmer day.",
          "Short walk to a fantastic beach worth a visit especially on a sunny day. Saw some seals. Take a picnic and linger",
          "It s a realy confortable walk. In the end we even saw seals! They came very close to the beach..that was nice.. It was a little bit rainy so good shoes are really nescessary for this walk, but even in rain very nice...",
          "Well worth the walk. The pathway needs looking at though. It stops half way to the beach. After that it's a muddy quagmire. Parking is very restrictive. Perhaps a farmer could allow use of a small park. Best tip arrive early for parking",
          "The walk could be a little better as the pathway is boggy in places. The beach looks amazing when u finally get a glimpse after creasting a nearby hill. The water looks inviting. It certainly gives the legs a stretch off if you have been in the car a while.",
          "This is the third time I've been to coral beach so I'm undoubtably part of the problem... the beach is lovely though a million people walking every year has taken its toll on the landscape and the paths have eroded quite a bit which makes me a bit sad. I've been in the depths",
          "We almost skipped the Claigan Coral Beach on our road trip through Skye, as it's kind of a pain to get to. But we were SO glad that we went. It helped that we had a beautiful warm, clear March day! The views were stunning, and it was such a lovely walk down to the beach. Highly",
          "we did this walk at the end of the day, so we were slightly pushed for time .... i am not sure this really qualifies as a short walk - i estimate it took us a good hour to get to the beach while we ambled along. the path splits about 3/4 of the way - take the left path. lovely",
          "It's a bit of a trek from the car park. But boy is it worth it. Through the cattle gates, over the fields and pass the cows. Then over another hill. Take your walking shoes with you and make sure their waterproof. It's soooooo worth it. What a beautiful beach it is. If it was",
          "I would recommend visiting coral beach for anyone looking for a short, easy, peaceful walk. The beach at the end is spectacular both at low and high tide and can be appreciated in any weather. It is also a good location for a nice sunset.",
          "About 20 degrees from Paradise. Shortish walk to a peninsula but so worth it. Only the chill breeze reminding you that you are actually in the Hebrides. Beach is beautiful, as are the views, worth adding a bit of time to wander around and explore. Also if tide is out go",
          "I was very impressed with this spot of beach. It's not very big but it's chocked full of tiny pieces of coral and shells. Great for a bit of walking. Would not recommend heading back through the bog heath and bracken unless you want to explore the croft ruins.",
          "Coral Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach with clear turquoise water and amazing scenery surrounding the location. It's about a mile walk from the car park which can be quite muddy so wear suitable footwear. It's an easy walk though with only gentle slopes and tiny burns to",
          "Unfortunately, we went on a windy day but it was still quite sunny so we made the trek to the quite remote coral beach. It is a good hike to get there but the kids (2 yr and 6 yr) managed it fine and it is quite easy to walk. We took lunch and drinks and had it on the beach. I",
          "Water is crystal clear here, and the views are stunning. We went at sunset which made it all the more beautiful.",
          "It's a meandering walk to the beach but worth it. Bluey green seas surrounded by beach and diverse coastal life. Look out for the otters watching from the water!",
          "Another get there early recommendation...you will have the place to yourself hopefully, as we did. Lovely un-taking walk, beach is lovely, water so clear. Spotted some seals frolicking...just lovely.",
          "Beautiful place, best on a good day for full results. About a mile walk to the site, it's a nice walk too.",
          "a two mile easy walk leads you to a small sandy beach with small but steep hills to climb to enjoy the scenery further. We could see seals playing in the kelp. A beautiful place to relax or picnic!",
          "This is just another piece of paradise in a huge jigsaw puzzle of beaches. Every one slightly different to the last one.",
          "This really is an amazing little beach with some incredible views. It's a nice walk, especially when you can catch a bit of sun, but it does get muddy and slippery at parts if it's been raining. I could have stayed here for much longer than we did just taking it all in!",
          "Stunning beach. It's and interesting walk from the carpark as it isn't signposted on the way but if you keep walking along to the first beach (with grey stones) until you see an opening in the dry stone dyke (wall), go through it and over the brow of the hill and you will see",
          "So after seeing the pictures of the beach online it was a must see and we weren't disappointed. Walk 1km to a rocky beach camas then walk towards the gap in the old wall over the hill is the sandy coral beach.",
          "Lovely place to walk....better when the tide is out, as you have access to another part. A perfect place to walk the dog, have a picnic and just enjoy.",
          "This is a short walk for a leg-rest day along a beach, low rises and views across the loch and ocean. Very pleasant.",
          "This is a very nice walk and at the end of it you arrive at an extremely beautiful white sand beach. There are many and varied walks on Skye and this one although not long and taxing is certainly well worth doing.",
          "Great beach to take dogs for a walk. Quite a few people there (car park vey busy) but it still seemed remote. Lovely location well worth a visit.",
          "We're very lucky to have a glorious sunny October day to take the walk out to the coral beach. It's about a mile from the car park and you'll need decent footwear. The beach itself was stunning and the vies were amazing.",
          "Just a short walk from the car park to a small photogenic beach. We were lucky enough to see seals basking at its furthest point. I would recommend visiting early as it's very popular and parking is limited.",
          "The real adventure at this beach is probably the drive to the car park area! Seriously though, this is a great little walk over rutted tracks and some sheep trails to a quite beautiful curved beach rich in white coral. There are many good vantage points for photos. In the late",
          "This is not a very long or difficult walk, but is well worth the treacherous drive to the walk entrance. After a short distance you ll find some local cows that enjoy sleeping on the gorgeous sand. Definitely worth checking out!",
          "You need to go out your way to find this,but it is so worth it! A bit of a rough track to walk along,but the scenery does not disappoint.So worth it when you come over the brake,even on a dull day.The water is turquoise and the sand illuminates even on a rainy day. Will",
          "We were at Dunvegan Castle and the lady working there told us the beach was just a couple miles (4) down the road. So we drove down there - the road was narrow and only allowed for 1 car at a time and took a while. Once we got there the sign at the parking lot said (i believe)",
          "This is a lovely site but only one beach was as advertised, the other was covered in stones & sea-weed, which I know can't be helped, but didn't quite have the Wow factor I was expecting. It was a lovely day though, with a very low tide following the blood moon event, so several",
          "Easy walk fairly flat for some one unfit like me. Unusual nature of the beach worth exploring. Watch out for the tide coming in as some others got caught out by the little island created.",
          "To get there , go straight past Dunvegan castle , and your now on the one track road , follow this for a good ten minutes and you come to a dead end , now the walk begins , its a good few miles , but worth it , on your way you will see gannets and other sea birds , as you climb",
          "A lovely little walk with spectacular scenery. We were lucky when we visited that the tide was low so we were able to walk across to a little island. The Coral beach is beautiful and white. Alt hour this isn't true coral, but in fact the remains of seaweed",
          "The beach is beautiful and offers a nice view of the surrounding loch. It's a total change of scenery compared to the usual cliffs on Isle of Skye.",
          "We visited Coral Beach on a dry day and although it had been raining heavily the previous day the approach lane was not all sludgy as we expected. There's a free car parking area with limited spaces. It's about a two mile walk on an uneven dirt track to the beach. When we were",
          "Who would have believed you would see a coral beach on Skye! A two mile walk from the car park at the end of the road several miles past the entrance to Dunvegan castle is worth every step. The amazing colours of the water and the coral make it seem as if you are in the",
          "We were lucky enough to visit the beach on a wonderful sunny day. The views were out of this world! The beach is crystal clear blue! There were some daredevils brave enough who actually took a swim in the water...but not for the weak of heart!",
          "Lovely place - pure water, clean beach, fabulous views around - takes about 10 minutes nice walk from the car park",
          "This used to be a very much unknown part of the island but it's now on the standard tourist \"circuit\". If you want solitude, best plan to get here early or very late. It's a very pretty wee spot though and you can spend hours checking out the wee \"coral\" pieces on the beach,",
          "We did the drive and then hike along the coast to see the coral beaches, but unfortunately got caught in a passing shower and were drenched to the skin, even though we had come with waterproof coats! Even so, the beach is very impressive, if a little small.",
          "Be prepared to walk. You will be parking the car and from there you can walk up to coral beach. It is a very nice beach with view on the Little Minch",
          "It's hard to know what to expect when you are walking to this place - the walk is about 40 minutes, and you cant see the beach till the end, but the beach itself is completely worth it. Its fascinating from a biological perspective due to the seaweed skeletons, but also",
          "After leaving the car it's quite a walk on a stony path and through fields which for us were a bit muddy ( so wear sensible footwear ) but nothing prepares you for the sight that greets you as you stagger up the last rise. Dazzling white sand and turquoise water - even caused my",
          "Nice quite beach with lovely coral sand. Our dog loved it. A nice walk to get there, can be muddy in places.",
          "After a passing Dunvegan castle, carry on down the road for about 15 mins. The car park is small, not big enough for demand but the beach itself is worth the hassle. Lovely walk down to the beach, pushchair accessible too. There are cows roaming free, which added to the",
          "We were lucky enough to visit on a beautiful, sunny morning and were the first to arrive that day. So early, in fact, that rabbits were still playing on the sand. We had attempted to visit the day before and drove for some distance past Dunvegan castle, on a single track road",
          "1 of the most stunning beaches I have ever seen!! Beautiful walk down to the beach!! Water is crystal clear!! Tricky place to find but well worth it!!",
          "We cycled from Dunvagen and then along the track to the beach. A lovely half day out and the sea is crystal clear with seals on the island off shore and in the sea. Popular but not busy and folk were swimming despite the weather",
          "Stunning views. A good 20 min walk from the car park (little ones may want a lift on your shoulders).",
          "Been many times before and still as lovely as ever, even though the weather was not great, it was still very busy.",
          "If you like peace and tranquility and pretty countryside and beaches then this is for you. Well worth the short walk on a nice day - perhaps take a picnic",
          "Busy location but worth visiting. Nice walk from the car park, toward the beach with fantastic views over the water and to the rest of the island as well.",
          "Lovely walk to stunning beach of white sand and crystal clear water. Be careful not to stop at the first patch of sand, keep going. See cows grazing on the beach.",
          "A lovely walk for about a mile along tracks, then a white beach and clear blue sea comes into view. There's a great viewpoint of the beach and surrounding mountains up a little hill. Well worth a visit.",
          "So beautiful. There is a bit of a walk in. At first the beach is grey, keep walking! I had my swimming costume but did not go in. Next time l will bring a wetsuit. The white coral isn't too sharp on the feet. I could have stared at the clear water all day!",
          "A very pleasant walk if not raining. Nice views across the loch. If there has been rain, part of the track can be very boggy, you will need to take a wider path in that case. Some of the path is a little steep and rocky so not great for the less mobile. I did see a lady with",
          "As we had very limited time on the island, I went online to search the Top 10 attractions to visit and Coral beach was one of them. Its location was very out of the way and we thought it would have worth the effort if it was as nice as what the websites had portrayed. We saw",
          "We were lucky that we day we choose to walk to the beach was warm and sunny - the walk was very enjoyable and although it was the first week of July the route wasn't too busy, beautiful sea views and of course the beach is just stunning :-)",
          "Despite being wet, cloudy and very windy this was a lovely walk with stunning views and amazing beaches, we had our dog on a lead, cattle were in the distance but do be aware of the livestock.",
          "It's a long, but relatively easy walk out to the beach. You walk through farm fields with the cows. There were even cows on the beach! The beach itself is small and not particularly attractive, but the views on the way are fabulous.",
          "This beach is defo a marvel! We could even spot some seals playing and swimming around the edges of the water. We camped near there for a night in June last month. It was very windy and it's hard to set up the tent at first but we found a spot by the wall and it was perfect.",
          "About a mile walk down to the beach. Suitable for young kids if you have the time to walk with them. Beach made of crushed shells and when the sun shines on it you would think you were on a tropical island.",
          "Glorious sunny day when we visited, around a mile and a half circular walk back to the car park. Another popular place, car gets full even late in the afternoon, .... Out of season!. Worth a visit, but like so many places on skye, loads of people! The beaches themselves were",
          "We were told we HAD to go to this beach. Coming from the Isle of Wight we know beaches. This was lovely but as we drove around north Scotland we saw large and more beautiful remote beaches so felt this was slightly over rated. It is however a very special place.",
          "Went here in April during an Easter break, pretty much by accident. Only carried on up the road because we couldn't get to Dunvegan castle. To begin there is a beach where you can see plenty of seal heads bobbing along in the water. Walking up past that you get a great view over",
          "Visited here on a lovely sunny day. Not too far a walk to get to the beach from the car park, just over a mile. Any young children would have to be carried in a sling though as there isn't a path and there's a couple of river crossings. Beach is amazing and the grassy embankment",
          "Lovely long walk to get to coral beach from car park but bitterly disappointed with the hype. Not what we were expecting at all",
          "Headed here for a morning walk with the dogs. We all loved it. Keep dogs on leads near the cows but on the beach ours loved running around, in and out of the sea. We had a visit from some seals which topped it for us. Just a beautiful beach, if it was sunny we'd definitely have",
          "We enjoyed the walk ( 10 - 15 minutes) to the beach. The parking is a bit crazy. We parked down the road a bit and pointed the car to go out to make it easier to leave. The beach has crushed coral and interesting shells. Worth a visit if close by!",
          "Quite a walk to get to the beach which wasn't well sign posted, so we asked a local resident if we were on the right track to the car park. From the car park it was a pleasant walk and the beach itself was lovely. It was a shame the weather was against us as I don't feel we",
          "It's a bit of a walk into but is relatively flat the whole way and the views during the walk are stunning. The coral beaches themselves look like they belong in the Caribbean had it not been for the beautiful cliff faces and green hills surrounding them. This was a great way to",
          "Amazing beach, blue sky, white coral sand, seal and dolphins spotted from the beach. Shame it wasn't a hot sunny day or I would have been there all day, short walk to the car park too.",
          "Lovely walk down a track and opens up to a unexpected Beautiful white coral beach with outstanding views very easy to beleive your elsewhere unless you dip your feet in the sea :)",
          "fantastic golden white sandy coral beach stretching for hundreds of yards amongst the granite outcrops in the north east of Skye. You will see more seals than humans, its very godd and a healthy walk from civilisation!",
          "First of all, on your journey down the goat path road so common in this area, if you look out the window towards the water you will see seals bathing in the sunlight on the rocks. Once you reach the parking lot its a bit of a walk, 2 ish km, but worth the trek. really",
          "This is a very gentle walk a bit blustery but lovely we always return when visiting skye. Mant shells on the beach very interesting views well worth the visit.",
          "Lovely beach just amazing. You park at the end of the road and follow the track along the beach. When the track starts going up the hill go for the track on the left through the stone wall you will soon see the beach although a little wet at the top of the hill.",
          "This place is worth a visit! It has a special ambiance. The beach is white and the sea deep blue and turquoise. During low tide you can take a walk to the small island or climb a little cliff beside the beach (behind the hill), where you have your privat viewpoint.",
          "It said on the sign before you start that the walk is a mile but it's a lot further than that. It wasn't a great day and the fog covered the beach but it was still really nice. The beach is made up of little bits of 'coral' which was really cool and the water was so clear. Would",
          "If you like quiet beaches, with sparkling clear water then Coral Beach is a must while on Skye. When we visited last week, the weather was gorgeous and sunny - the water at Coral beach was soooo inviting that I had to have a paddle - of course it was freezing cold!! We had",
          "Our young family easily made the walk, and despite the squalling downpours had a great day out. This is an easy walk, although not a smooth or flat track at all, and well worth the effort. Take a walk, and a kite... great fun.",
          "When Googling the places to visit in Isle of Skye I stumbled upon this very interesting coral beach. Since it is not far away from Dunvegan castle we have decided to visit it as well and I am glad we did. Have your expectations adjusted: it is few miles on this rural one lane",
          "We visited the beach in March, the weather wasn't great so we opted for a short walk in between showers. Easy walking and fantastic views, I'd highly recommend it! X",
          "21 March found this amazing place. Arrived early very quiet only two cars in the car park. Lovely walk spectacular views, at about 1030 the tide started to go out and within mains was able to walk across to the island. Found a sea urchin and walked around taking the most breath",
          "We really enjoyed spending a couple of hours at this beach, we arrived there late in the afternoon, so it was pretty quiet :-) The coral beach is lovely & the water so clear! There were 4 or 5 seals playing close to shore too",
          "Walk felt more than a mile but that was ok. It's a beach and probably one of the nicest on Skye but not one I would want to walk barefoot on or sunbathe on. Lovely views across to Hallin etc",
          "I have been to Skye many times and always enjoy the gentle stroll to Coral beach. This was the first time my fianc\u00e9e had been to Skye and she really loved Coral beach. The thing I love about it so much is the way in which it appears almost from nowhere as you wander over the",
          "Coral beach is a wonderful place reminding of the carribean. So if the weather is nasty, it gives an starkling contrast - blue water and a white beach (neither sand nor coral but algea shells). Our kids really loved it and the hike is so easy through flat, although occasionally",
          "We just wanted to enjoy some nature and quietness in Scotland, and Coral Beach was the PERFECT place for a realxing (and a little exercise). You can simply walk along the beach, or climb a bit more for a better view. Apparently you can see seals sometimes from here. This was",
          "My experience at Claigan Coral Beach is perhaps not very useful for the majority of travellers as I went in the middle of January. The rain was horizontal and painful. That said, the views were stunning and the landscape breathtaking. Well worth the torturous weather. The",
          "We usually go for much longer walks, but this wee gems was our 'before breakfast' starter one autumn day- we were so glad we did! An easy walk to a wonderful beach with strange white mearl sand- the water so clear and blue it looks tropical. ON this still day we couldn't resist",
          "No parking charges, good footpath and wonderful scenery. What more could you ask for? How about lovely sunshine, crystal clear water, seals, plenty of bird life and a dog otter making his way along the shoreline? All this was at the end of November. The walk to Coral",
          "This is an easy walk to the beach, about 3 miles there and back from the car park. Not strenuous although wear decent footwear. The reward at the end is a beach the Caribbean would be proud of. White sand, clear blue waters and, if you are lucky, you might catch sight of seals",
          "We walked from Dunvegan to Coral Beach it is a bit of a walk took us all day there and back however it was worth the walk, you can drive aling there is a reasonable car park, it was beautiful you just would not expect to see something so nice in a remote part of Skye. The views",
          "Amazing, peaceful and beautiful. Highly recommended. Easy to find too. Clear sea with plenty of photo opportunities. Go go go!",
          "A lovely little beach about a mile from the car park. Worth a walk even in gale force winds. You need decent footwear.",
          "Coral Beach is about four miles north of Dunvegan. Drive past the Castle until you come to a T junction with a small sign and turn left into a small parking area. Parking is limited to about 20 cars. There is a 20 minute walk down to the beach mostly on trails but it may be",
          "Quite simply a stunning beach with beautiful, clear water. We were lucky enough to visit when the sun was shining and the views all around were fantastic. A fairly easy walk from the car park, even with young children",
          "We went here yesterday and enjoyed the mile walk from the car park, along the coast to the beach. You drive past Dunvegan Castle for another 5-10mind until you come to the sign \"Coral Beach\" you park and it took us roughly half an hour to get to. We had a 2yr old and 5 yr old so",
          "The walk is worth the view of the black and white caribean beach with clear water. If you're lucky you can meet the cows lying in the sand - be careful, they don't like tourists so much.",
          "An amazing find and certainly a place to head for after a tour of Dunvegan Castle. It's just a few miles passed the Castle down a single tracked road (fortunately with passing places!). We took our hired Scottish Tourers Motorhome down this road and found there was parking at",
          "Fairly long walk there, but the views make it worth it. Weather was mad on the day we went, sun, rain, wind then more sun. It's a beautiful place with lots of jelly fish. Beach full of bones. Like a fish grave yard.",
          "As you approach the first beach you can see the second white beach in the distance and is a great photo opportunity. The day we travelled there, we were fortunate to have lovely weather, we enjoyed a picnic and collected some wonderful shells. It is fascinating to think the sand",
          "A dodgy single track road runs down to a grassy car park affair which was chaos, bit of a free for all, that may well have been because everyone got up and decided to visit the beach at the same time, buses, camper vans on single track roads not a good combination, we were ok as",
          "A fine walk along this part of Skye. Don't stop at the first beach as its beyond that. Plenty to collect and great fresh air!",
          "We were planning an outdoor swim the next day with a group and so walked in late evening and found a place to pitch out tent above the waterline in the meadow. A very quiet night's sleep and a lovely start to the next day. Parking was easy as we were the only ones there, but",
          "It was quite fun to reach Claigan Coral Beach.First the road leading to this place had just the width of one car, but people were driving from both directions. Luckily there were numerous \"passing spots\", where one car stopped to let the other car from the other direction bypass",
          "Another must see on Skye. It's a pleasant, easy walk along to the beach which is stunningly beautiful. We met a few friendly local people and tourists along the way and one or two not quite so friendly cows!! Remember to take your camera - you'll be glad you did!",
          "After a walk through a green landscape, which reminded me of Austria, we reached the beach. It was great to stay there for a whie and enjoy the white coral.",
          "A beautiful beach. Never been to a coral beach before. A bit of a walk from the car park but enjoyed the stroll because of the nice weather and breezy wind. Didn't get to see seals as mentioned by other reviewers. Stunning beach nonetheless!",
          "Definitely take the walk to Coral beach. It is a wonderful surprise to see this white beach and crystal clear, green water!",
          "The drive there is down quite narrow roads to a small car park (arrive early in the morning). The walk is very pleasant and quite easy under foot. The views are amazing, the water is so clear and blue/green and the beach just beautiful. A stunning location to take photos.",
          "Went to the coral beach n a lovely, sunny September day and it was just like being on a Caribbean beach. It is a little difficult to find....stay on the road past Dunvegan Castle and you will eventually find the small parking area. Then there is a mile or so walk to reach the",
          "well worth the walk to the beach through fields Plenty of photo opportunities ideal place for families Watching seals on island opposite plenty of sea life",
          "Don't expect a beach for sunbathing on with seaside bars etc, but for wonderful views and a small beach made up of crushed coral as very intestine to see. About a mile walk across mainly farmland (mind the bulls) from a very small car park area. Certainly worth a visit and no",
          "A bit of a trek but well worth it, very beautiful aqua water and white coral beach (when the sun is shining).",
          "Worth going ten miles out of your way for but you will need more than this to make a real day out of it. Great views towards Uig if you walk on from the beach to the headland.",
          "A beautiful site, lovely walk, in nature, along the coast of Skye, beaches formed from tiny pieces of old coral, other adjacent beaches of stone, water crystal clear, hills, craggy tors, cows grazing and lolling about. In August a good deal of people trekking through the only",
          "Well worth a visit - lovely stroll to the beach from the car park, and very beautiful once you're there.",
          "Sadly, I let the hype get to me - beaches.co.uk had it ranked as the 8th best beach in the world. Sure don't get me wrong it is beautiful, wild, rugged, unique (for the area) and well worth going with a picnic. There's a lovely seal colony on the adjacent island, walks are great",
          "The coral beach is very beautiful and certainly something unique on the island. Skye isn't known for vast sandy beaches, like many of the other islands, but the coral beaches are a little treat when you get to them. It's a bit of a walk, which is tricky with a toddler (our fault",

          "We spent a glorious sunny day here, took a picnic, paddled in the crystal clear water and played on the beach and the surrounding grass areas. Would recommend for a chilled out summers day. It is a bit of a walk from the car park, but I visited with young children and elderly",
          "We recently visited this attraction on a warm sunny day in June. It\u2019s an amazing place to visit and an idyllic spot to rest and relax. From the car park there is a walk of about two miles to reach the Coral Beach. It is a lovely place to sit and watch the sea and enjoy a picnic",
          "We took the 20-minute walk with our 16-month old baby in a pram with large wheels. We had to lift the pram over a gate once, but it was sooo worth it. Stunning beach!",
          "Lovely stroll to the beach. The sun was shining and the water was crystal clear. Would recommend this.",
          "After a drive along a single track road and no real signs we found the car park and walked along a path, rocky in places but well marked out. Over the hill and you're transported to what looks like a paradise beach. Finely crushed shells and beautiful clear water. Well worth the",
          "after pleasant walk you come to a an amazing coral beach. just an amazing place you can also get great views of seals",
          "On a trip to the coral beach we were lucky enough to go on a really nice warm sunny day, yes they do happen on Skye. The walk was nice and once at the beach you could easily have been somewhere exotic and abroad. The water was lovely and blue and the beach shone in the sun.",
          "My mum comes from Skye, I've holidayed here for years! BUT!? Why have I never known about this place?! WOW!! It's a wee bit of a walk, but it's worth every step. The colours are truly beautiful. The beach is made up of mostly small pieces of coral, but there are a few big",
          "Good parking facilities. Easily accessible. Beautiful coral beach. Fascinating to watch the playful seals",
          "Have been to isle of Skye a few times but have never been here. On a summers day it's a real eye opener as you wouldn't expect to find something like this here. Bit of a stroll to get there and parking interesting if you don't get there early. Well worth it if the sun is shining.",
          "The walk to the Coral Beach was on a good path and had some very pretty views. The white of the beach and the very blue of the sea made you feel there was a touch of the tropics in the air (despite the grey cloud). Keep an eye on the cows, they were very picturesque but could",
          "Sorry to be pedantic, but this lovely and unique beach is NOT made up of broken shells (unlike other white beaches in other parts of the Hebrides), but is actually bleached coralline algae (hence the name Coral Beach), as the information boards at the car park explain, which is",
          "You might think us insane for negotiating this 1 mile walk across fields and some stoney paths with a wheelchair, but if you have read any of my other reviews, you will see that this is a family that will rise to the challenge if we think it's worth it - it was very much worth",
          "Always worth a visit just to sit and watch the birds or maybe an otter if lucky, most people pay a flying visit but it's a real chill out corner, don't rush",
          "Easy to find - go past Dunvegan Castle and follow the sign for Claigan - single track with passing places. At the end of the track, park your car and walk the 1m or so to the beach. You must keep dogs on a lead as cattle graze here. Rubbish bins located at the 'car park'. Ground",
          "It was a fantastic drive on the small road. The drive towards the beach was awesome. It was a pleasant walk to the beach with awesome views. Had a 2-3 hours nice time. The place was calm, natural. This place is perfect for being in a place where it is completely natural, open",
          "Wow, what a beach, visited early one evening, beautiful then, must be stunning in bright sunshine. Worth the climb up the hill for a great view",
          "This is a very pleasant walk, not at all difficult, and has wonderful views of the coastline. As you get nearer the Coral Beach it appears as a beautiful white bay in the distance. The beach is not actually sand but very small fragments of shell.",
          "Lovely walk and delightful first views of white beach. It was a beautiful day, and the colours of the sea were startling. Great place to explore, very pleasant short walk, and we wished we'd brought a picnic. Skye coast and views at their best.",
          "A 30 min/1 mile easy walk from the carpark to the beach - not too difficult for our little children. Looked like a sandy beach with clear waters, but as pointed out elsewhere, the 'sand' isn't sand. Lovely and quiet, nevertheless. We saw plenty of different coastal birds",
          "The most beautiful place I have been. Clear water and coral white beach are a must see. It is easy to see seals from the beach which was a real treat. About a 15 min walk but on a good pathway and totally worth it if you are able. The highlight of our trip to skye.",
          "A longer walk than the expected mile from the car park, but certainly worth the walk! A stunningly beautiful beach on the northern end of Skye. Enjoy the fresh air and quiet!",
          "After about a miles walk from the end of the road you arrive at a lovely white beach made up of tiny bits of coral and shells, it is a lovely place.",
          "A gorgeous little beach overlooking lovely coastal panorama. This is just typical scottish west coast stunning!",
          "Easy walk to a beautiful beach and fantastic views of the islands. The water may be cool but the beach is beautiful",
          "We visited coral beach on a beautiful march day. It was around 16 degrees and pure sunshine. After a lovely walk that was around half an hour at a leisurely pace from the car park, we arrived on the beach and if we hadn't known where we were we could have been forgiven for",
          "Lovely beach, well worth the one mile walk from the parking. We went late evening and the light and views were amazing. We saw quite a few seals on our walk back too.",
          "We were really surprised with the beauty of the coral beach - after a short walk we found the beach which was really beautiful - and the coral really shone brightly in the sunshine, even if only for a few minutes ! Worth a visit and good for photos",
          "the car park is very small....blink and you'll miss it! The walk through lovely woodland down to the shore is very pretty (remember your walking boots as it gets a bit rough)....you need to remember to fork right near to the end of the walk or you'll miss the coral beach",
          "Beautiful! Well worth the trek.take outdoor clothes and boots as it is muddy in places. And a camera. Awesome.",
          "Rugged wild and very, very beautiful - a must. In February you can expect to need good footwear, windproof coat, hat gloves and thermals.... worth every minute! A lovely walk - make the effort to walk right onto the headland for some spectacular views!",
          "lovely beach! only missing some palm trees and tropical fruits. the waters look very inviting, I'd jump in if only it wasn't 4\u00baC(the water's probably sub zero!). like in most of Skye, access to this place is only possible by car or bike. I don't think there are buses going this",
          "This place goes to show you that you do not have to go to Barbados to see stunning beaches. We took our three dogs and they loved it and we had a fantastic picnic watching the wildlife - including a Sea Eagle!! The seals were all relaxed and it is so tranquil. There is a slight",
          "Drive past Dunvegan castle to get here; small car park at start of the walk. A fairly easy walk, passing the small beach at Camas Ban. then on to through the wall to the Coral beach which is just stunning. Not actually coral but made of dessicated and sun-bleached calcified sea",
          "Headed down here after a lovely days walking for the sunset. It was amazing. Lovely spot. A bit of a windy drive to get here but a short 15 man walk from the car park is well rewarded by white sand, clear blue water and a beautiful sunset if you time it right.",
          "Just a fairly, short easy walk from the car park to come across these wonderful white beaches. Not sand, but a skeletal seaweed. It was a lovely sunny day when we went and the sea was as clear and blue as any Caribbean sea. Water was a little colder, but once in it was",
          "Well worth the mile walk from the car park. We were able to sit on the beach n the kids paddled like they were in the caribbean!!!a great free way to enjoy skye!",
          "A lovely walk from a small car parking area, not a difficult walk at all - although ground was soggy/muddy when we visited due to rainfall. The coral beach is beautiful, well worth a visit - you can climb up a small hill at the beach to get better views of the coastline and",

          "Been here 5 times before but this was definitely the best. The tide was almost fully in and because it was sunny, the Coral sand looked really White, hope it shows in the photo. You won't see the Beach from the Car Park (which can get busy) so if you're in a wheel chair, you",
          "This beautiful beach is just past Dunvegan Castle, and is about a 20-30 minute walk from the car park.This is one of those walks that keeps you guessing at every hill and corner that you turn when will you see this stunning beach!Well worth the visit even in a 'challenging' head",
          "It is past Dunvegan Castle. Keep driving and you will see a car park on the left eventually. 15 minutes? It's a pleasant walk in any weather. It was lovely to see, uncrowded. A nice addition to your days events.",
          "As per title, this place is almost like a tiny oasis at the end of a stretch of grasslands. Not to mention the number of cattle along the way glaring at you as you walk pass which casually open their bowels at free will. Definitely worth a visit in my opinion. Hope to visit",
          "The hike out to the coral beach passes through a sheep paddock, so watch your step! It was an easy walk, though. The beach itself isn't that special, but the view of the surrounding waters from the hill overlooking was.",

          "It is an unexpected white coral beach in an austere Scottish landscape. Flat walk to the beach. I would recommend this",
          "This is a lovely little beach, easily accessible. I'm sure it would be lovely for a swim if you get warm enough weather. It is great for beach combing and it is well worth climbing the small hill for great views.",
          "One of the reasons my son and myself came to skye was for the attractions and this didn't disappoint. Travel past dunvegan castle for two to three miles on the windy road(it looks like it leads to nowhere) and the car park appears on your left. It's then a good miles walk to the",
          "This coral beach is one more bountious beautiful experience on this treasure of an island. Take swimming gear and water booties with you. The soft lapping of the sea is enough to entice you in. Just savour the swim and walk back to your car. Breathtakingly beautiful.",
          "Claigan coral beach is absolutely special. You can run around the beach barefoot, with the coral between your toes. This is a great place for families because of the wonderful multicoloured shells, ranging from black and sea blue, to purple and light pink. There are cows along",
          "This beach is absolutely amazing, as everything that looks like white sand is corals only. If you are as lucky as we have been you might even see seals just 20-50m from the shore :-)",
          "We didn't know what to expect when we parked up and made the walk (around a mile) to the coral beach over grass and stones. It is beautiful when you arrive to a stunning white beach and clear water. We had the added bonus of cows chilling on the beach! To get there you just",

          "I had seen rather vague descriptions of this walk and I was not quite sure what to expect but I was happy that I decided to do this walk. The first half of the trip to the beach is fairly uneventful as you walk parallel to a fairly ordinary beach. When you reach the coral",

          "On a dampish day we trudged to Coral Beach the walk taking around 20 minutes. When we arrived at the beach it was a bit disappointing- yes it was white from the crushed shells but that was about it. We did see a couple of seals on the way back which brightened up the walk",
          "Our best trip of the week (as voted for by the children). Stunning scenery, clear waters and a herd of cows on the beach! What more could you ask for?",

          "This is a great gem hidden off on Skye. Yes, it is a bit of a hike- make sure you have rain gear with you (you should be keeping it with you at all times anyway, you are in Scotland!) and have firm supportive shoes. The \"trail\" to the coral beach starts at the end of the car",
          "While the views along the way were great, the 30 minute hike to the beach may have been a little steep for the small reward. The beach was not as I had expected and was a little let down by it. Great for dogs though.",
          "Its a must visit - it catpures the full romance of the Island of Skye and is vortually desserted. The coastline is stunning and kit feels as if you have the coral beach all to yourself.",

          "Quite a long walk to get there but worth it to see the lovely stretch of beach with the rugged shore line,we did not see any of the seals basking on the rocks but the brisk breeze ensured the cob webs were blown away.",
          "a small beach that stands out and reveals itself between 2 grassy hills. A nice 1h30 return walk. If you're lucky you might get a bit of sun :)",
          "We got wet and muddy but we didn't care, as the wildlife made up for it! We saw a Sea eagle, two golden eagles and loads of seals bobbing around in the bay. The dogs enjoyed a swim and we loved the views. A pleasant walk, lots of people around as it is so popular.",
          "Driving a one lane road with passing sites while acclimating to motoring on the left side of the road made our trip to the Coral Beach even more charming. Passing crofts while avoiding sheep along the road the walk to coral beach was delightful. An easy path through pasture land",
          "This is an easy walk reached via a fantastic drive from Dunvegan. The walk is mainly along a path before crossing grassland (which can be a little wet) to reach the first of the coral beaches but keep going until you get to the main one. It's worth going up the hill behind",
          "This is s lovely steady walk with gorgeous views over dunvegan loch, and a stunning view of the castle on the way back to the town. When you get to the beach, if the tide is out you can walk to a small island there. The beach itself is full of shells and the occasionsl fossil,",

          "Car park was nearly full (20+ cars) when we arrived mid-afternoon. A mile easy walk brins you to the 'coral' beach. The 'coral' is actually desicated broken pieces of calciferous seaweed. You'll find bigger bits on the tide-lines. (A similar beach is visible during the last",

          "we went on past Dunvagan Castle to get to the car park for the one and a half mile walk to discover the beach, the path is ok in the dry it could be a bit slippy if it had been wet, after walking for a while you come across a beach and feel a bit let down looking at the beach",
          "well worth the walk, about 2 miles from the car park, so a 4 mile round trip (roughly), good paths, easy walking, make sure you go past the first small beach, over the hill and when the next beach comes into sight it is just stunning, could be somewhere in the Caribbean, crystal",

          "Well worth the drive past Dunvegan to get here. On yet another changeable weather day on Skye we managed to have most of our visit in the dry and some sunshine. Although the small car park was full (might be a problem in summer?) the area didn't seem busy. After a pleasant",
          "The Coral Beach is small but lovely and we had it to ourselves for a while one Sunday afternoon in November. Beautiful white sand beach, tranquil spot and easy walk to get there. We saw seals bobbing up and down in the bay. Very different scenery to the rest of Skye so a must.",

          "It had just started to rain as we left for the 20 - 30 minute walk along the coastline to the coral beach. Having read the reviews on here and seen some articles in local leaflets etc we still thought it worth the walk. We went with a 3 year old and a teenager. The walk itself,"

Be wary that you park around mile from Coral beach and there isn't really that much parking here. On a cold rainy day, wrap up as theres not much shelter, but it's worth the walk to the beach.",

It\u2019s about a 20-25 minutes easy walk from the car parking but the views at the end are truly worth it, especially better if it\u2019s a clear day and you can look at the mountains far far away. Can be combined with a visit to the Dunvegan Castle.",

(Around 20+ min) and is very Rocky but at the end there is a nice beach where you can relax when the weather is nice. One bad point is that there are not many parking spaces and they are very narrow.",

A nice walk to a beautiful view. \n\nThe parking lot is very small so try not to being your giant RVs as you may get stuck and have a lot of angry motorists glaring at you, which is what we saw when we visited. Be prepared to wait for a spot also during the busy months.",

          "Kilt Rock was a wonderful place to visit in Scotland. The view is simply breathtaking and you can see the endless ocean far away. One's can only imagine living nearby. However it was extremely windy and cold as hell. the guide told us that the weather changes a lot anytime",
          "This was one of my favorite places to visit on the Isle of Skye. The clear water and green hills are exactly how I pictured Scotland to be. Listening to the waterfall was very peaceful! There was a young Scotsman playing the bagpipes, it even added more to the ambience. It was",
          "lovely place and an excellent view after stopping for sum fish and chips on the way up after the isle of skye bridge.",
          "My partner and I came onto Skye as part of a little escape trip.. But as with all things \"if it can hit the fan it will\" the timing wasn't great first off this virus had shut everything but Not least the weather probibly wasn't helping (All 4 seasons hourly) ....But we remained",
          "Driving up the East coast past the Old Man of Storr the Kilt Rock is well sign posted and the information boards are helpful There are great sea views from the viewpoint and a very impressive waterfall.",
          "Beautiful scenic views and a very impressive waterfall right on the main road so make this a pitstop on your travels around the island",
          "Nice stop along the east side of the Isle of Skye The pull off from the highway (A855) is quite close and then it is a fairly short walk to the viewpoint of Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls. The falls fall off of the cliffside down to the North Sea.",
          "A good stop for picture on the way to Quraing from Portree in Isle of Skye, view is good but not too special.",
          "Kilt Rock is amazing to see the stream pour over the very tall cliff into the ocean below. The wind was so strong and misty on an October evening that it chilled to the bone but was still worth the drive and the cold to experience it in person. A must see. The sheep grazing on",
          "Carpark was almost full when we arrived at Kilt Rock. Winds were really strong, with breath-taking views infront of you. Would have loved to stay on a little longer, but the tour coaches started pulling in and we left due to the in-coming crowd.",
          "We visited in the morning before the tour buses arrive (tour buses still at Old Man Storr). Plenty of parking and free entry, it was a particularly breezy fall day. Kilt rock was another amazing stop on Skye. Drone pilots rejoice as there were no drone prohibition signs during",
          "Nice drive along the coast, lovely views of the coastline. Very photogenic and worth the walk. Close to Storr.",
          "Definitely worth a look, and the Old Man of Story is just up the road. Free parking is available. Worth having your camera.",
          "It was unbelievably windy the day we visited and it was all I could do to face into the wind and try to get a picture of the falls. But the sound of the thundering waves and the falls is forever etched into the day!!",
          "It's a lovely view of the cliffs along the coast and to look out over the ocean, but it can be crowded and waiting for that perfect picture can take some time.",
          "Fabulous views and a stunning walerfall. Don't miss this on your travels around Skye. Quite a few tourists around but not too busy.",
          "What a great little stop! The cliff reminded me a bit of the Irish Cliffs of Moher. However, here, there is a great waterfall and the rock formation truly reminds you of kilts. A helpful sign explains the geology.",
          "Amazing viewpoint, and easy to get to. Not a long or hard walk at all to get to the viewpoint. I would think that even a wheelchair bound person could access the viewpoint with some help, which is a rare thing in Scotland. Well worth seeing!",
          "This is another good stop on the peninsula drive. Very picturesque, be sure to look for the waterfalls.",
          "We were fortunate to be traveling near here early in the day. It was a lovely spot to stop and stretch our legs before continuing on our journey. The are lots of othe spectacular views on this island, but if you are nearby do stop for a bit.",
          "Lovely view however spent all of 2 minutes there due to people barging and pushing eachother desperate for a photo and a selfie. We are all there for the same reason, fighting for a space...cmon guys.",
          "Went to Kilt Rock and the falls whilst visiting the Island and glad I did. Its got to be one of the highlights. The car park is small but it empties quick enough just be aware when its wet if you pick the wrong spot you can get stuck but saying that people around did help when",
          "Beautiful waterfall in such a dramatic place that will leave you in awe! Weather is not important. The power if the water is incredible.",
          "Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls has a lovely view and is a nice quick stop. Parking wasn't a problem for us since there were lots of cars coming and going.",
          "Nice place to have a quick stop and get a good view of the steep Kilt rock and Mealt falls. However pretty windy.. so go prepared..",
          "Another wonderful place to view the vastness of the sea. Little crowded with other tourists, but we loved it.",
          "The scenery everywhere on thd Isle of Skye is fantastic. I rated this as 2, as it was crowded with tour groups and there are plenty of nicer spots. The trick is to find the many places that the tour buses cannot navigate (alot of 1 lane roads throughout the Isle of Skye).",
          "Car park small, however free and good size viewing area. Worth a visit. Also if you have binoculars then you may be able to see whales!",
          "It was a pretty view and a nice quick stop to see the falls. You can't see the whole falls from the viewpoint but still pretty",
          "Definitely too many cars and tour buses and the road surface had large ruts that were also causing problems. But if you can find a spot, the walk is short to get to the views of beautiful cliffs and the impressive Mealt waterfall. A resident food truck and bagpiper make it",
          "Both Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls (a Beautiful waterfall running down the side of the island) can be seen from the same viewpoint and it is well worth a view! Car park quite big and was quiet when we were there but I imagine can get quite busy in peak seasons!",
          "While driving around the Trotternish Loop we stopped at Kilt Rock to admire the stunning views and amazing waterfall. The famous Kilt Rock is a sea cliff in north east Trotternish. It is said to resemble a kilt, with vertical basalt columns to form the pleats and intruded",
          "Classic views of the cliffs and waterfall, you park very close the viewpoint so the stop doesn't take long. The parking lot is closed for major repairs so you must park along the road without much room but everyone is doing it.",
          "We came in peak season in August which probably wasn't the best. The car park was overrun with cars parking anywhere they could leaving a one lane road with very busy 2 way traffic. The road isnt very well maintained in the carpark and has large potholes that were scraping the",
          "The steep cliffs are interesting with a history that goes back millions of years, and you clearly see the different layers, but you need some imagination to see the clan pattern",
          "We had the advantage of a lovely tour guide who told us the story of kilt rock with gusto! We loved seeing the waterfall and the views of the sea were amazing. This is a quick stop on your way to somewhere else and totally worth a look!",
          "This may seem a simple attraction of a waterfall going into the ocean. But looking closer you see a wild gush of strength in a waterfall forcing its way through rocks to the ocean a long way beneath. It is a majestic landform that makes a very good picture. It's free to see!",
          "It was windy and you can look out into the sea. As you are standing on the same cliff that the waterfall flows from, it is unlikely for you to get a front view of the falls, more of a side view. It is still a nice spot. Tour buses came here and that is when everyone starts to",
          "If you can park this is worth a stop. The day we were there the wind was over 50 mph. It was fun to try and stand and take a picture of the falls. The falls themselves are impressive as is the view of the water.",
          "Stopped here as part of a tour group to take some photos. Wow! What a fantastic spot. We were able to get some get shots which will definitely make it to the walls of our home!",
          "This place was stunning and the sound of the waterfall was so therapeutic. But beware the car park turns into chaos the minute coaches pull in and then spill out the passengers! It's not the best car park, with big craters in the road which makes it even more awkward. But that",
          "You can see from the side of these falls where they start and they do resemble a kilt. Beautiful beach and wonderful Bagpipe player for the crowd's enjoyment. Scotland is magical!",
          "There where a lot of people there, had to wait to see the waterfall. Nice place to see and continue driving.",
          "When returning to Isle of Skye I hope to see Kilt Rock from the water so you can get a good view of the waterfall flowing over the amazing hexagonal rocks like the ones at Giant\u2019s Causeway. The shoreline is beautiful, especially with a bagpipe playing in the background.",
          "Beautiful view in rainy or sunny weather. Stopped in today for the view and was surprised at the deep potholes on the way in to the car park. I know its bearing the 3nd of the tourist season, but hope upkeep is on the horizon for this road.",
          "The foggy weather cleared just in time to see the views, rocks and waterfall. It\u2019s worth the stop for a few minutes. It was way less crowded than Lealt Falls. It has a van to buy drinks or some food, however the car park has lots of potholes so be careful.",
          "The road in isnt the greatest and their isnt much parking. But once you get parked a small walk to the fenced off cliff edge, quick look to the left and wow. You are staring at a massive waterfall dropping into the sea. It is a great little trip and their is a snack van if you",
          "The area has had a lot of rain so the waterfall was amazing as it fell from 90 meter sea cliffs. The view-spot is a small parking lot (might be tough to get a parking spot though) close to the cliffs so access is very easy. Well worth the stop.",
          "This is a spectacular view of the cliffs, waterfall and the breathtaking vista of the sea. We were there on a bright sunny day with little wind and no rain. One of the most photogenic stops on our tour. A must see if you are in the area.",
          "Visited this awesome site during a recent visit to the Isle of Skye. The wind felt gale force and I struggled to remain upright. I saw at least two others get blown off their feet- obviously a concern when there are no safety guardrails and a tumble ove the cliff could be",
          "A must see when visiting Isle of Skye! An awesome waterfall descending from steep cliff into the ocean. Beautiful scenery, great for pictures",
          "Not nearly enough parking spots and roads in and out were poorly kept and overcrowded. That being said, it did have some beautiful views and a bagpiper guy playing his songs which was nice hear.",
          "Stunning views of the waterfall, best seen from sea level to really enjoy its magnificence and to see it from an angle free of the throngs of visitors that look at it from the viewing point",
          "The landscapes of Isle of Skye is incredible. A lot of miles you don\u2019t meet nobody, only sheeps and heather fields. Very clean air, mountains, waterfalls. Beautiful place for hiking, biking and enjoy of calm.",
          "I would go as it\u2019s only off the main road but it\u2019s nothing to get over excited about . It is beautiful and the scenery . Nothing much to say go and tick it off !",
          "We drove around to the recommended places and this was one day of them. It was a Rainey day but we still got out of the car to see this beautiful rock and waterfall.",
          "Nice view, would not do drive just to see it. Rushing waterfall due to heavy rains made it nicer. Heather in bloom.",
          "It\u2019s a cute little fall on the Jurassic coast of the Isle of Skye. If you pass by, it is worth the stop, but I wouldn\u2019t plan my trip around it... then again, you can plan a stop to eat at Ellishader cafe and art gallery followed by a visit at the fall, this would be a great",
          "The kilt rock and water fall are an amazing natural beauty. We have a canvas photo of the kilt rock in our home and we wanted to experience it for ourselves. After having seen it myself the photo doesn\u2019t do it justice.",
          "Be sure and stop here and bring your camera! Well worth the stop -breathtaking view! There are parking spots, but can get busy.",
          "Very busy parking and when busy it's difficult to get a view. So go early or late to avoid the hassle of queuing to park or view.",
          "The place is beautiful with amazing views amazing waterfall from the cliff nice picture to take there But there is very small parking lot there",
          "Try to get here early if you can to avoid the crowds. It\u2019s a must see while visiting Skye as the views of the cliffs are stunning. The bagpiper really made my day.",
          "Went today from Broadford to see this...tbh very underwhelming for what is there. There are much cooler areas to randomly stop by the side of the road to see! Parking was small and busy though understandable for a tourist spot and at least free. No walk required to see this from",
          "Breathtaking views of Kilt Rock, the waterfalls, and the ocean together with a lone bagpiper make this a must see stop at the Isle of Skye. I recommend trying the black pudding roll at the food truck. Delish! Make sure to come to the viewpoint early before the tour buses because",
          "Yep, the rock formation looks like a kilt. Wonderful short walk to viewing area. Parking is actually pretty good here.",
          "Beautiful spot for some cool photos. The view of the coastline is breathtaking. Images speak more than words.",
          "Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls were spectacular! Great viewpoint of it all, but with very limited parking being an issue. Was really nice to have a bagpipe player there to make us all feel more authentic to the Country!",
          "It's easy to stop off at Kilt Rock from the main road around this part of Skye. The resemblance to a kilt is not that pronounced - sets of perpendicular strata do form a sort of checked pattern but the main attraction is the sheer vertiginous drama of the soaring cliff faces to",
          "We were on a tour with Skye Mini Bus tours. it was a lovely sunny Sunday but the access and parking was horrendous due to very inconsiderate drivers who just abandoned their cars resulting in delays in getting out of the car park. Access to the viewing point is easy and not",
          "No hiking required for this one and WOW, it's gorgeous! Make sure you stop here to see that waterfall in person.",
          "You have a very nice view to the waterfall, sea and cliffs. It is worth to wait if the car park is full, can be quite overcrowded.",
          "This is a cool waterfall. It's hard to get a good angle of it since the nearby ledge or walkway doesn't extend out, but regardless the cliff view is amazing. Parking is dicey and filled with potholes. There is usually a food truck vendor and maybe a bagpiper. If you are doing",
          "Nice to see if you are passing but I wouldn\u2019t make a trip just to see it. Kilt rock is impressive but just a viewing point and no where to walk",
          "Even though it was raining sideways the day we went this was worth it. The view is outstanding and its easy to get to so people who can't hike can easily see this. A must stop on your tour.",
          "Beautiful views, stop and check out this site. The Kilt Rock is awesome sight when the rains come. The flow bursts out of the side of the cliff with such force! The kid in us inspired us to position this water arc coming out of our mouths or nose or other places for a comic",
          "Not overly impressed with this rock formation. Seen similar in Iceland and New England, U.S. Parking was an issue and not managed by anyone. Would not waste time if you are on a tight schedule.",
          "Not the most spectacular attraction to see on skye but worth going to visit for the views. There was also a piper there too.",
          "A very exceptional waterfall as it descends over the cliff into the sea. It must be a prettier view from out in the sea looking back.. Parking was free and it is a short easy walk to the side of the cliff. A must see on the island.",
          "A quick stop off the road, this is worth a visit. Unfortunately, the view of the falls is minimal simply due to the geography of the cliffs. Nevertheless, it's worth a stop. There was a bagpiper there when we visited, which enhanced the experience. There was also a food truck",
          "There are places where reality is free, where it is openly shown what is, what does exist. There nothing is hidden, nothing is hidden and silence is the owner. What a huge blessing is that there are places that nurture so deeply.",
          "Glad we stopped here to look at the view but it was very crowded. The view is very good but the parking could be improved.",
          "Crystal clear waters and rocks that look like a kilt, we had to see it and it did not disappoint. Scotland is so majestic.",
          "Was expecting so much more from our pit stop here but was left underwhelmed. Could barely see the waterfall due to bus loads of Chinese tourists taking over the place. We got a nice vegetarian haggis from the snack bar so our visit her wasn\u2019t a total bust. Sadly just like a lot",
          "We did not stay very long because it was raining, but we got a fun added bonus of the wind creating some interesting music when it hit the rocks.",
          "Fabulous views of rocks and waterfall. Good information board. Semi organized parking but again Highland council needs to take more action. Had amazingly good lentil soup and black pudding roll at Black Sheep van there. Don\u2019t usually eat at car park vans but glad I did here.",
          "Beautiful scenery living up to its reputation. Just had to be careful when taking photos. There's a fence area that gets pretty crowded with people taking photos. There are other areas close by but very dangerous and a slight wind can make you lose your balance.",
          "Other beautiful view! It is amazing, fantastic.. the wind is very power - take care! You will see A VIEW!!",
          "Ok, first off, if its dry and sunny, I guess it's a nice attraction, When we visited it was pouring, the river was in spate and the wind was so strong it was hard to stand up. I can honestly say that that is probably the best way to see them! Yes we got soaked but just wow! It",
          "This picture accompanying the review was not my experience. I didn't see the waterfall spewing from the rock but maybe that was because it was very foggy. There are some dinosaur tracks around and it's free to park.",
          "Honestly, there is nothing special about this particular waterfall. The place is clowded with tourists and it's quite difficult to park.",
          "After you park and walk up the walkway you will see a plaque with some dinosaur footprints. But the main reason for the stop is the beautiful coastline view and rock formation. Kilt rock is worth stopping to see and take some pictures.",
          "Been there a few times before but been shocked about the state of the place/parking place. It's not the people who don't care where they park and where they go. One way? why pay attention to it? Stay at the tarmac? why? it's absolutely shocking to see this and why people are",
          "Nice stop as it's just off the main road. Small car park .The Isle of Skye is a wonderful place and has lots of photo opportunities. Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls are difficult to see well from the cliff edge, but still worth a quick visit. Fantastic viewpoint.The viewing platform",
          "As advised by others, this can be a quick stop for scenery and some photo taking. Won't take longer than 30 minutes. You can also get some hot drinks here.",
          "The coastline at Kilt Rock is beautiful and if you struggle with mobility or walking long distances then this is a great view point. The falls themselves weren\u2019t overly impressive, maybe because it had be fairly dry in the days before our visit. There was a piper there when we",
          "A car park with great views without needing to go for a walk. Worth a stop as you are passing doing the trotternish loop.",
          "It\u2019s along the way to other locations. It\u2019s by the sea so one of the quick stops that you can make.. probably enjoy it for 5-15mins before moving on. Still a nice landmark to tick off the list, out of many sights in isle of skye :)",
          "Simply awesome view and the waterfall adds another dimension to this place. Definitely one of the most beautiful places on Isle of Skye. Too good and must visit.be ready for windy and rains though but that is another experience",
          "We were unaware of this place but glad our tour bus stopped here. Some of the other passengers did not leave the bus but we did! despite the strong wind , we enjoyed great views. We only stopped here for 10 minutes so I am not sure if there is a walk to see a better view of the",
          "This was a great viewpoint over the ocean and there are some good views of the cliffs. It was crowded when we went, so we waited for people to leave so we could get some decent pictures. The falls weren't too impressive, the water flow was somewhat low.",
          "We stopped here while driving around the Isle of Skye. Gorgeous view of the cliffs. Well worth the stop for photos!",
          "When we arrived water fell on us like a light rain shower but there were no clouds. It was a weird experience. Then we realised that the wind was so strong it blew the waterfall water back up and inland. Beautiful spot!",
          "It was quite a long difficult single lane drive from uig so was expecting more. However, the filing rock formation was super neat and waterfall to the ocean was interesting. Maybe visit if you are in the vicinity.",
          "If you are in the area stop and admire the view but we drove over an hour to get there which we regretted.",
          "Amazing views, parking just a few steps away so no hiking needed. Kilt Rock had a food truck with snacks, desserts and hot drinks....truly wonderful and rare to find at an outdoor site. All that was missing was a portable restroom (since there isn't one anywhere nearby). We",
          "Although only a little water flowing over the cliffs the views were beautiful. Would suggest you visit as it is close to the road and if water flowing would be stunning",
          "Every time We visit here it never changes, the waterfall is always flowing, the wind is playing chimes on the metal fence and the view is brilliant. Car park is large enough even for the tour minibuses that frequent all the best points of Skye. The walk to the viewpoint was",
          "You have to drive around the Isle of Skye, this was one of many viewpoints to enjoy. It was a tad rainy the day we did this, but at least it was not crowded. Plan a day to drive up the coast each way. It was well worth it.",
          "We made a short stop here on our way to Dunvegan Castle. Spectacular views. I have a short video of the fall.",
          "Our visit to Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls happened to be on a lovely and sunny, albeit blustery Saturday in May and an excellent start to our trip to the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. Easy to find with sufficient parking for the day we were there including coach parking although",
          "Stunning views over the sea and cliffs, bit crowded but definetly a must do as it only takes 15 minutes to visit.",
          "To me, Kilt Rock seemed like a must-see tourist attraction. From there you have a nice view over the sea and the cliffs and if you're very lucky you might even be able to see dolphins.",
          "Won\u2019t take you more than 15 mins to see the place and to try to make a decent photo. Tour buses stop here, so it can get crowded.",
          "Well it's a fun stop along the road. It's a tad hard to get full view. The coast line is beautiful. It would not be something to drive out for on it's own, but driving around Isle of Skye it was a nice stop.",
          "This was very easy to get to, especially with the close proximity of the car park. We had excellent weather and enjoyed the views. Def recommend!",
          "Stunning view, visited in April, weather did not play nice but was good while we were at the falls. Highly recommend a visit if you are on the Isle of Skye. Can get very busy.",
          "Requires no effort to get to in terms of walking, which feels somewhat unusual, to be rewarded with a wonderful view so readily. In a way, that bit is a shame, seeing something so impressive from a car park. Anyway - regardless - it's well worth seeing.",
          "Not sure this a destination but it is just on the A855 just between all the other attractions like Old man of storr or the Quiraing so it is easy to stop by. Has a dedicated car park and it is well signed. The waterfall is beautiful!",
          "The viewing point at Kilt rock offers a panorama of the rocky coast of Skye with the bonus of the waters of a brook making a steep tumble straight into the sea. Although a nice place for a stop (picknick tables available on site) it should not be considered a destination by",
          "I have read many reviews but many people are saying that its disappointing but it has nothing to with the waterfall! It is all about the colour of the rocks, on a very clear day you will see that the rocks are marked naturally like a white tartan kilt. Many years ago sailors",
          "Easy to find and no walking involved. Small carpark (free) off the road up from the old man of Storr. The views all around were amazing, and the colours! You\u2019ll have to see for yourself. Some good interpretation boards on the formation of the Kilt rock.",
          "A lovely waterfall to see!! Lovely views of the sea and across the opposite side of Skye too.Good size car park as would be a popular visitor attraction.",
          "What a place. We visited on a very windy day and the waterfall was defying gravity. What an amazing place. Despite being really bad weather would really recommend it. Outstanding scenery, so if the weather is bad get out the car and go and see it, it is soo worth it. Scotland in",
          "The views here are breathtaking! There is a placard posted that gives history and educational information. Parking was good. Hiking could also be done from here.",
          "You can look in to infinity standing at this location. The waterfall is very closeby and the views are amazing.",
          "The views from here are simply amazing. Nowhere in the world, I saw a waterfall going straight to the see. Also, cliffs were something magical. It's worth a quick stop by. Also, the place has a car park, which was quite big.",
          "Great place to view the Jurassic coastline and the most unusual rock formations. No one should be tempted to climb over the barriers as there have been serious accidents and even fatalities resulting from unwise behaviour. If the mobile van is on site his bacon rolls are second",
          "This is one of the best view in Skye. The chilling wind of December made it more astounding. The Pacific looks amazing from the view point. Its a amazing creation of mother nature.",
          "super easy to access - you see it from the car park literally. Cliffs + waterfall +sea = best union for the amazing sunset",
          "We visited the Isle of Skye over the New Year and one of the view points we visited was Kilt Rock. This was a fairly short visit. Having parked up, it was a short walk to the viewing point - right on the edge of the cliffs (with hand rails) spectacular views over the sea and of",
          "The parking lot was crowded and there were a lot of tour groups when we went, but we still had an amazing view of the falls. Took lots of pictures and enjoyed the view despite that.",
          "Impressive view of the falls & kilt rock beyond it, which is an unusual rock formation formed when lava hit the sea. One of the more accessible natural attractions on Skye.",
          "Visited on a very wet and windy day, a nice waterfall over the cliff into the clear waters below, despite the weather there were plenty of visitors",
          "The natural beauty of Scotland and Isle of Skye do not disappoint in any weather. Kilt Rock is remarkable to see in rain or shine.",
          "We saw an otter in the sea around the falls, unexpected surprised! Hold onto your hat though! This was super windy",
          "Easy walking to viewpoint. Parking close to location, right beside the road. Views are amazing. Recommend",
          "Kilt Rock is a sea cliff in north east Trotternish, in between Portree and Staffin and is famous for the Mealt Waterfall which dramatically freefalls off the cliff for 60m into the Sound of Raasay below. There is a carpark next to the view point for easy access to see the",
          "A full tour of the peninsula includes a stop at Kilt Rock. Easy to get to and offers wonderful views of both the cliffs and the ocean vistas.",
          "We were here on a somewhat drizzly day in October - but it was worth it as rainbows were everywhere and when we finally got to Kilt Rock - the view was stunning. There was a bagpiper playing near the parking lot, which added to the atmosphere. We did not have a lot of time here,",
          "The Kilt Rock cliffs are the most unusual cliffs I have seen in my life. They are so even and straight as if someone would just chop square blocks of their edges with high-tech machinery. The cliff got its name from the dolerite horizontal layers forming together with the",
          "It was POURING and the wind was crazy when we stopped. You could almost lean into the wind and it would catch you! But the view was stunning even with all the clouds and rain and my son thought it was amazing and well worth the drive out. We didn't spend long as it doesn't",
          "The best part of this area is the lovely big granite cliffs dropping down to clear waters below, with the waterfall running through the middle of the cliffs. There are lovely views over to the islands. Not much else to see here but there is plenty of parking. Make sure to",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way on a poor weather day to visit this. It was kind of cool and interesting but there are better places to spend your time.",
          "We parked up overnight here in our campervan, which provided us with time to admire the beauty of the place without the hoarders of tourists who were there when we arrived. I would recommend that you visit before 8.00am or after 5.00pm when the coaches have stopped taking their",
          "Good quick Visit. Nice views of the coast. Plenty of parking. Dress appropriately b/c of wind and cold",
          "We stopped here on a drive around the Trotternish Peninsula. Despite it being a very windy and slightly wet day it was a very popular stop. I found it fascinating that I think the wind through the rails almost made a singing noise. The only down side was the car park had many",
          "My second visit to here. It's fantastic. Best visited outwith the tourist season as it's only a small car park. My advice would be to use the local Skye tours to minimise the traffic to this area so we can all continue to enjoy this area",
          "I would say it is a must visit place when you are in the area. The place has a great view and as a place to get photos. There was lots of tourists that came by coach while we were there it took some time to get our turn to get photos of the waterfall.",
          "The view of Mealt Falls is quite spectacular and worth a stop for sure. We were headed on our way north. The parking lot was small and could easily get full. Amazing cliffs as you view south towards Portree. I can imagine what it all must be like on a beautiful day! Kilt Rock",
          "Unfortunately not a good day for us. The weather was foul with gale force winds and horizontal rain. Almost got blown off the top so headed back to the car getting whipped by the rain as we did. Probably grand views from the top,on a dry sunny day. Plenty of parking and",
          "Kilt rock was incredibly dramatic. The views across the cliff face on both sides of the lookout were simply stunning. Apparently there is an opportunity to see orcas and dolphins, but they were elusive the day we visited.",
          "The view is spectacular. Worth a visit and don't forget to get your camera. It's quite windy with a benches to relax.",
          "A photo point, and a beautiful one. The metal fence 'sings' which is nothing magic, just the wind, but it adds an interesting touch. Sadly however, another part of Skye being ruined by tourists. You have to get there really early to have a hope of getting parked. So many",
          "We stopped to look at the waterfall quickly on our way by. Worth a quick stop to see but wouldn\u2019t plan lots of time here as view point is limited.",
          "Kilt rock provides a great view of the waterfall over the cliff face quite spectacular. I guess it is one of those places you just have to visit as seeing is believing. The sheer drop of the cliff face and the view along the coast is fantastic.",
          "Visited this location in 50 knot windstorm and still worth it. With that much wind, the safety railing actually was making a sound like wind chimes. There are some nice views of a few smaller waterfalls and the ocean. You can see this in 15 minutes or less if you are in a",
          "This hidden gem is also worth the stop. Try to go in the morning, when the sun can create a rainbow on the waterfalls. Parking is good, and be sure to tip the bag pipe player.",
          "Misty day when we visited but the view was amazing. The Mealt Falls are stunning and the Kilt Rocks very dramatic. The drive from Portree to here is lovely with lots of places to stop and admire the scenery. A must see when visiting Skye",
          "If you are driving through Skye it is worth pulling over to check out Kilt Rock as it is not out of the way and the views are gorgeous! There were a few tourists at this stop at the same time as us, and we didn't have weather as clear as the stunning photo above, but we are glad",
          "Definitely worth a visit to view this spectacular spouting waterfall and the massive striated cliff rock behind it.",
          "Stopped here during our Isle Sky trip. Located very close by Brother's point. You are able to see interesting nature phenomen - waterfall which falling to the sea from high rock. Near rock is smaller parking. There from position with beauty views to cliffs.",
          "Breathtaking. There are 2 falls. One here and if you drive a little further you will find another. Well worth seeing. A must in my book",
          "The view from the edge of the cliff is beautiful. Seeing the water fall, however, is a bit trickier. It is still worth the stop if you are in the area to check it out.",
          "Kilt Rock and Steall Falls is a beautifully scenic area. Unfortunately you only get to see the edge of the falls from the viewpoint, but the surrounding area is still quite pretty. Someone in the group brought their drone and it was one of the better places to bring it. The area",
          "Stopped here on my way back from a walking circuit of the beautiful Rubha Hunish at Skye's northern tip. At around 3pm on a sunny September Saturday, it was a very busy spot and lots of motorists driving round in the hope that some of the parked vehicles would shift. As other",
          "A quick stop for the most beautiful view! Standing on the edge of the Falls (though fenced), it is absolutely mesmerizing! Definitely worth a stop when in Skye!",
          "From Quirang, we stopped here for a photo stop. A lot of tour buses stop here. From the car park, you walk a couple of minutes and you can see the waterfall - very impressive. The area is small and not a lot to see other than the Waterfall. We spent 15 minutes here. It",
          "Parked in a small car park which was in walking distance of the rock.It obviously has fencing all around.The rock formations do actually look like a kilt,and the waterfall was amazing well worth a visit",
          "This is a picture stop. The view of the falls and the cliffs is fantastic. The day we were there is was very windy. Worth to take 15 minutes time.",
          "Our visit to Kilt Rock left us breathless. Not because of the short walk from the parking area, but because of the beauty of it all. Pictures do not do it justice. It is a must see if you're able.",
          "Worthy of a visit, we only stay for about 20 minuets to take a few pictures. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Skye",
          "Stoped to view waterfalls and amazing view ,glad to see that parts have been fenced off to stop public spoiling the area and built viewing platform",
          "Stopped here while on our tour.The view is wonderful over the cliffs,and of the waterfall.very crowded with cars and tour busses,so you may need to wait to get that perfect photo.It was rainy and windy while we were there,however we still got some nice photos.woth a stop,for",
          "We went at sunset and it was amazing! You can see some great views so hang out for a while! You can\u2019t get super close to the falls but you can get good pictures!",
          "Like other tourist spots on Skye, Kilt Rock is not easy to get to and parking is very difficult. The infrastructure on Skye simply cannot keep up with the tourist demands. But once there, it is absolutely beautiful. One of the prettiest spots in all of Scotland.",
          "This can be a quick stop, the toughest part is to find parking. It is free however. Once you are in, walk to the viewing area and take your turn looking at the waterfall and view. It had rained a lot prior to our arrival so path was very wet and parking lot muddy. The view and",
          "Wonderful place to visit. Up until last weekend, I had never heard of Kilt Rock or the Mealt Falls. Very popular with tourists. Was lucky enough to have good weather at the time of visiting.",
          "This is a very neat rocky cliff-side that is easy to get to. Not too much else except for a great ocean view.",
          "This is a good place to stop and look at the special rock formation, and the waterfall. There is a overlook location to take pictures from, but you can not walk to the location. There are some food stands for a snack, but no restrooms. No entry fee.",
          "We drove the Trotternish Peninsula and this was one of the highlight stops. When we arrived there was a bagpiper in full regalia playing tunes.",
          "Absolutely stunning view of the Scottish coast from the overlook area with Mealt Falls pouring over the side. The drive from Portree north is windy and slow. If we'd had more time, we would have stopped to hike the Old Man of Storr trail on the way. Eat lunch in Portree",
          "Serene vista is often marred by loads of tourists esp in large buses. The parking is limited and once you have taken pictures there is not much to do so average stay is between 10-15 minutes",
          "Spectacular falls from the nearby Loch down 30m into the crystal clear ocean waters. Can get very busy as one of the first stops out of Portree.",
          "fantastic view from up there. the waterfall was really cool...great place to stop and take it all in...gets quite busy here with visitors",
          "You should absolutely stop here. It's a beautiful view when you're driving around the island. Great photo spot too :)",
          "The waterfall that plunges into the sea is beautiful! The coast here is stunning! And the dinosaurie steps are interesting! Did not know there had been dinosaurs in Scottland!",
          "Kilt Rock and its area are a very nice cliff formation above the sea. The day we were there no water was visible cascading over the cliff. There was a decent parking lot, and you could easily walk for a view of the cliffs. There were a couple of tour buses there while we were",
          "Beautiful views and truly shows off Skye\u2019s beauty. The bars have holes in them and when the wknd blows they create a beautiful tune. It will be very windy in the cliffs edge but the views make it worth while.",
          "Great views from viewing area very busy parking a nightmare but your only there for about 5-10 mins. Not much water down the waterfall",
          "Kilt rock and Mealt waterfall are a very quick detour off the main road so why not stop for 5-10 minutes?",
          "Yes, it is a high long waterfall, however nothing special about it otherwise. Nothing else to see. The cliffs are stunning, but you can see them around the island much better than at Kilt Rock.",
          "Must see in isle of Skye but... We were there at the end of the dry week and at the begging found it difficult to even spot the waterfall, so small it was. The viewing platform is quite long, waterfall is at the left. But again saying that, there are beautiful cliffs and green",
          "Lovely Coastline views. The rock formation contrasted with the green rolling hills and sparkling blue water makes for beautiful views. It can be a challenge to park and maneuver but there is plenty of room to get nice pictures without other people in them.",
          "The rock is impressive. The waterfall was not huge as it had been very hot. All in all rather disappointed. Worth seeing the rock but there are many beautiful waterfalls in Scotland that are much more impressive.",
          "Pretty bit of coastline with a free car park you can pull into. You may struggle to find a parking space depending on time of day. You can stop for a few mins, take some photos, utilise the food van if it's there, but I wouldn't say there was tonnes more than that to this place",
          "Views are great but tourists a plenty. Parking is very busy at this time of year and if you want a good photo from the view point you will need to wait. Remember the tourists are from all over the world so may not be as courteous as you would expect. Patience will be needed.",
          "For us this turned out to be a fifteen minute car stop after hiking up to the Old Man of Storr and before driving to Quiraing. As others have mentioned, the decently sized car park still gets pretty crowded as it\u2019s a popular place with tourist groups. There\u2019s more to see than",
          "So this was an easy walk of about 20metres... but the parking lot and the little access road to it was crowded and packed with cars... tip: don\u2019t park at the beginning of that road... there\u2019s enough space to park on the lot or along the road!! Dare to drive a little! The",
          "We came here on the day we were leaving Isle of Skye. It was definitely a pretty view from the overlook, but sadly the waterfall was very small the day we went. Even so, the view back south (opposite the waterfall) was magnificent and worth the trip alone. Im afraid of",
          "This is a viewing only area that offers very nice views of the coastline and Kilt Rock. While beautiful, it does not compare to really amazing coastline like Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, but it is worth the trek when you are on Skye to take in the sights.",
          "Beware. This place would be great if it looked like the photos on the web but I feel they have been photoshopped a lot. I drove for hours to take some photos and it wasn't even flowing even though the loch was full and heavy rain the night before. Not saying it never does but",
          "I am beyond terrified of highs, so I did not look down but out. All I can say is this place is amazing. Please go!",
          "The waterfall over Kilt Rock wasn\u2019t flowing much today. Not as impressive a waterfall at this time but nevertheless less still beautiful countryside. A very rough potholed track to the carpark.",
          "Really enjoyed the view but very busy. Lovely rock formations and great photos. Won't take long but enjoyable.",
          "The location is very pretty but it is difficult to get a good view of the falls. The water level may have been low when we were there.",
          "Did the drive around the coast near Uig. This was a lovely quick stop with beautiful views. Was glad for a sunny day, so I could see the scenery.",
          "You have to really bend yourself to get a good look and pictures but the waterfall is well worth it. One of the best areas to see in Scotland! Don't miss this!",
          "There is no denying this is a nice spot for views,but Skye has many stunning views in much more peaceful settings. On our arrival 2 coaches were just off loading their passengers & the car parking was somewhat of a challenge. The viewing area was taken over by people jostling",
          "We have recently visited this place. We are going to look at some nice pictures to have seen on intenet. Unfortunately, we did not have time to walk there. Nice view of Kilt Rock. We even saw a dolphin swimming by.",
          "Unfortunately the weather wasn't great when we stopped and with the lack of rain over the last few weeks the waterfall wasn't at its best. But it's still worth stopping at and seeing the dramatic coastline. Make sure you take your camera. Parking is very good and only a few",
          "Lovely views. Can just about see the waterfall. Scotsman playing the bagpipes was a nice atmosphere.",
          "Everyone stops here as it takes little effort and the view is good. The only reason I write the review is the Black Sheep food van. My 11 year old son Loved the bacon bin and we had cafe mochas. We weren't expecting much but it was The Best Mocha I've ever had anywhere. I see",
          "Quick stop off here after walking The Old Man of Storr and heading to Museum of Island Life. Bought lunch @The Black Sheep burger van. Amazing! The girl who served us was lovely & the food was amazing. We all agreed they were best beef burgers & veggie haggis burgers we had ever",
          "Stopped at Kilt Rock on the way to Old Man of Storr after having hiked the Quiraing. Was not really impressed (perhaps the summer season had dried up the waterfall considerably). In any case, worth a stop for some photos. No long hike needed as the view point is near the car",
          "Place is very nice but its very windy, so be careful with your mobile phones. Its nice but as per me its not in a must visit places.",
          "What a photogenic natural wonder. It was nothing short of a beautiful site. The signs for this site were clearly marked and easy to get to. If you are traveling in the summer, be prepared for crowds but worth the view.",
          "Although this is a popular stopping place on Skye, it is worth the stop. The waterfall is beautiful and the views are stunning. The parking lot can be a little crazy.",
          "This very tall cliff is called Kilt Rock because the stone formations look like that of a kilt. The very tall waterfall is a splendid sight as it crashes into the sea. Great views of the cliffs and expanse of the ocean. Good place to take a family Christmas Card Photo.",
          "Skye is too busy! And even relatively small attractions such as Kilt Rock attract coach loads of people. We ended up stopping for just 5 minutes because it was over-run.",
          "A very touristy port of call in Skye, including a guy in a kilt playing the bagpipes. I feel the signs were intentionally vague about the veracity and visibility of the dinosaur footprints because there may not be many spectacular ones there. It was also one of the most",
          "Drove through in a day and it was just amazing. Beautiful turn after beautiful turn on every road. Vermont and big sur on steroids. Drive carefully, take your time, and take pictures.",
          "The Kilt Rock itself is just a fine scenic bit of cliff, it's the waterfall in the foreground which sets it all off plus the blue, blue ocean.Decent parking and well worth a stop.",
          "Beautiful view..great photo opportunities..\ud83d\ude0a..best part of isle of skye is the whole stretch is so beautiful..and the points that have the best view have been marked perfecrly..kilt rock is another such point..worth it",
          "Kilt Rock itself is an interesting formation worthy of photos. I found the views out over the water from here to be more interesting than the rocks.",
          "Stunning views and the sound of the waterfall, with a bit of bagpipes in the background, was amazing. A bit busy with tourist buses but still didn't detract from the view.",
          "If you can get past the American and Chinese visitors to take a picture it is something different. Not much parking and more a quick stop than a planned picnic break. Enjoyed the view and took a few pix before our next location.",
          "The place is fantastic on its own regardless of any links to the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. Didn't really see any similarities myself. The rock face and waterfall are worth seeing.",
          "Well worth the stop- beautiful waterfall and fascinating rock formation. Room to park- at a popular viewing area.",
          "Mealt waterfall and Kilt Rock are 2 natural wonders of Skye well worth driving up to see them, decent views and some good birding as well",
          "We stopped in for a few minutes to see the rocks. Nice display. Family at home enjoyed seeing photos of it.",
          "Views easily accessible within steps from the parking lot. Not too far north past the Storr. Waterfall was weak in June but still a pretty cool site.",
          "This is an absolutely unique and stunning part of the Scottish coast line. There\u2019s a good truck and it\u2019s a good place to grab something to eat and just relax and take in the beauty. I couldn\u2019t stare at it long enough. Very beautiful.",
          "if you don't have a car is queite complicated to go ando come back, but don't hesitate the view is beautiful!",
          "Don't go out of your way to see Kilt Rock and Mealt Waterfall, but if you are on the road, you should stop and take a picture. It is a beautiful waterfall, and gorgeous view of the cliffs and ocean. Parking was good. Were a lot of people taking in the sights.",
          "We stopped in for a quick look see and loved the sights of the waterfall and cliffs. We also caughts a pod of dolphins playing off the coast that was fun to see for all of us",
          "Not really worth more than a few minutes stop to take pictures. I did notice the refreshment van was reasonably priced considering the captive market",
          "There is good access to this area and was enough parking although it was busy, It\u2019s easy to stop off for short while to enjoy the views.",
          "This point, with a car park, provides views over the impressive cliffs. In good weather, you'll also get excellent views across to nearby islands. One word of warning, it seems to be a regular stop for bus tours and the area can get very crowded.",
          "A beautiful waterfall and nice reefs along the shore is what you get to see just stopping by at the road. Considering all the effort you have to do to get to any other attraction in Skye, that\u2019s a bargain!",
          "We weren't sure if we would find our turn off but, THIS TIME, there WERE actual signs pointing toward the entrance (unlike most of the other island attractions)! It was quite busy and you have to grab your photo moments whenever you get the chance because everyone seems to want",
          "Nice place with a long waterfall. Amazing views of nature. We didn\u2019t stay long as we need to visit another place, ample parking. Do come here if you pass by.",
          "Kilt Rock was very neat to see and the waterfalls that you can also see from the view spot were nice. The stop is just that, a quick stop, but still nice to see and stretch the legs. There is a nice little parking area. No need to bring walking shoes as it isn't much more than",
          "As a guide pointed out, visitors often misunderstand that the reason for coming to the view point is not the nearby waterfall spouting from the cliff top but the amazing cliff / headland some half mile away where the rock strata have been forced up vertically. Due to their",
          "Very easy to get to just off the main road, this little park was awesome views of the nearby islands and the northern mountains of Scotland across the bay. The cliff views running along this park are fantastic as well, with the waterfall providing a lot of flow and beauty.",
          "Hear the fairys sing from this spot by the sea, and yes, you will hear them. A nice place to stop and see on your way to something else.",
          "Beautiful waterfall on the edge of a cliff on the Isle of Skye. There was also a gentleman playing bag pipes which was very enjoyable to listen to.",
          "A lifetime experience on a clear day. No words describe it. I have never seen such a beautiful place.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous! Something you would expect to see on a postcard. The isle of Skye has so many amazing places!",
          "It's one of the must see place if you are in the isle of Skye. The Newly falls is very beautiful. When we went there it was very cloudy. I'm sure it would be a stunning view on sunny days.",
          "What makes this cliff edge stand out is the waterfall. Otherwise there are rock formations of the same type at various sites across the island. Worth a short stop if passing but wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",
          "Looks heavenly !! On a bright sunny day the water looks beautiful . However no toilet facilities at or nearby. 2 mins walk from Car park till the view point",
          "I have seen a lot of amazing waterfalls, so maybe I am being to harsh, but it wasn't anything special. I found the view looking over the water gorgeous but the waterfall was anticlimactic.",
          "It was so foggy that the kilt rock was not visible, better to go on a sunny day. Be careful not to get too close to the edge. There is a small van serving snacks and coffee.",
          "Even though it was raining we enjoyed a quick visit here and the the view is great to see. The waterful is impressive to see coming over the side of the cliff.",
          "The falls are a wondrous sight, but unfortunately, the angle you view them from is quite awkward and is made more awkward by the crowds that are a constant feature on the Isle of Skye. Parking is a challenge, so be prepared to wait. Nevertheless, I recommend it not only for",
          "not what we expected at all...short walk to the view point.was not what the pictures we seen had showed in person",
          "This location offers lush greens, splendid views of the sea and a high altitude water fall directly dropping into the sea.",
          "Wonderful place for pictures. The rock formations and breathtaking waterfall are beautiful. The views over the water and distant mountains were also great.",
          "Extraordinary falls, large altitude and the water is falling directly to the sea. A really impressive picture.",
          "This spot is spectacular, waterfall and the steep cliffs makes for a fantastic view as the water plunges deep into the sea underneath. Dramatic and great view. Recommended to drop in between Staffin and Portree.",
          "Beautiful waterfall to stop and look at if you are driving by. Very lovely views of the coast, but very busy.",
          "Stopped at Kilt rock on our drive around Trotternish. Busy even though early on in the season, parking OK, but wonder what it would be like in the summer. Waterfall is amazing.",
          "We were driving buy and noticed the sign somwe stopped and had as look. Yes very impressive and the little water fall is scenic however can be very cold with the sea breeze.",
          "This place is a very nice place to stop and take a break. The view is lovely and you can read about the connection of this place to dinosaurs. Beautiful waterfall makes it a perfect spot for a lovely picture. I recommend :)",
          "We stopped off here and the waterfall was amazing great parking and very clean one of the many waterfalls we visited beautiful views and one of the most interesting roads to travel on.",
          "We stopped at this on our drive around the Trotternish Peninsula. For one stop you can see a spectacular waterfall which drops to the sea and further in the distance the Kilt Rock. Spectacular views.",
          "Good points - ample parking just off the main road - great views of the north and south coast Bad points - view point is not best angle for photographing the waterfall",
          "Just about another 10 minute drive from the Old Man of Storr, it is worth the stop to see these cliffs and incredible blue water. There is a car park there, and usually grazing sheep and goats in the surrounding area. It can be windy up there, so bring a jacket!",
          "Well worth a vist for the views alone. We were lucky enough to be there when the falls had frozen. Just breathtaking.",
          "Go here! If it's windy you can hear the fairy pipes playing! Also, You can take some funny pictures!",
          "This is one of the 'must see' attractions in Isle of Skye. It is best to go there early in the day when the number of tourists is very little. You need to be quiet and just breathe when you stand and watch the water dashing over the rock with views overlooking the wide vast",
          "It was humbling to stand before such a wondrous creation of nature. Absolutely stunning and enjoyed the information boards detailing the history of the place and dinosaurs. Parking is very close to the viewing point so would be suitable for those with mobility problems unlike a",
          "Worth a visit, any time of year. It's beautiful and you get the most fantastic view from the viewpoint. Ample parking.",
          "This is a fall right into the atlantic ocean. From a sightseeing platform you may tale some nice pictures, however this platform is usually really crowded and depending on the sunshine you will have always shodows from other visitors on the picture. So you may need some time",
          "a very beautiful place to visit. stunning views. it does really look like a kilt and Mealt falls is very impressive",
          "Kilt Rock is just one more place to stand in awe of the amazing beauty that is Scotland. Wow. No hiking is required--just bring your camera and sense of wonder. You'll want to absorb this view into your pores and hold it there forever--even though the rock doesn't really look",
          "Worth the stop. Not much of a parking lot. I would nt want to be driving a trailer. It's close to old man or Storr and the Quiraing Turn off. Recommended.",
          "One of the most memorable features of visiting Kilt Rock is the haunting sound of the winds hitting the metal railings. It sounds like a haunting scream or cry that can be heard from the parking lot. As your approach the barriers, you understand how the sound is made. It makes",
          "We were recommended to go there for the views and they certainly did not disappoint. The waterfall was spectacular as the lake behind emptied over the rocks into the sea. The views over the sea towards Wester Ross were amazing but not always available as they are weather",
          "30 seconds from main road with a spectacular view of waterfall over cliffs from nearby Lake into the sea",
          "Another victim of the worldwide obsession of naming rocks after objects/things which they only vaguely resemble. However it's impressive and easy to pull up in the car park just off the road and spend a few mins at the view point. Shame there isn't a boat trip so you can get a",
          "The rock formation here looks like the pleats on a kilt with a large waterfall flowing over the top. It is a long way down. Reminded us of the cliffs in Ireland.",
          "I think you have to use your imagination to see it it but there is a resemblance. I would not call this amazing place and would not make a special trip to see it but I am glad I was ablt to visit. It was cold the day I was there so be prepared for a cold wind.",
          "Super windy day but I am so glad we went. Views were amazing and since we weren\u2019t there during the busy season we got to enjoy the area.",
          "If it falls on your way, make a quick stop to take in the views and see the falls. Else, don't make a special effort to drive all the way. Almost everyone makes a quick top for a few minutes, get a couple of pictures and are on their way.",
          "We recently stopped by Kilt Rock for a look on our drive around the north of Skye. The scenery is beautiful, and there are plenty of information boards. Be sure to have a look at the view down along the south coast as well. It\u2019s a shame that there are so many bus tours stopping",
          "We stopped here during a drive around the north of the island - we actually knew nothing about it but stopped when we saw the sign. What a wonderful surprise! A huge waterfall shooting from the side of the cliff on one side, and stunning views up and down the coast on both",
          "Summer weekend visit - great views over the water and islands. Tip: it gets very crowded during the afternoon but a 20 minute visit will get you some great pictures and when I visited, there was a kilt clad Scotsman with his bagpipes who was friendly enough to let people take a",
          "If your touring Skye then you will pass this spot and it would be stupid to just pass it by. Free parking and a very short distance to the cliff edge which if it\u2019s windy you\u2019ll get to hear the musical barrier that stops you falling over the edge. Here you will see Kilt rock in",
          "We stayed only minutes away from this spectacular waterfall! Easy to find and park but then we were early. Absolutely breathtaking! If we had the time I would have gone back in the evening just to sit and enjoy the sunset. Imagine the beauty!",
          "The waterfall plunges over the edge of the cliff into the sea below making a rainbow over the water. It is almost always windy here and the wind blowing through the metal railings of the fence makes an interesting musical accompaniment to the viewing. The views are tremendous.",
          "Nice quick stop off circular coastal road near portree. Good parking and flat access to see the waterfall. Only a 5-10 stop but well worth seeing.",
          "Nice little tourist attraction on the road from Staffin to Portree. Good photo opportunity. Adequate car parking next to the viewpoint. Well worth 5 minutes of your time",
          "An outstanding waterfall dropping down into the sea, while we were there a Japanese tourist appeared with a drone and took some wonderful film and images. You can get quite good photos of the waterfall and coastal views from an ordinary hand held camera but the new drone",
          "The 55m tall dolerite rocks are said to resemble the pleats of a kilt. The Mealt waterfall also falls into the sea here, fed by Loch Mealt. There is a convenient car park on the road between Staffin and Portree, and no charge to view these natural wonders. Once you have seen",
          "When we visited, it was typical Scottish weather. Sunshine one moment, rain the next, and always windy. When prodded on the state of the weather, islanders simply answer \"The weather is the weather\". Walking up from the road, the wind and drizzle made it somewhat difficult to",
          "Well worth stopping for photos of the amazing scenery. Skye is totally one place I will travel to again....So many great adventures all in one place.",
          "We didn't get to enjoy this place as much as we had planned as the weather was ferocious the day we visited. Thankfully, even with the wind and rain, we were able to see the waterfall reach the bottom. Great stop if heading through the Quiriang.",
          "We drove in to here after wali g up Storr. It is an excellent view off the cliff edge but that\u2019s about it. Worth a see but combine it with something else to get the most out of the island which has loads to see.",
          "The waterfall is beautiful and the rock itself is interesting. The weather was not very nice when we were there, but it was worth a 10-minute stop",
          "Kilt Rock is a beautiful cliff + waterfall that will amaze everyone for its beauty. You do not have to do any hikes to see it, so it could be recommended to anyone who would like to see some of nature's wonders :) There is touristic information about the location and even a wee",
          "Drive past and tried to stop but the car park was packed with coaches of tourists - roadway in has deep ruts so it was tricky getting in and out. The quantity of tourists and Scottish piper really took the edge off a lovely scene. I wouldn't recommend visiting during the height",
          "This waterfall is spectacular. It's literally an immediate turn off of the road with a nice parking lot and fenced off area for taking in the scenery. If you are out for a drive around Isle of Skye this is a must stop.",
          "It's just a neat cliff. Our entire stop lasted under ten minutes. Don't drive here especially, but if you are passing give your legs a stretch and check out Kilt Rock.",
          "They were very nice cliffs, and the views were wonderful (we went on a fairly clear day) but they were fairly standard cliffs.",
          "Bre prepared the midges are out to get you here...but quite spectacular, but only takes a short visit to view",
          "This is a 90 meters high sea cliff in north east Trotternish. It is said to resemble a kilt, with vertical basalt columns and the name derives from this resemblence. There is also a powerfull waterfall on the left side of the cliff. The view is magnificient. It's a must stop.",
          "You may want to hire someone to take you on a tour of Skye. If you do, I recommend you include Kilt Rock as a place you want to visit. The view provides a great view of the rock, and the waterfall that dumps directly into the ocean. Rain or shine, it is a great place to visit.",
          "We pulled off to take a quick break and were wonderfully surprised by the beautiful waterfall and ocean views of kilt rock.",
          "Make sure you stop for twenty minutes at the free car park to see this fantastic waterfall plunging over the cliff and the lovely Kilt Rock cliffs in the distance. Great for atmospheric photographs and if you are luck the bagpipe player won't be playing (... only plays for coach",
          "Beautiful waterfalls to see on the Isle of Skye (only 12 minutes to the Old Man of Storr rock formation) so could be combined. Parking is free and the waterfalls are very close to the parking lot. It doesn't take long to see. We were there for about 20 minutes. Also, if you",
          "Each rock is unique. We obviously get that. Each rock is bound to bear some resemblance with some man-made construction. We also get that But to actually make a point around it is plain ridiculous! Rather spend time checking out the dinosaur footprints at the view point itself.",
          "I visited Kilt Rock twice in a 12 month period with some friends in summer 2016 and 2017 respectively. The first visit was at the end of a two week dry period which meant, whilst the background cliffs with the sill were impressive, the waterfall was barely a trickle. When I",
          "From the road there is nothing to see apart from a bit of heathland congested with cars - and if it is crowded you wonder whether its worth the queue to park. However, do stop, the waterfall cascading over the cliff is very impressive",
          "This is an unassuming spot, we drove by and came back! Nice rocky outcrops , waterfalls and cliff edge! There was a piper playing on the day we were there and it added to the ambience of the site!",
          "Kilt Rock is an amazing place, although when standing looking at the waterfall you kind of forget about it. The waterfall is so amazing! Just past this huge flowing outcropping of water is Kilt Rock, in the distance. So if you can take your eyes away from the waterfall to see",
          "This is a very nice scene that I take a lot of photos here. It is our last spot before we leave the Isle of Skye. The atmosphere is so clam, so natural and so peaceful. When you see the vast ocean and the waterfall, they are just living together in harmony! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Kilt Rock appears off the side of the road in an unassumming place. Stop and take some photos--just a quick stop along the way.",
          "This lookout offers stunning views of waterfalls, cliffs , and isles across the bay. Definitely worth a stop on a clear day...parking lot is tight. There was a piper while we visited and it added just that little bit extra.",
          "Get here early when it is high season for tourists or you'll be stuck trying to park amongst the tour buses and other visitors. Wonderful views that will take your breath away.",
          "Not only great views of this beautiful waterfall, but also acroos the bay. An additional pleasure was a bagpiper playing very well for the visitors and happy to pose for photos.",
          "This was an interesting waterfall, however, it was not any more dramatic than several other waterfalls we have seen on Skye.",
          "Kilt rock It's a small version of Cliffs of Moher Ireland it's the same style and the same view expect these are nothing compared to the huge ones of Moher,These have a wonderful view of the ocean and have a small waterfall going down to the ocean,There is also a small",
          "Dyring our tour we stopped here. The area is rather limited and I would have liked to see paths leading up to the rick. Of all the destinations of Isle of Skye, this is my least favourite.",
          "This is a great place to visit. Exceptional busy sometimes. I visited this place at 630 am. I was the only one there (except some campers staying overnight and still sleeping ;-)) This was a wonderful experience! Highly recommended. After visiting kilt rock, you can easily drive",
          "This is popular on trip advisor just because it is easy to and is well signposted off the main road. IT will take you 5 minutes, but perhaps longer to find a park!",
          "This pair of scenic splendors make for a great stop and snap: they are on the road between Old Man of Storr and the Quiraing, with a large parking lot to accommodate visitors. Both are also protected behind a series of fences so sight-lines are fairly restricted and though the",
          "Lovely coastal view and convenient lay-by. Recommended short stop when doing the northern Skye loop road. Car park can get busy try going in the evening.",
          "A popular stop along the Trotternish Peninsula at the Northern end of the Isle of Skye, this interesting rock formation is easily visible with a short walk from the road-side parking lot. Following the paths down a bit further will reward with a neat view up the river valley.",
          "Did a pit stop to see the place and was awed by the beautiful view of the sea across! Very calming and relaxing.",
          "Kilt Rock is visible from the Mealt Falls. This is a nice waterfall, ending in the sea. There are bences to relax. We had a bag piper play when we arrived. Kilt Rock is supposed to resemble a kilt, not that sure about it but a wondeful view nevertheless. Free parking.",
          "The view in the photo is easily walked to and I'd recommend climbing down to the beach level to get views of the waterfalls. You'll need good shoes to do this part though.",
          "A beautiful place to visit the scenery is outstanding. You need to be aware there there are no toilet facilities at the location. Also, you need a car to get to the location, unless you want to take a tour of Skye.",
          "You will have seen enough other waterfalls, but this one is special for me: it ends up in sea. This view is from a platform specially built for the tourists.",
          "If you are visiting the Isle of Skye and want to be certain to say that you've been there, this is the place to visit, it's a must see",
          "I think that tourist buses should not be allowed to park here. While we were parked a fist fight nearly broke out because a tour bus had blocked the exit and literally no traffic could move. So while we were \"stuck\" at this wonderful place I took plenty of photos of the",
          "The Mealt Falls and Kilt Rock were one of the first things I wanted to see on Skye, but being honest they were a little disappointing. The carpark was full to overflowing and very pot-holed and muddy, the viewing areas were also very muddy and you pretty much had to queue to get",
          "Saw this amazing scenery driving all around Skye on a beautiful sunny day. What a beautiful country, well worth the minor hassles from the narrow and often one-track roads and tight squeezes. In summer very tough to find space in the car parks and viewing areas as they're all",
          "Drove in for a quick look. Had lovely view of the ocean and falls. Not a huge carpark. There is a food truck there butvwasnt open when i was there.",
          "quick stop on the side of the road. very very crowded, i think because it is one of the few places on skye that you can easily walk right up to. the waterfall is close to the viewing point and can be difficult to get a glimpse of if there are a lot of people there when you visit.",
          "It's supposed to be a must-see, but we've seen plenty more beatiful cliffs in Scotland. The hoards of tourists don't help it's appeal either.",
          "The view was great and you didn't really need to walk far. The rocks did look like the folds of a kilt...hence the name. In order to get a good shot of the waterfall...hang on to your phone or camera and lean way over to get it!!!",
          "The parking lot was very busy, we had to wait in line to get a spot, but everyone was patient. It was pouring when we arrived, but had lightened up by the time we left. Quick little stop, just a few steps from the main road. No hiking or long trails to follow. There was a little",
          "Worth a trip to see this. Only a viewpoint no other facimities but stunning scenery all out round the water. Unusual rock formation just incredible to look at.",
          "Driving to the Kilt Rock viewing area was a challenge, with one way traffic during portions of the drive, but the view once you get there is stunning. One note, there are no toilet facilities either at the site or on the route there, so use a facility before you make the trek.",
          "Stopped here on the way back from a late hike at the Quiraing and around 7:45 the lot was nearly empty but plenty of light in the summertime. Also an eerie sound of the wind going through either the rocks or the fence post was hauntingly beautiful.",
          "Must do on your way to A855. Isle of Skye is magical and this place is one of those magical places. You can witness the waterfalls and the rock formations from a distance, but you can take a pit stop for 20 minutes and see it from up close. Parking is plenty and easy.",
          "on the edge od Skye you can see this waterfall and rockformation and look unto the sea. Or just sit quietly and hear the birds. Lots of them nesting on the rocks below",
          "This is a must see as it's a quick stop along A855! We spent a quick 10 minutes there. You'll be driving past this viewpoint anyways, most likely, so worth it to stop and see the beautiful cliffs and scenic waterfall. It's absolutely stunning! There's plenty of parking at this",
          "One of the many waterfalls on the island. At the time of our visit many tourists and full parking. Nice place, but we've visited better waterfalls, where we have to walk by green nature. Available for wheelchair users, bagpiper for money available :-)",
          "It's breathtaking. You'll look over the ledge to the waterfall and to kilt rock behind it (named because the ripples in the stone look like the pleats of a kilt). There were quite a few people in June, but not overwhelming so. There are other beautiful sites (including",
          "This is a must see just off the road between Portree and Staffin. It is just a place to stop off at and stretch your legs with no need to spend hours getting to or viewing. Very pleasant.",
          "We came upon the falls while travelling around the Isle of Skye. Best to time your arrival when the tour buses are not there. Parking can be an issue.",
          "We visited Kilt rock falls during 40 mph winds!! A hairy experience, but well worth seeing. Small parking area. Very busy with tourists and buses when we were there.",
          "I guess it could be busy here because its so beautiful, however there was almost no one here when we stopped. Drop dead views that shouldn't be missed on any tour of the island. It's dramatic. Do go, it doesn't take long to see it and it's free.",
          "Lovely waterfall and views...but the small biting bugs were too much to be able to enjoy it. There was a food truck (great idea!) And a handsome Scot playing the bagpipes in a kilt. That almost made up for the 13 bites all over my 6 yr old son's face! With bug spray I",
          "While this does not require more than a few minutes, the view is worth it. On the one side, a glorious waterfall with the impressive Kilt Rock in the distance. On the other, beautiful cliffs overlooking the deep blue sea. Take a moment to view the molds of the dinosaur",
          "The views of the cliff were absolutely stunning. Very easy to get to however there were lots of people. If you're doing a lot that day it's a great stop to get out of the car and stretch your legs.",
          "Great waterfall, easy to reach so don't miss on taking a brake and enjoy the scenery views it provides.",
          "This was a nice spot, but there are many other places along Skye with as nice or nicer of a view. It's neat that it's a rock with a waterfall, but if you miss this stop ,it won't be the end of the world. It was nice to have a bagpipe player on-site, however, the tour busses were",
          "This is beautiful, but too darn busy. If you spot any busses, get out. You can get stuck in the lot sometimes. Its right off the road, so easy to stop in, but many other great places on Skye, so don't take too much time.",
          "Another of Skye's lovely attractions offering easy access for the whole family. Great photo opportunities!",
          "Worth a stop as you tour around the island. The waterfall was rather sparse when we were there, but pretty nonetheless. I can see why it is supposed to be a \"plaid\" rock. Views in the opposite direction are also great. There is also a little dinosaur footprint exhibit there.",
          "If you are driving by, do stop! Waterfalls are always worth the gander! It's easy to access and is lovely!",
          "Very beautiful place with the wind blowing into your face. The guides tell you that it is like the Giants Causeway of Ireland, do not believe them. The Giants Causeway is way more windy, and beautiful.",
          "This cliff-top attraction, on the east side of the Isle of Skye, is a great addition to a daylong tour of the island. Reminiscent of the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, it is not as dramatic but is definitely worth a visit. Parking can be a bit dicey but with patience, a good spot",
          "Touring around Skye in car - amazing geographical feature. Despite rain and feeling unwell still managed to appreciate the awe of this place. You can see across the sea for miles. Really thought provoking place.",
          "Visited Kilt Rock this evening and the views were amazing. It was a beautiful evening though a little breezy which didn't put us off going up to the viewpoint to take some photos. Another hidden gem Skye has to offer.",
          "This was fine for a quick stop but don't go out of your way to see it. From the view point you can sort of see a waterfall on the side and kilt rock in the background but neither are great views. It's also very packed with tour buses rolling in constantly so you cant even get a",
          "Pull in for five minutes and snap a photo. Quite a long drop down to the water. Worth a quick visit.",
          "Kilt Rock was a cool spot to visit. It can get very busy, and the viewing point is not very big, so it can get crowded. Also, the parking is very small.",
          "Stopped here on our tour round Skye. Big parking area that is free of charge, with stand selling coffee ect. Lovely view. We sat and had our lunch here.",
          "This is a quick stop on the side of the road. Once you park the car it is less than 100 meters to the rock and waterfall. The day we visited there was a Scottish piper playing which added a really special touch to the whole experience. With the overall atmosphere created by the",
          "Spectacular view. Stop in the car park and walk out for the best view. It can be very very windy, so hang on!",
          "The view from the top is stunning to say the least, especially where the water falls over the cliff. Look for the cotton flowers in bloom here. They feel just like a tuff of cotton. When we were there, there was a bagpiper and this added to the whole ambiance.",
          "The kilt rock does look like the Scottish kilt pleats. The water fall is not huge but the experience of standing over the cliff is mesmerising. Yhe wind is really strong so need to be careful about the camera here. Must visit while on Skye.",
          "Quite a different scenario as the river breaks out over the cliff into the sea far below. Again, strong winds have to be taken into account, so wrap up well. Great little coffee shack right beside it.",
          "The scenery is so stellar in Skye that by the time you get to Kilt Rock it's easy to be almost numb to what you're seeing. Or maybe it's just the cold breeze and driving rain. Either way, Kilt Rock is worth a stop and walk to get a look.",
          "What can we say. We rent and drive as we travel and this was a stop for a view suggested by the travel book. Worth a look if you have a car and time.",
          "The view around is nice and worth seeing. I expected more from reading about this site so left a little disappointed.",
          "We stopped at kilt rock the see the waterfall and dinosaur footprints. In fortunately the site doesn't actually have authentic dinosaur fossils, unless we just missed them somehow. The view is fantastic though.",
          "This is just on the road and is worth walking out to the cliffs to see the colours of the ocean against the rocky cliff for,action. The waterfall going into the sea is unusual and makes for a a special sight, but it is the cliffs and the sea that grabbed my attention.",
          "This sea cliff is said to resemble a pleated kilt. A popular stopping point, there is a parking lot next to the waterfall which tumbles straight down to the pebbled shore below.",
          "spectacular views of the cliffs and ocean, this is really breathtaking place, well worth to visit.Please be aware it IS windy!",
          "Nice quick stop on way to Quiraing, can just quickly get out of car, take the pics of this beauty spot and move on, there was a piper there playing, much to the tourists delight, adequate parking, busy stop, a couple of tourist buses arrived just as we left, the waterfall and",
          "This beautiful waterfall drops from an amazing cliff and you view it from the top of another rock formation. There is a nice, safe viewing area where you can test your phobia by looking straight down the cliff into the rocky cliffside ocean below! Not for the faint of heart!!!!",
          "Though this is a normal stop on the Trotternish Peninsula, it is still worth a visit everytime. It takes a bit of squinting to see the pattern in the rocks but once you do, it is so obvious.",
          "There is a nice parking area, which doesn't happen often, where you can stop to get out and walk around, or just stand and gaze for a bit. Because there is a nice parking area, you may have to share with a tour bus or two, but the scene is well worth the effort. When we were",
          "Oh, there it is. That was my reaction when I spotted it. We were driving by and spotted some tour buses stopped, so we ventured in. It only took a few minutes, so from a time perspective, it was worth the stop.",
          "I spent about 30 minutes here. I listened to the water for a bit and admired the view. There are some beautiful views as you walk along the fence to the right of the waterfall viewing area. So spend a few more minutes to check it out. Enjoy.",
          "We visited Kilt Rock at the end of May on not a very pleasant day. In between the heavy rain showers and little spots of blue sky, it got very windy. It was still very busy and after taking a minute to find a parking space, we braved the wind to see the rock. As we",
          "Enjoyed my visit here. Our tour guide gave us some interesting info on the area which was very helpful. Nice views and photo opps here. There was a piper playing which gave a nice atmosphere to the attraction.",
          "Wonderful place to get out to stretch your legs and enjoy some wonderful scenery even on a rainy day but always windy to blow away the cobwebs",
          "This was great quick stop. The rock face and falls are fantastic. You can pull in and take a quick look. Great pictures.",
          "Sufficient parking when we were there. Though the influx of one coach certainly swelled the numbers looking at the view, but we could stay longer and peace resumed! Fabulous views across to the mainland, of the coastal cliffs and waterfall. Don't forget to look inland across",
          "As you drive the Trotternish Peninsula, its worth the time to take the turn off and see Kilt Rock. Named for the way the rock looks like the folds in a kilt, this is a popular stop along the Peninsula driving route. You can stop and go, or linger a little longer overlooking the",
          "It's not a dead-on view of the waterfall, but a view from the side. But gorgeous! I love the history behind it - that a giant fought/out-smarted an Irish prince, and in celebration, slapped his gigantic kilt against the rock, and this is how kilt rock was formed. :)",
          "Worth a quick stop. Stunning views of the cliffs and the falls. Can be very windy. Really enjoyed the stop.",
          "We stopped here because everybody else was and walked to the edge and were rewarded with this beautiful waterfall. Easy short walk. Do it.",
          "NIce sized car park and an easy walk to the observation point. It is a very pretty view. There is no way to hike to the bottom of the cliff from the observation point though.",
          "I assumed, like many of the other things on Isle of Skye, that we'd be trekking a little ways. But this is the best view for the least amount of effort! There's an easy car park and viewing station right off the highway, and you can get some beautiful pictures of the waterfall.",
          "This is a remote location and the viewing point of the Falls is at quite an awkward angle. To get a good photo of the falls without the chainlink fence in it, you will need to hold your camera out over the ocean. We went on a relatively clear day but it was still very windy.",
          "A little car park with a viewing area, it's a quick stop to look at the falls dropping into the sea and Kilt rock. Good for a look and photo.",
          "Not only is the actual formation of Kilt Rock a wonder, but the cliff side waterfall is just a sight to behold. Bring your binoculars and telephoto lenses as there are lots of nesting birds in the cliffs here. Also, this apparently is a hot spot for the finding of dinosaur",
          "Though it's a bit hard to see from top viewpoint. The falls were flowing steadily when we stopped by. Plenty of car parking nearby",
          "Vertical lines in the rock suggest the pleats of a kilt? OK but I found the waterfall plungingfrom the top of the cliff to the shore more spectacular",
          "Nice view. There have got to be better water falls somewhere. You have to look way over to your left over the fence to see the falls. It was okay I guess.",
          "Nice place worthwhile a short stop. Pictures you can find look typically better than the real thing. Not so impressive as I thought. It is nice but there a many things on Skye much more worth a visit than this one. That being said, it lies next to the main road so have a look",
          "It is basically a cliff edge with a waterfall. Situated just by the highway, it is an extremely peaceful and quiet place....endless ocean and the horizon. ...need I say more??!!",
          "This was one of those must see stops on my partners list to see on the island, A magnificent location and well worth the visit if you are in Skye. The place is very easily accessible from the main road, You can't miss it on your way to Quiraing. Worth stopping by for a photo a",
          "It is a must visit place and it won't take much time to visit as it is right across the road. You have small car parking, it will be crowded on busy time. You can stop here for about 10 -20 minutes to see the falls and take some pictures. Keep driving after passing Old Mann of",
          "Very lovely views. Not too far from portree, great for a stop over. I wouldn't deliberatly drive to see it tough. Only if you are in the area or close by. It is very stunning and i interesting history behind it.",
          "Nice waterfall with kilt rock view. Interesting to learn about the history and dinosaurs. It's only view point so not much time needed. Good to combine with other attractions on the same route.",
          "After a good amount of rain Kilt Rock waterfall was in good flow. Don't just look at the waterfall & leave walk along the cliff top a short way & enjoy the views.",
          "Very nice location, very easy to drive to. When arriving you've got to an amazing area. Sure is a must-see in Scotland!",
          "There is a small car park and then a scenic viewpoint which gives you a wonderful view of the coastline and Kilt Rock.",
          "The views from here are fab and the waterfall and cliff-coastline with white waves breaking against it make for great photos. We turned up in low season and there was still a crowd there from a coach tour taking lots of photos so if you come in high season be prepared for that.",
          "We visit kilt rock on the saturday,it was very not busy day.lovely enjoyed the views and to look at waterfull.with the funny noise .'mac n cheese' from the caff was delicios,very nice foods.",
          "Wet and windy but worth getting a little damp to see. There was a coffee van too. At the bottom of the fall we could see rainbows. It was freezing but still beautiful",
          "Was quite windy on the day but the view was still good. April not the busiest season but still quite a lot of visitors.",
          "You can't miss it on your way to Quiraing. Worth stopping by for a photo it can be very busy depending on the time the Black Sheep food truck on the parking place is to die for, go for it !!! Everything is super tasty !!",
          "we arrived to see the views of kilt rock in our hire car on a sunday.the parking is a mess mainly due to the way people have parked but it is a tiny car park.we walked around and enjoyed the views of the kilt rock columns from the view point,the waterfull is also so",
          "A magnificent location and well worth the visit if you are in Skye. The place is very easily accessible from the main road and has parking. A short walk (no more than 40m) brings you to a viewpoint where you will see the Kilt Rock in the background and The wonderfull Mealt",
          "Watch for cars in the car park... we left a reasonable gap between us and the next car as the wind was very strong and we didn't want to lose control of the door and hit another car. Went off to see the waterfall and returned to find someone else had squeezed up and damaged our",
          "I wasn't expecting much when we pulled over to stop. Then I saw the waterfall. The wind blows so hard you almost blow over. The waterfall is so beautiful!!!",
          "There's only a small car park so you may have to wait for a slot. The view of the basalt columns said to resemble the pleats of a kilt is nice and you have to crane your neck to see the waterfall close by. However, the spot is becoming very busy with even a fast food van taking",
          "The waterfall is just off the main road as you head away from Portree using the road through the town centre. It is around a 25 minute drive but it is worth it.",
          "Stunning view but a bit too commercialised with one minute stop tourist busses and a burger van aside. Would be nice to have a chance for a wee wander or a stroll but it is all fenced up.",
          "Since you need to drive around Skye, you should stop, take the view or take photos here. The fall is coming from a pond that you do not know before that water will become a nice fall !!!",
          "Stopped off at Kilt Rock when travelling along this coastline. The cliffs are some of the oldest in Europe and the coastline is extremely impressive. Good signage to tell of the history of the area and that dinosaur footprints have been found nearby.",
          "Wet, windy day but well worth the stop. Hard to find superlatives to describe all the attractions on Skye - this is just \"another one\". The Island is amazing and there are so many wonderful vistas I suggest you try and get to see as many a you can but take time to appreciate as",
          "Better to go in winter, so you don't need to share the view with thousands of tourists. The place itself has a fantastic atmosphere, it is impossible not to enjoy. Of course the fench you cannot see in the pictures actually spoiled a bit the view, but in general it's more than",
          "We were lucky to find rainbows in the sky when we visited Kilt Rock. However, this view point is really easy to access. And t is definitely worth taking 10-15 minutes to just stand around, admire the views, take some pictures! A must visit for anyone going to Skye.",
          "I loved witnessing this attraction. It is something to behold. It appears from no where and is very dramatic.",
          "Its a rough tough end of the World type feeling with the wind hammering into your face. I can see why they needed to concrete plinth and railings but its far from sympathetic to the scenery. However, as a natural landmark well worth a stop!",
          "That place is worth of short stop while passing by. There is a small car park and terrace for making a picture of cliff and waterfall.",
          "No time on Skye is complete without a visit to Kilt Rock. Important to watch the offshore wind and keep self & belongings safe & secure. Always memorable.",
          "A great visit to one of the strangest water falls I've ever seen. From a Loch at the top of a cliff straight into the sea Hold onto that camera tight though",
          "Easy to find car park right next to the waterfall amazing views and viewpoints to take photos. A must see if visiting skye.",
          "Hard to appreciate from the viewpoint of the tourist area because of the dangerous cliffs. There is a fenced area that protrudes out somewhat. There were several vehicles and tour buses there but people were great, taking turns and sharing the space. I think viewing the",
          "Easy access. There is a parking next to it. So you can take your time to enjoyed the sightseeing. I recommend it ! A must see on Skye island.",
          "The waterfall is just off the road in a well set out car park. The waterfall itself is about 10 metres from the car park gate. There are excellent views across water and surrounding islands. A must visit for anyone going to Skye",
          "We disembarked from the bus at what looked to be a quite isolated spot and walked through a gate up to the fence and looked out over an amazing vista encompassing a Beautiful waterfall on one side, on the other a cliff with a vague path leading away into the distance down to",
          "This is on every tourist route it seems, but it is a lovely view and worth a quick stop for a stunning view. It is child friendly.",
          "I enjoy waterfalls wherever I find them and this is beautiful. Skye is just the most beautiful place.",
          "The drive to here is very scenic and worth the trip. There are information plaques and ideal photo opportunities. Thank goodness for the safety barrier... its really rather windy.",
          "Easy off the road location. Unusual formation does look like Kilts. There's is also a waterfall visible from the observation area. On a nice day it's a great view",
          "I have visited this site twice now and on the second visit due to very strong easterly winds it made the waterfall spectacular. The geology on the more distant cliffs is fascinating but you need binoculars to fully appreciate it. Visitors now have a good car park and some",
          "We visited Meallt waterfall in December. Further along the cliff from the fall is Kilt Rock so called because the rock formation is like the folds of a kilt. There is good parking and you get a reasonable view of the falls from the fenced edge of the parking. As we visited in",
          "Very interesting rock formation with steep cliffs and waterfall. Worth to take a stop for some pictures and a short walk",
          "Went here with a bus tour. Extraordinary view even though it was really rainy and windy. I was amazed by the sheer amount of water that runs through the small creek downwards to the cliff. It's a really amazing view and if you're short on time you should stop by this place to",
          "Visited Kilt Rock at the weekend on our tour around Skye. The waterfall was in full raging flow and didn't disappoint. The angle that you view the waterfall from makes it look like it appears from the rock. Would love to see the full effect from the sea as the rock formation",
          "What can I say about a wonder such as that ? Only that God is perfect !! When u are looking at that you can feel all the power, the strengh, the energy !!! Amazing !",
          "A great stop with tremendous scenic views looking north and south along the cliff side shore. The waterfall is very beautiful. When driving up east side of Skye, north of Portree, you can easily stop at the readily available parking lot and take in the sights in less than 30",
          "Kilt rock is a nice place to stop on your journey for lunch and just a quick break from walking! The rock is situated next to the sea, and the view point is wonderful. Luckily again we caught it at a quiet time of the year, and basically had the viewpoint to ourselves. I highly",
          "Pretty waterfall views and fun music (you'll understand when you get there). A nice drive along the way to lots of Skye highlights.",
          "Beautiful views though it was blowing a literal gale would love to visit again next time we are here.",
          "The best attraction in Skye. A beautiful art of the nature. You must see it. And also know a bit more about the natural history of Skye.",
          "A magical view when viewed from above, a short walk brings you to the edge of the cliff from stunning views from a great height, the sea spread out before you in all its glory and power, it is advisable to arrive well dressed cold days.",
          "That is a place for meditation of wild beauty just you the sky thegrey cold sea the rock I spent one hour in silence in the company of Angels",
          "We made a halt here for a couple of minutes! The waterfall is huge and the views and scenery is absolutely breathtaking!",
          "This was one of those must see stops for me and it was really worth it!. It is just a short stop and it has some pretty views. It is right of the main road so it is a short stop with a little car park. The kilt patterns are a pretty picture and the Mealt falls are pretty as",
          "Impressive view of the waterfall but nothing super amazing. If you're on the road and pass it stop, get out, and snap and picture. That's about all the time you'll need.",
          "This is an easily accessible natural phenomenon, stunning to see and well worth the trip. Well sign posted and with interesting information about how the rock was formed geologically. Beautiful views across to Raasay, Rona and the mainland.",
          "The rock cliffs resembling the kilt patterns with the Mealt Falls are a great sight. The official car park with its fencing will get you great views and good photo opportunities. You don't need to spend to much time, but even in the off season we found it to be a bit busy,",
          "Worth a visit if you're in the area. Can get busy and there is limited parking. Good views of kilt rock, though best seen on a clear day. Also worth crossing the road to see the views.",
          "Visited in February when we stayed at the fantastic Duisdale hotel. We literally had 4 seasons in the 10 minutes we were there, but it is worth the short trip off the main road to have a look. As other reviews note, there is a small car park, and if it was busy, I maybe would",
          "Not much to do here apart from see the waterfall but it is well worth a visit as ver impressive. Car park is tiny so if more into walking I suggest planning this into your route.",
          "We stopped here as we were in the area. The car park is smallish with no marked spaces but it is right next to the cliff so not far to walk to get a view of the waterfall and the rock. The scenery is really good. The waterfall is good to see from the edge. I would say this",
          "We visited kilt rock last year but didn't stay long as we were staying on mainland Scotland. As this time we had accommodation just up the road from kilt we saw it several times throughout the week. best times to go are sunset or sunrise it turns the place and views so",
          "It was tipping down with rain when we visited but even that failed to dampen the wonder of these majestic falls. Watch the water crashing over the cliffs into the sea below, creating swirling mists as it hits the rocks below. What a sight. A must-do on Skye. We visited in",
          "Tons of tour buses but the view from both sides was worth it. It was rather windy but I did get some amazing pictures.",
          "A sheer drop waterfall from an escarpment onto the rocks beside the sea. We had fine though windy weather and the waterfall looked amazing with a good flow. Access is easy with a boardwalk right to the viewpoint.",
          "We visited in pouring rain on a windy day - which only added to the dramatic and wild beauty of Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls!!",
          "Amazing place. Just awesome. Not to be missed! Went there with friends who'd been there before. Something that you don't see everyday!",
          "almost gave this place a miss as the weather was so bad over the couple of days we were here. just when we were about to leave..the weather turned good and we decided to make a trip here from portree. well worth it as it wasn't far and the scenery was beautiful as usual in",
          "The parking area is close to the viewing area. The am and pm colors and photo options are fantastic. Food cart in lot when we stopped also. Nice spot for picnic.",
          "If your driving on the Trotternish Peninsula, you should certainly stop here. In addition to the main attraction, the view back across the road is worth the stop in itself. The short walk to the end of the path rewards with a stunning view. If you don't find it to be so, you",
          "Spectacular sea cliff. An amazing view point on the road between Portree and Staffin, Isle of Skye. Worth to visit. It seems to resemble a kilt. It was a rainy day, it was also very cloudy and windy but the stunning views to the waterfall and sea remained.",
          "This is my top waterfall that I have ever seen! Lovely scenery, easy access with the parking beside it makes it a great place to visit while you are in Skye!",
          "We made a loop around the Trotternish Peninsula, stopping at Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls. Took many pictures that just can't do it justice. Totally enjoyed the scenery and the piper who started playing just before we left. Very windy, but a beautiful sunny day. Just lovely!",
          "This place is worth a visit if you are driving past but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. You will not spend long here, it is basically a photo stop, with a waterfall that goes in to the sea and a coloured rock face.",
          "Kilt Rock had the best parking lot of all attractions. At first we couldn't see that was good about this besides the cliffs.... then we saw the waterfall. It was an easy walk and a quick stop",
          "Enjoyed the trip to this quite unique waterfall, but the weather made the visibility a bit difficult for us. The drive to get to the waterfall is on a lot of 1 lane roads with lay bys for passing other direction traffic. But the view from this point to all of the Scottish",
          "We called at Kilt Rock on our travels around the Island. There is an excellent viewing gallery and plenty of car parking.",
          "The waterfall is easily accessible and can be viewed from a lookout which is just next to a parking area. It drops right into the sea. Because it is in a windy coastal area, water from the waterfall is blown into the air if it is windy and may never reach the bottom. It is quite",
          "We wisited Kilt Rock with guided tour and it really was an amazing experience. Little park with view over the cliffs and when you lean a bit over the fence, you see stunning waterfall, roaring over the edge. Fence is high and secure enough, but still is recommended to take",
          "Probably a 15 minute stop. The view is very prettying! Small parking lot, close to the area of viewing. A place to just reflect and enjoy the sights and sounds.",
          "Just off the main road and well sign posted. Great roomy car park. The kilt rock is huge and named as it looks like a kilt. The waterfall is also good with a fair drop.",
          "While I don't quite see the resemblance to a kilt, the waterfall and surrounding area is quite lovely. You can really only get a side-angle shot of the falls from the lookout point itself, but it's good. There's a great view of the cliffs around and the sea. Also, when we went",
          "This is amazing. You have no idea where the waterfall is until you get to the edge and lean over Beautiful area Isle of skye is filled with natural beauty Every point of isle of skye is a must see",
          "It was a sunny October when we went here, it was a short visit, but well worth the visit to see this views.",
          "A sea cliff waterfall that is stunning to see. Close to the road, the access is easy and it is very safe to access a clear view.",
          "The waterfall was really nice to see. The drive to get here was very scenic. The car park is steps away from the waterfall and there is a flat walk / viewing point for pictures. It's a quick stop not much else to do here. However, there are other attractions on the same road",
          "Found this by chance, was not even aware of its existence and have been to Skye a few times! Good parking facilities, yet again another fantastic photo opportunity and something else crossed off the bucket list.",
          "Driving is definitely the best way to travel around in Skye! You get all the time and flexibility to choose where you want to stop by and how long you want to spend there. The views are utterly amazing! Diving conditions can be quite tricky as there are parts that are really",
          "A short drive from the roadside & then an even shorter walk takes you to the waterfall. Even though there hadn`t been much rain lately it was still a spectacular sight. Its vertical drop down to the sea would be even better with a greater volume of water. Leaning out over the",
          "Stunning views on a stunning day!! Long drive but worth it!! Lots to see en route to break up the journey!! Well worth it!!",

        "google": [
          "This place is stunning to stop at. The car park isnt the biggest and in summer i imagine the viewing platform will get busy but it is definitely worth it for a view of the cliffs and the waterfall. There is also a bit of info on the fossils and dinosaur footprints found in the area",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful lookout. Maybe there is more do explore in this area, as we were there only a short while; however, a lookout with history behind it is difficult to rate above a 3/5. This is not intended to read as negative, more that it\u2019s a great stop along the way but probably not the destination.",
          "Reasonable car park. Good viewing location and helpful signage. (Very windy top)",
          "A good viewpoint alongside Mealt Falls close to Kilt Rock. It is a popular spot which can get busy, especially with the lone piper and the burger van also resident at this tourist spot. The waterfall is impressive but best viewed from the \u2026",
          "This is one of the few waterfalls in the UK that land straight into the sea. It's definitely with a visit, right by the main road. \n\nAlthough you can't see loads because you're on the cliff edge, to really appreciate it you'd need to be on the sea or air.",
          "Interesting place on Earth where the waterfall is falling right in to sea. Parking lot is right next to it so it's accessible for everyone. I would recommend to reserve 30 minutes for this nature wonder.",
          "Beautiful place. There an amazing waterfall falling from the cliff directly into the sea and it's just magical. It's very windy tho, so careful with you hats!",
          "Good for a quick 10 minute stop over on the A855. It\u2019s basically a viewing platform to see the waterfall from a distance. Try and go early, later in the day it gets very crowded with tour buses and there\u2019s just one small viewing platform. \u2026",
          "Lovely place, very windy but beautiful views",
          "Beautiful.place to visit. We spent the day driving around the north part of the island stopping at different beauty spots. The scenery and the views here were really breathtaking and I thoroughly recommend a visit.",

          "For those who usually don't see many waterfalls (like me) this is an impressive pace to stop on a trip through the Skye Isle. Of course the highlands are full of waterfalls but this one is going directly to the sea. With a beautiful \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, free to visit and free to park. Just be weary of the potholes as we had to help someone push their car out of a puddle. There's a very fair priced van selling hot drinks and food, me and my boyfriend enjoyed two cups of tea and had a chat with the lovely woman running it, named Catherine/Cathryn I think \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Great place to visit first time in scotland. You can do amazing photos there. Usually full of tourists.",
          "Very nice. Worth a visit. Natural lake flowing into the sea. Free to park! Welcome to isle of Skye.",
          "Very easy to get to, beautiful views and plenty of space for big groups to all see together.",
          "Nice enough. Raining when I was there so not ideal. Quite an impressive waterfall though only really visible from one side at the top. A small viewing platform and, as usual, crowded with bus loads of people. Worth stopping if you're \u2026",
          "weather played a spoil sport. good view and great scenery. it was super cold. but best part is a lovely lady selling fresh hot coffee at the entrance. buy a cup and enjoy the falls!!!",
          "Beautiful waterfall and great cliff, which forms the coastline. You can get some really nice photo shots here, although the driving is slightly tough and there are not many parking space.",
          "Beautiful view. Easy to find too! If you drive on the A855 then you'll find the sign easily. Best go early to have the view to yourself!! Went around 9am and had the whole place to myself! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A lovely viewing point worth a visit, the only downside is that the parking is somewhat limited and muddy. When we visited it was just after some bad weather so there were puddles everywhere and the ground was quite rutted. However, that said the views up and down the coast were worth it.",
          "Car park full of pot holes and a very small viewing platform means this place gets crowded real fast. The waterfall and cliff backdrop is nice but when you have 50 other people all trying to improve the view with a pouty face side profile and one bent leg it gets irritating quickly. Take your photos and move on",
          "So majestic. The review is supposed to be only for the falls but can't hold myself back from recommending this little food truck near the parking that sells insanely good haggis. \u2665\ufe0f",

          "Lovely views. Would want to revisit next time we come to Skye. Unfortunately it was raining heavily and very windy on our visit so we only stopped a short while. Popular destination for coaches too. Ample parking and good viewing points",

          "Great location best to visit off season when less tourists",
          "Parking is insane during busy season. I watched as trailers and tour buses chose to block off the entire lot.  View was just ok. You couldn\u2019t really see the falls very well. The cliff side on either side was spectacular. The parking was \u2026",
          "Nice views. Easy walk from the parking. When we went the falls was just a trickle, but still worth the visit!",

          "Breath taking view. Visually stunning.",
          "This is a rock formation and a waterfall,  the rock resembling a Kilt with the pleats around it. The views are spectacular on a clear day but it gets really busy at times. The parking is something to be desired when it gets busy as you have \u2026",
          "Very beautiful and unique waterfall on skye! This is a must see when u are here. musical sounds that was produced by the winds on the cliffs could be heard. This place is just amazing!",

          "Parking lot small especially with tour buses coming in. Actual point to view the falls is small and crowded. There was a cute food truck and man playing bagpipes when we visited. Beautiful landscape views.",
          "Well, if you are nearby you might visit this waterfall, which looks great but if you want take photos, this might not be the best place. The view towards the east is very nice too on a clear day.",
          "Some people can get creative with their photos of the water fall. Snot out of the nose, water coming out of your mouth, etc. Pretty place to hear the waterfall.",

          "Stunning.... Nothing more to say",

          "Nice stop as it's just off the main road. Small car park - I only just managed to get a space so would imagine it gets very busy in summer. Viewing area is a little of an awkward position as you need to lean over to really see the falls and \u2026",

          "This is an amazing phenomena, however the lookout does not give you a good view of the falls because obviously they are both on the cliff edge! Needs a cantilevered deck so you can look back towards the falls not just sideways. Car park needs resurfacing as very large potholes evident on verges so be cautious when parking.",
          "Nice falls right by the parking lot. The viewing angle is not the best as it's right on the side of the coastline.",

          "easy stop while driving for a cool waterfall and cliffside view. parking was free.",
          "Unbelievably windy and taking when we went,  but the drive there was beautiful like most of western Scotland.",
          "Simply a giant waterfall next to the never ending ocean making for a stunning view, luckily you don't have to pay for this one, you just park and go see it. There was a man playing bagpipes when I went which just added to the atmosphere.",
          "Nice view of fall into the sea. Not much to walk. Just good for few clicks",
          "Beautiful views, but with the amount of money tourism brings to Skye, they should spend some money on the approach and parking",
          "Great view on waterfall near Kilt rock on isle of Skye. You can see waterfall, Raasay island and lots of sea.",
          "Such a beautiful place! Must see",
          "I wouldn't say this is a destination in its own right, but definitely something to stop and see if you're driving by. Great views of the cliffside, including Kilt Rock and the falls, from the viewing platform. Tends to be busy on nice days.",
          "Beware of tourists in unfamiliar cars who stop where they like, park where they like and walk where they like. Once you finally get to the falls and kilt rock, the views are amazing.",
          "Nice view, too many tourists tho, I'd advice to go during off peak hours",
          "Great views. Very strong wind. Waterfalls not very big but unique. Recommend.",
          "Happy little waterfall, a bit overhyped though. Only visit it after six pm or off-season, otherwise enjoy hours of waiting, trying to get to the parking lot - extremely crowded!",
          "It's cool, but the drive there is better, and the drive after was too! It can be crowded during tourist times.",
          "Great place to stop off when traveling around Skye. There are great views and the waterfall is very impressive.",
          "Nice view of the waterfall. Ate a delicious haggis on a roll at the foodtruck, while listening to a gorgeous Scot playing bagpipes",
          "Kilt rock is in isle of skye with free parking stunning views and  food van shop",
          "WOW doesn't begin to describe the views and vistas!",
          "The weather is horrible when I visit the place, but it is beautiful anyway. No horrible weather can change this fact.",
          "This is one of the fall at the Skye. You can also see the dinosaur footprint",
          "Small free parking area. Great views.",
          "Such a unique falls. Can go all the way near the falls in car.",
          "Nice, accesible by car = lot of people anytime.",
          "Splendid views, if your in the area its a must see.",
          "Gorgeous stop while making the loop to the north in the Isle of Skye. You're a bit askance of the falls, but the views are still spectacular.",
          "Extremely crowded. Really not worth it at all. There are other lookout points that are much less know in the area with better views",
          "Great views,",
          "Very windy and loads of tourists but decent waterfall",
          "Incredible spot and view. Unfortunately the parking is a real nightmare, we have been lucky to find a spot and leave without damages on the vehicle.",
          "Stop. Take the usual picture everyone takes. Leave. \n\nBetter spend your time on more beautiful hidden gems on Skye instead of this place fully packed with tourists.",
          "A bit underwhelming tbh. Nice enough. Had a good look for sea mammals too but no joy.",
          "Spectacular even in horizontal rain",
          "Cool natural point of view. Must be beautiful in summer, cold and windy in winter.\nThe sea gives you some peace\nCompletely safe with kids",
          "dont miss this if on skye. just stunning as most of this island is.",
          "The astonishing place..have to go...",
          "Easy to park though can imagine it gets busy with visitors. The falls are right at the car park.",
          "The natural aspect of this place is undoubtedly great. However, in high season and with coaches full of tourists + crazy wannabe drivers with car rental, this place gets very crowded, sometimes even jammed with no possibility to actually move cars.",
          "Beautiful view easily approachable",
          "If you are near Kilt Rock it is a definitely worth a stop! We've been there at the end if October and there were no people at all. Such a pretty place!",
          "Absolutely beautiful! sadly it was overcrowded and fenced with an ugly fence.",
          "Cool place. Beautiful view.",
          "Very nice spot on the road the the Quiraing's hike\nThe view on the cloud is great",
          "The Isle of Skye is a wonderful place - lots of photo opportunities. Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls are difficult to see well from the cliff edge, but still worth a quick visit",
          "Worth the stop.  Waterfall and rock is impressive.",
          "Worth the visit! Fabulous area of Skye.",
          "Popular tourist viewpoint. Worth stopping at. Magical Piper played perfectly and added to the charisma. He was a well travelled and inspiring chap, who made the time to chat and share a moment, adding value to the visit. Lovely lass serving \u2026",
          "Worth a visit. Great views",
          "Not enough parking, and I wish they would build some kind of balcony or something so you can get an even better view of the falls.",
          "Scenic place to stop by for about 10 mins.",
          "Fanststic scenery",
          "Worth stopping if you are in the area.",
          "Very pretty scenery here.\nVery heavy people and traffic though which totally spoils it.\nCountless tourists all clambering for the same photo.\nAnd the odd busker makes it unappealing.\nRoad is a mess in the car park.\nAvoid if busy",
          "Brilliant views. Wind was strong.",
          "Easy to get to. Nice waterfall nice viewl",
          "Amazing place, watch out the strong wind.",
          "Excellent  view  with  extra blue  skies .",
          "Amazing nature- definitely worth visiting!",
          "There is only one viewpoint on the waterfall from an awkward angle, so a bit disappointing. The cliffs are magnificent though.",
          "A beautiful experience and sight for sure. Dont be too fooled by pictures you see on the internet though. There is a very limited viewing area and if you happen to get there when a crowd does you may not get the picture you want. The drive \u2026",
          "Awsome. Get there before the tourist busses. It was a cloudy day so my photos do not acurately show the beauty of the place.",
          "Great view but very crowed.",
          "Stunning. \nBest view is with a drone though!",

          "Beautiful view. Nothing else there. Photo stop only.",
          "Beautiful Vista!",
          "A very nice place to visit. We thoroughly enjoyed the drive up there. There was even a piper playing when we visited and it really added to the charm of the place. Can get windy and cold so bring a jacket.",
          "Spectacular views, very steep.",
          "Breathtakingly beautiful! This place will leave you stunned.",
          "This is a beautiful spot. The waterfall is not fully visible from the top. The best pictures are taken from the water level. Its a little busy with busses and other people. And the pathway and walkway is quite muddy. The view out to the island and the submarine training area is great.",
          "Easy to access place. Nice stop. Parking is free.",
          "Beautiful spot, good view point where everyone gets to see the waterfall unobstructed",
          "Bus loads of tourists are drawn to this site. Better time your Kodak moments quickly or you will be photo bombed by the tourists who are on a very tight time leash. While it is good to see the source of the falls, I am sure we have all \u2026",
          "Stunning, fantastic viewpoint. Worth stopping if you're passing!",
          "The absolute must-visit place in the isle of Skye",
          "An amazing view, but a bit crowded parking space",
          "Beautiful water fall",
          "Amazing, simply amazing. Bit hard driving but worth it.",
          "Never seen such a beautiful waterfall",
          "While this is not one of Skye\u2019s main attractions, it\u2019s a nice stop if you happen to be in the area (Storr, Quiraing). Was a bit crowded",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Amazing place offering the best views of the huge cliff,  the waterfall. The panaromic views of the surroundings are just amazing. This picturesque place is worthy of watching it here, the pictures does not adequately describe the true beauty to this spot.",
          "Just amazing view. Lost my words",
          "Amazing viewpoint. There's a little snack van, no toilets.",
          "Not as good as made out stayed for 2 mins took pics and went on, bout 10 mins to the right tho brill bit",
          "Lovely place to stop and just take in the scenery.",
          "Nice but nothing much there but a viewing platform to see a small waterfall",
          "Unfortunatly we had a bit fog, when we visit Kilt Rock, but even then, the drive to the waterfall was even better because of this weather condition and we still could see the waterfall and the sea in which it falls.",
          "Great place, to. See waterfall fall. Into the sea",
          "An iconic waterfall that splashes down into brilliantly blue seas. The car park is fairly small but that is only likely to be an issue in the summer months. The location is very much a viewpoint, with little else to do right there, but the \u2026",
          "Big waterfall, must be great to see from the sea. Many tourists.",

          "Good views lovely scenery",
          "Lovely falls and views.",
          "Very pretty landscape falls are quite we small",
          "It's ok, but gets stupid busy so go early or late. Very small parking area, we saw cars queuing on the road to get in.",
          "Beautiful and majestic, and a also must see if you're visiting Skye",
          "On a sunny day, great viewpoint.",
          "Rewarding views of waterfall and kilt cliffs. The nearby, paved parking makes this very easy to get too, and would be easy enough with buggies or wheelchairs. There are railings/barriers making it pretty safe with young children. There was \u2026",
          "Wonderful views, but watch your hat.",
          "Nice but it's difficult to see the fall...",
          "Wasn\u2019t that busy here, good place to stop for a quick break and grab drink from nearby mobile catering van.",
          "Natural beauty at its very best. Cannot describe this place, you need to come experience it for yourself.",
          "Great viewpoint right by the highway between quiraing and portree. It has parking. Easy to stop. Amazing views of the kilt rock and the falls",
          "Beautiful but very busy",
          "Super beautiful rest area, it also has a mobile coffee shop allowing you to buy coffee, tea, or any other snacks if you're feeling peckish.",
          "Great spot, the waterfall is nice depending on how much water is flowing.",
          "Falls are right next to the car park. Beautiful views!",
          "Great. No midgets",
          "Gorgeous. A must.",
          "Incredible views of clifts and a beautiful waterfall",
          "Beautiful spot to visit, it was very windy so the sound was awesome and carried very well.",
          "Nice view AT the ocean, very lovely falls, and very amazing cliffs.\nYou should go there very early or late, cause there are a lot of tourist going there by coaches",
          "Great place and amazing views. Unfortunately for us we had the driest times so not enough water for the falls... but even so the cliffs look great...",
          "No one could expect waterfalls directly pouring into the sea from such a high cliff. The parking can be a lot busy but it's worth stopping by, especially when it's so close to the main road. Scotland keeps on giving while not bragging too much about its wonderful places.",
          "Stunning views.  Nice place for a picnic in the summer time.",
          "Great views of the falls and landscape!",
          "Absolutely stunning views, both of the waterfall and the surrounding cliffside.\n\nThe fence will whistle if its very windy to.",

          "Stunningly beautiful, well worth the drive",
          "Ok, very short walk from car park",
          "This place is so easy to view great place to stop and visit when on Isle of Skye a few parking spaces are around it\u2019s a great place just to chill have a walk around area very easy to find as not many roads on sky and it\u2019s well signed posted",
          "Visiting this place is definitely a must, very easy access and the views are breathtaking.",
          "Very nice, and always big wind!",
          "Beautiful views, learn a bit about the age of rock formations",
          "The views can be spectacular (depending on the weather). The infrastructure of the viewpoint is rather non-existent. A convenient stop to have a sandwich and a cup of tea.",
          "Skye is an absolutely amazing place. But this wasn't really worth stopping by. The view is ok, parking is a joke, way too many people",
          "Great views of the sea and the waterfall which falls into the sea is magnificent. Must visit place as it is easy to access from the main road. The car park might overflow during the peak times as it was almost full during the off peak season we went there.",
          "Worth the effort to get there.",
          "This place needs to be retarded and parking lot to be extended and marked out properly.\nNice view",
          "Sometimes crowded with tourists, but beautiful sights",
          "Great views of the waterfall and coastline.  Easy to see from the car park although to get the best photos you do kind of need to get close to the edge of the cliffs.  Is just as impressive in real life as the photos if not more so.",
          "A view point on the falls. There is not much to do around but the snap some photos with the falls and the shoreline",
          "Need to go back after rainfall. The falls were not at their best.",
          "Stunning views in Scotland",
          "Great waterfall. Would be even nicer to see this spectacular piece from the water :)",
          "Super views out to sea from here",
          "Nice view, small parking....",
          "Somehow as impressive as the pictures, which can't be said of other places around the island, which are so grand, you can't take a picture that properly represents that place. It's a stop that's worth your time if you're driving to or from \u2026",
          "Nice viewpoint with a waterfall on the left and the remains of hexagonal stone pillars in the water. It's possible to spot whales and dolphins at least until mid August. Parking is a bit messy, just like at the other stops.",
          "Arrived on lucky blue sky beautiful day. Sensational Isle of Skye. But hard to find toilet",
          "Beautiful views, wasn't to busy this time of the year",
          "Great place to stop by",
          "Very windy when we stopped by here. Could not even hold my phone steady to take any good pictures, while trying not to be blow over edge. Family that was just leaving struggled to open the doors on one side of their car due to the wind.\n\nStill pretty nice views, might try to return in slightly better weather.",
          "Beautiful but so crowded when we were there",

          "Beautiful views in an almost untouched location.",
          "Excellent scenic beauty",
          "Beautiful, but overrated. There are hordes of tourists stopping here continuously and this makes it almost a place to avoid.",
          "Breathtaking",
          "Nice view of the waterfall.",
          "A nice stop off if you're already driving the road up to the Quaraing, but wouldn't come just for this. There was a nice van serving hot drinks and small snacks as well. ",
          "Stunning",
          "It is a lovely stopover place that grants a great view of the sea. The waterfall is not great but still worth stopping by for the beautiful views. It does not have any coffee shops or other recreational buildings, so expect to spend a maximum of 15 mins. ",
          "Better when it rains a little more",
          "Was kind of disappointing to see in may, there wasn't much of a waterfall.",

          "Nice rock formations, but a bit crowded",
          "Really nice",
          "Sure worth the trip there",
          "It's actually quite hard to see the waterfall - you need to get right against the barrier to get a view, and even then it's on an extreme angle.  It was quite crowded, so you had to wait to get near the fence for a view.  It's right on the \u2026",
          "Great viewpoint, totally ruined by the psychotic hoards of tour buses coming in one after the other non stop. \nTry and go in the morning to avoid this",

          "Amazing sight to see we were very lucky beautiful day car park free",

          "Probably the most touristy place on Skye. Parking lot with lots of buses. The view isn't great either. Go to the Lealt falls viewpoint just around the corner instead for something way better.",
          "Well worth a visit when on skye. The pictures dont give credit to the size and setting of the water fall. A must see without a doubt.  ",

          "This beach is very different to what you see on the drive round Skye and the watercolour is quite tropical.",
          "in sharp contrast with Skye's splendour. It's a nice little beach with remarkable tropical water colour yet, that's about it.",
          "My wife and went here just after Christmas it was about 10am when we got there and there wasn\u2019t a soul around the whole couple of hours we spent there, it\u2019s a bit of drive but once in the car park there it was easy enough to get to, it\u2019s definitely worth a visit we saw seals",
          "Car park is very small and has huge pot holes so beware!! It\u2019s a good 15-20mins walk from the car park to the coral beach, if you get to the black beach, just go over the hill you can see in front of you and from there the coral beach will be visible. We went on Boxing Day,",
          "we took our dog a walk out to the beach which was very nice but as is typical with skye in the middle of summer parking was a nightmare with people all over the place and cars stuck in ditches almost on there sides which lets it down a bit",
          "Really nice walk along the coast line to reach the coral beach, its only a mile way and with a path not too strenuous. It's a 'white beach' white from the coral fragments and shells also a nice place to paddle in the clear sea water of Loch Dunvegan",
          "This was the prettiest walk we did. It in a beautiful coral beach full of shells and coral fragments. The parking is small and the road to get there is super narrow.",
          "Easy free parking and a mile long stroll to reach this beautiful bay with far reaching views. Crystal blue and icy cold water and white sand bordered by sheep grazed fields. A real gem and on a warm day ideal for a picnic.",
          "Perfect place to take your dog although you must keep them on Leads which if you are not a very big fan it\u2019s great.Carry on across path all the way not far very clean and amazing shells and clear water.You would not expect it to be that crystal blue water colour but it is it\u2019s",
          "One of the worst roads to get here and when we arrived we managed to get the last parking place. This is a popular beach and would be more challenging in the summer. The walk from the car park is straight some little inclines and streams and its an easy mile walk along the",
          "So parking can be a little \u201ctight\u201d, and the walk is another mile or more. However with great risk comes great reward. Imagine sending your friends back home pictures that would make Caribbean travels jealous. Sure the water is colder, but that didn\u2019t stop me from going in up",
          "We visited in September and although the car park was full when we arrived it wasn\u2019t in chaos and a short wait resulted in a space as at this time of year there is a regular turnover of people doing the walk there and back rather than spending the day there. It\u2019s clear that",
          "The roads to get to this place are the usual poor potholed affair that you can encounter when off the beaten track. We\u2019ve been before and loved it but on this visit we had to turn back as there was no parking. All spaces were full and people were even parking where they should",
          "an incredible stretch of white beach consisting of dead coral shells a little busy (us tourists) but well worth the walk to it from the nearest parking field",
          "The day I visited was very wet, so I probably didn't see it at its best. However, it was a very pleasant walk and the bonus was thtat I did get to see a sea eagle!!",
          "Very nice. What the guide books don't tell you is about the parking chaos, which detracts entirely from the experience. The car park is a disgrace. The island's council should hold its head in shame. For a community that is so dependent on tourism, this is a disgrace(as with",
          "Our Family visited here 1 day in July, The Walk to the beach is a good 20 minutes but well worth it, the scenery is stunning with pure clear water. The main concern is the car parking, it is atrocious, its a single carriageway with passing places to drive to the car park but",
          "Beach is stunning but as per usual wherever you go theese camper vans spoilt it No that\u2019s only can\u2019t they park Sometimes 4 space it appears rules and regulations don\u2019t seem to apply or just blatant can\u2019t read or we didn\u2019t see the signs This isn\u2019t just here it\u2019s all over",
          "We visited the coral beach around 2pm as we had been doing other things that morning . If your not good with small roads then I wouldn\u2019t attempt this , and if your a camper then all I will say on this is well done ! regarding parking i would say arrive early as there is about",
          "Single track road from Dunvagen Castle to the \u201cCar park\u201d (small thin strip of path) which is totally inappropriate for camper-vans or larger cars. Result was total chaos with people being blocked in and cars stacked up down the farm road for a considerable wait. Urgently needs",
          "No idea what the beach was like, due to inconsiderate tourists in camper vans parking (and picknicking!) in all the passing places, meaning that getting to the car park was an absolute mission. Once there, there was chaos in the car park, with many cars stuck and unable to",
          "We went at \u2018the worst time\u2019 during peak touristy time in August - yet even so only about 20 other people loitering around the white beach - and yes the parking is bad - but you know what it\u2019s why we\u2019re all there - the wonderful craggy wilderness coast! So take extra time, don\u2019t",
          "Beautiful beach, terrible parking, about a 1 mile walk from parking to beach, but worth it. My child loved it",
          "Parking was a nightmare made worse by impatient people. There are not many spaces, probably no more than 20. It was a lovely walk to the actual beach from the car park, roughly a mile. The beach itself is absolutely stunning. The water is so clear, it could be in the Bahamas.",
          "It takes ~30\u2019 to walk (easy) to the beach (don\u2019t stop at the 1st one you\u2019ll be disappointed) it is quite windy there but we were lucky and had a nice sunny weather there!",
          "The beach is amazing, the views are amazing. But too many visitors cause parking problems, leave lots of litter and give the local farmers a real headache.",
          "Visited with the family late July on a sunny day (early evening thinking it would be less busy). Parking was horrendous!! Locals must hate the tourists and having eventually got parked, walked about a mile to find a small stretch of coast 300meters in length with coral sand and",
          "Lovely beach about 20 minutes walk from car park. Not really suitable for anyone with mobility issues or a pram. The beach is made from coral and has lovely views but was very busy at 11am during peak tourist season. If you are not there first thing in the morning, don\u2019t",
          "We took a taxi from Dunvegan (came back for us when we finished), so avoided the stress of parking. We read the reviews here, and so were happy to arrive at the coral beach full of shells. See my first photo of the ground you walk on. However, after exploring this unique beach,",
          "Although the weather wasn\u2019t brilliant it\u2019s a lovely walk to the beach and, if you\u2019re prepared for a climb, some great views as well. Parking could be a problem in high season so get there early.",
          "We loved this! We did have a most amazing weather day which I think added to the day. We climbed to the top of a very tall hill once we got there that has a fantastic view. I would say parking was very difficult and it was a long walk to the beach but was well worth it!",
          "We had no chance to find any parking space because everything was full of caravans. So we had to drive back.",
          "You\u2019d think you were in the Mediterranean, gazing at the clear waters off Coral Beach. It\u2019s an easy, pleasant walk out. We were fortunate to catch a sunny day, before the crowds. Take a snack, sit on the white sands for a spell and enjoy...",
          "To reach the beach you have to go through a very narrow road and after that a 30 minute walk awaits you before you reach the beach. But it's worth it. One would never expect to find such crystal waters and white sands on a remote corner of a Scottish island, battered by winds",
          "The beach really feels like it doesn't belong. That say, you can't really enjoy a beach on Skye. We were there on the sunniest day that you can get in Scotland and the water was still too cold to swim",
          "There are over 600 reviews about this beach, it is beautiful. Like all of the must-see places on Skye, parking is an issue. I do feel for the local residents. The place is quiet, tranquil and restful, until two drones turned up. The incessant whine of these machines will ruin",
          "Few miles of a challenging drive, then stressful parking then a longer than expected walk to finally arrive at a very small beach. The coral is pretty however the blue water is not as vibrant as is made out. And given its popularity it isn\u2019t an overly quiet beach. Worth seeing",
          "This is an interesting place to visit, but we read the car park is really small so we went early. We arrived at about 9am and grabbed the last space bar one! It's about a 30- to 40-minute walk to the beach, but it's easy enough. There are no toilets here at all though, or",
          "Great place. Maybe, according to the reviews. But in typical Isle of Skye fashion, there are 10 parking spaces at the end of a very poor and windy road. This island just doesn\u2019t cater for the tourists that flock here. We had no option but to turn around and drive back.",
          "Situated near Dunvegan Castle it is well worth investing a couple of hours. Even on a midweek afternoon in May it was busy and as a result parking is limited. But it was definitely worthwhile for a fairly easy coastal walk to a stunning coral beach. Do make the effort to climb",
          "Well worth a visit. Easy walk in once you negotiate the car park!! Beautiful on a sunny day and the extra walk up onto the viewing hill is worth it too. Look out for the seals on the rocks opposite the beach",
          "A visit to Skye would not be complete without a visit to the Coral Beach. Even on a cloudy day it is amazing, although stay for sunshine and the glow is spectacular. We sat and watched seals in the bay and observed a sea otter as we walked back along the path. This is not for",
          "What a striking contrast the sea, sand and black rocks make. It was pretty wonderful. Really enjoyed our visit here. There isn't really any advice needed. Would imagine getting there and parking in the summer to be a bit intense. April was perfect - quiet.",
          "Really enjoyed our afternoon here, walking to the rocks and looking through the rock pools. We climbed to a bit of rock out of the way and saw wild seals! It was an incredible sight, well worth the walk. The white beach is full of seashells and coral and the water is so clear.",
          "I did not expect the beautiful sight that met me on my visit to Coral Bay! Definitely worth a visit. It\u2019s like a tropical beach. Alas even in the sun it was a little chilly!! The colour of the water is also stunning! Even dipped my piggies!! Freeeeezing but worth it! There is a",
          "Gorgeous coral beach. Stunning scenery and plenty to explore. This is a reasonable Walk from the small car park (this is just up the road from Dunvegan on a single track road- lots of passing places) the carpark will get very busy, it was full when we got there at 3pm on a",
          "The walk takes about 1 mile to get to the actual beach but it is worth the work. Gorgeous views of the coastline and the coral beach. We loved it and wanted to do it again!",
          "This is a 1.2 mile walk out to the beach but it goes by quickly as you are looking at all the sights ... the ocean, the cliffs, the cows and the sheep grazing in the area. Dogs are allowed but must be on a leash. It was misty and foggy on our visit but still worth the walk.",
          "What a stunning beach, the water is so clear. this was a highlight of my trip. Glad I was there in March as parking must be a nightmare in the summer!",
          "We followed the narrow single track road to the end and parked in the car park. The car park can\u2019t fit anymore than 15 cars max. Not a problem on a wet weekday afternoon in March but could see why all the farms had signs saying \u201cno parking, access needed at all times\u201d as in",
          "There\u2019s a fair walk in - over half a mile I\u2019d say - but it\u2019s pretty flat & so worth it! You can see the turquoise sea colour on a dull day, but it looks much better with blue skies.",
          "amazing location with beautiful views. The water colour is just spectacular, only accessible by the car park , easy to find",
          "Small car park so if you go in season I suggest that you go early in the day so you\u2019re not disappointed Easy gentle walk through a field to get to the beach so perfect if you are on a family holiday,an easy walk for children It was a bit off putting on the way, the beach\u2019s",
          "Easy walk to this lovely beach with stunning clear water - and seals. Just the right time to visit as hardly anyone around",
          "This is an attractive beach , formed from crushed skeletons of Coralline seaweed rather than true coral ,giving it it's white colour in sunlight in contrast to the black volcanic rocks on this beach and elsewhere. Choose your day to visit wisely - it is best visited on a clear",
          "We loved this beach so much we visited twice on our week holiday! Highly recommend a visit. The beach literally glows :)",
          "I highly recommend stopping here. The walk from the car park was easy going on well marked trails. You get to a black stone beach and then there is a distinct line where the black stone ends and the coral beach begins. And on closer inspecting the \u201csand\u201d isn\u2019t sand at all but",
          "This is a relatively easy walk to the beach and will take approx 30 mins each way. There is limited parking at the end of the track. The walk is through some fields and the path is uneven, can be muddy and wet so walking boots are recommended. When you reach the beach it is",
          "You can park in the small car park but even though it is October it was still pretty busy. The walk to the beach is through farm land but there is a clear path. The path is quite muddy and a bit uneven so good shoes needed. The beach itself is stunning with beautiful coral sand",
          "You park in a small car park it was busy in sept so summer you will struggle parking .A lovely walk through a couple of fields and you arrive at a lovely golden sandy beach,if you time it right with the tides you can walk across to a small island ,good walk and great for dogs.",
          "Easy walk (30 mins) to a beautiful beach. Coral is gorgeous, views are great. Took the dog who loved the walk and the beach itself.",
          "It\u2019s only a 30 minute walk to the beach along an easy path. Nice white coloured beach and blue water, too cold to swim in during our visit. There is a small car park, don\u2019t reverse too far back or you will fall into a ditch as one German couple did! The beach is about 100",
          "We visited the coral beach today and enjoyed a lovely walk along the coastline. It was a particularly windy day, so wrap up as there\u2019s not much shelter! The beach itself to walk along is beautiful! This is also a very easy walk, with an option to climb up a steep hill at the end",
          "A stunning coral beach amidst the rocky Skye coastline. A short, brisk walk along the coast to see this gem of a beach. Well worth the journey.",
          "The beach is very unusual in that it is made out of 'coral' (rather dead bits of seaweed that are hard and white, and shells). It is about a 15 minute walk from the car park, which was absolutely packed. We sat and watched seals popping up and down in the water, which was is",
          "Limited place in car park but worth the walk to the beach. An easy walk and a good track. Saw seals, sheep and cows and the odd jellyfish on the beach. More beach when the tide is out - lovely to see and a great view.",
          "We knew parking could be an issue after reading other reviews so we ventured up the single track road early in the day (10am). We did not have difficulty finding a place to park, but the tight car park area was jammed when we returned from the walk a few hours later. The walk",
          "After a short 15 minute walk from the end of the road we arrived at the beach mid afternoon. The beach itself was much smaller than we expected but the views were still pleasant. Worth a visit if in the area but not worth travelling a great distance to and its probably best to",
          "The hike to reach this beach is worth the walk. We ventured through a herd of cattle to reach the beach, and we walked with the cattle while leaving. The coral \"sand\" is amazing, and dipping your toes in the cool water is a must. Beautiful sight!",
          "Truly lovely to wander along these beautiful beaches but the approach is single track and there are very many people wanting to share the beauty so that the very limited parking becomes like a game of dodgems. So sad to see this. Local people are clearly tired of visitors using",
          "It was really amazing to see all those white shells in a bay surrounded by black rocks. We had light rain during our visit and it was a nice experience. It must be even more beautiful in the sun.",
          "Lovely little beach a few miles by Dunvagan Castle . Go early as parking is limited when busy then it\u2019s about 1 mile walk to beach , beautiful views from top of small hill at beach",
          "Gorgeous little beach that's a bit of a drive out, worth getting to early, then you park up and walk for about 15/20 mins. The track walk is pretty suitable for those with families or those who might find more challenging walks along some of the island's bigger view points",
          "We weren\u2019t blessed with great weather which was a shame, but it\u2019s still an enjoyable stroll down to this sandy beach. It doesn\u2019t compete with the best of Cornwall or further afield, but it\u2019s a lovely contrast to other parts of the island, the water is beautifully clear and the",
          "Come here if you like a walk in beautiful surroundings where the children can run for themselves without you being worried about them falling off a cliff. It\u2019s about two miles going back and forth, and the best part is the view from the end of the cliff. Parking is quite",
          "The parking is limited, so would recommend getting there early. The walk takes about 15-20 mins. The beach is not coral but coralline seaweed, which gives the beach its white colour. It is a wonderful place to relax with great views from the hill above the beach. Glorious!",
          "Firstly, this is quite a small stretch of beach. Plus, it's a very long walk from the small car park. The reason it didn't get a fifth star. However, if you want an absolutely stunning view across Dunvegan's sea Loch and a beach that is hard to beat, then this could be for you.",
          "Long walk to the beach but worth it when you get there. Not massively long beach but white sand and turquoise water especially when sun is out. Worth a visit.",
          "There is a lovely walk from the car park taking the path parallel to the sea until you reach the coral beaches. You get great views of Macleod\u2018s tables across Loch Dunvegan. The walk takes a good 20 mins + to get to the first coral beach, and beyond the second is a little hill",
          "We had beautiful weather for our trip to the beach and we got pretty badly sunburnt. Don\u2019t let the gentle Scottish breeze trick you! We got lucky with parking and found a spot but when we were leaving things were far more packed meaning we had to just reverse out rather than",
          "Lucky to find a parking space here so it's probably best to head there early. Nice stroll along with visitors and locals. A wedding party was dropped off by boat while we watched. Also enjoyed seeing the cows on the beach.",
          "Get there early! There is just one car park and its down a single track road so we experienced the usual camper vans blocking the road and it was tricky to get parked. We got parked okay (just) but others didn't and were turning around and leaving. My tip would be to get",
          "The beach is about a mile from the car park but it\u2019s a gentle walk to the shore line. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a lead as the path is through fields with livestock in. The beach is white made up from coral particles and the sea is blue. We spent a couple of hours",
          "What a super place! You have to park 1/2 hour walk away from the beach so not for the faint hearted. But do go! It;s such a lovely peaceful; place if you visit early or late and the seals will entertain you for as long as you want!",
          "Around a 20 minute walk to the beach. We went one evening and sat out till 11pm. We watched the cows graze and then go into the sea paddling around 10pm, we also saw seals too. The second night we decided to camp on the grass and that was an amazing experience. Lots of midges on",
          "The road to get to the beach seems at first a bit challenging. You have to park your car in the lot which may be filled during peak times, but it is free. Be prepared to walk for close to 30 Minutes in order to get to the beach. You will walk past a stone wall and some cows who",
          "Parking was a joke but once we squeezed our rental car into a tight space, it was easy going on the trail to the beach. It was dry that day, and had been for a few days prior, so the walk wasn't muddy, which was great. Once we made it over the hill, and saw the beach and the",
          "Skye has a lot of beaches, but most are rocky and stoney. We were looking for a nice sandy one that our mad cockapoos could chase a ball on without cutting their paws. We did some research via Google and came up with coral beach. It\u2019s not the easiest place to get to - single",
          "Park in the car park and get yer boots on. There is some rough ground to go over to get to the beach and the way can be muddy. It would be a long way for anyone less able. There is also cattle to negotiate. The beach is pretty with stunning views. I did not see any dolphins the",
          "There is a very pleasant walk towards the beach (which is around 15-20 minutes). You can park your car nearby and then you need to go to the beach by feet. There are magnificent views on the way there - azure sea with many small islands within, plenty of yellow flowers on the",
          "OK it's obviously not a Bondi Beach but as can be see from the mainly rocky beaches in the context of the Isle a sandy beach is a rarity. Also it reveals almost unbelievably that like Ireland, Scotland was also once in tropical waters. One other thing we loved about the",
          "A lovely spot but terribly windy and a bit of a walk from the car park. It's definitely not a 'proper' walk, and you may have to jump some rivers but it is very gorgeous and worth it for the views. One thing I will say is WATCH THE TIDE if you walk out to the island in front of",
          "The sun came out as we arrived at the beach on a Monday evening and made the coral even whiter. We enjoyed the 30 minute walk to the beach from the car park through fields of sheep. The water was clear and inviting although too cold to paddle. We could see the opposite headland",
          "It was a really wet day when we visited which probably impacted the views. We weren't very impressed when we got there to be honest - just looked like a normal shingle beach - until we sat down. Then we realised that the shingle wasn't small pieces of rock but actually tiny",
          "A lovely walk to a beach which looks just like abroad in the sun! The views from the hill beside it are spectacular. Worth a visit.",
          "Managed to get into the car park, no mean feat as this is a busy place especially Easter weekend. A wee mile walk to the coral beach, well worth a visit if only to see more of the stunning scenery in this area, feeling the coral between your fingers is both superb and",
          "In the summer this place is idyllic, at the beginning of spring, with the tail end of the Beast from the East,. . . . well it\u2019s a completely different place altogether . . Bundled up in our thermals it still looks very nice. OK it had stopped raining and the sun was out ( in",
          "When other reviews say this beach is like a Caribbean Beach they do not lie as we have travelled all over the Caribbean and this is definitely on a par. The main difference is the attire you need when on the beach, not a swim suit day when we visited but beautiful all the same.",
          "It was a lovely place to visit - a lovely walk to reach it. Signs everywhere to keep your dogs on a lead, which I did not by everybody which is a shame. The colour of the sea is unforgettable. I went again very early before anybody else was there and it was absolutely magic",
          "More stunning scenery, on the day we visited it was glorious sunshine and you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Caribbean. The coral that makes up the beach is graded by the sea from large pieces at one end of the beach to very small sand like particles at the other",
          "Beatiful beach, freezing water! But what thrill to put our feet in the crystal clear water of the Atlantic ocean!",
          "From parking up there is a lovely walk to the white coral beach. The sea is clear with lots of wildlife to see. This is definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Skye.",
          "This was our second stop of the day after Neist Point and we're very happy we made the effort. The stroll to the end of the beach is practically flat and the views are stunning. There were lots of cars in the parking area, but the area did not feel crowded. It's a very",
          "This is a beautiful stretch of beach hidden in the north-western corner of Skye by the village of Claigan. Depsite the name, it\u2019s not really coral but hardened bleached algae though a variety of colourful shells are noticeable on the beach. From the carpark, you open a gate and",
          "It was windy and bracing but wouldn't have missed the walk to the Coral Beach. So unexpectedly beautiful in this wonderful, rugged landscape and we spent an hour just looking up at the view and down at the endlessly fascinating shells on the beach. Geoff and Hilary I",
          "Amazingly beautiful and peaceful beach, one of the most beautiful I have ever been. We were lucky to be there on a sunny day, so walking there from the carpark (which is very small!) was enjoyable and the path easy to walk (can be muddy when wet). White beach and beautiful",
          "Lovely walk to the beach and would be stunning if you get a sunny day - we got soaked to the skin as it was blowing a gale and pouring so not recommended in this type of weather unless you have the right attire. Beware about the car parking as it is extremely limited",
          "You have to walk about a mile from the car park to get to the beaches, but this helps to preserve the quiet, remote nature of the place. I visited very early in the morning, so there was no one else around - I suspect that t can be very busy at other times.",
          "I'd seen the reviews on tripadvisor so decided to visit after going to Dunvegan Castle. You just keep driving after the castle until you get to a car park. The road between the castle and the car park is single track but it's only for a few miles. The car park isn't that big",
          "Good 30 minute trek each way along sometimes muddy path but worth it for the views, can be difficult to get parked.",
          "We got here around lunch time to find the car park quite busy but a few spaces left. After a walk of about a mile you arrive at the beach. When we got there it was very quiet with only another 5 or 6 people. The water was crystal clean and the beach is something else. The beach",
          "An absolute gem of a place . It's about 2 miles past Dunvegan castle and there is a small car park . Be warned it gets very busy and you may struggle to find a space . It's about a 30 min walk from the car park , through the sunbathing cows ! Honestly never thought i would see",
          "This was a lovely place to visit an easy walk out to a beautiuful beach with fantastic views....we had a lovely afternoon here",
          "From a small car park it is a short walk to this 'coral' beach with great views towards the Waternish peninsula and a number of small islands. From the beach we spent some time watching the seals in the water as well as the fishermen offshore checking their lobster pots. I would",
          "Would have loved to visit but after travelling down the single track for a few miles came to the end of the road to discover no parking. Cars and camper vans lined the only available space at the side of the track. We had difficulty turning round but reluctantly left without",
          "Un-spoilt, beautiful beach on the north coast of Skye. Great for families and kids, too. Added benefit is watching the people walking out to the small island just off the coast and betting on whether they manage to remember walking back before the tide comes in :-)",
          "Enjoyable walk out to the beach from the car park , but the beach is limited in size and not that dramatic considering the other sites on the island. Worth a visit though!",
          "Easy walk from the car park (approximately 30min). Nice beach with great views. Bring your own pick nick and have a great time!",
          "What a stunning sight this beach was as you come over the brow of the hill. The white shell beach is amazing. It's an easy walk from the car park to the beach and even if it was trickier it would have been worth the effort. Everyone should see this beach.",
          "One of the best short walks on the Isle Of Skye, on a good day it's quite amazing - maybe not up to Caribbean standards or Great Barrier Reef but then this is Scotland - so give a little leeway please. You won't be disappointed unless you nit pick! My only concern is the",
          "i honestly can't believe anybody would be disappointed in this place regardless of where they are from or beaches they had seen . It is one of the most beautiful un spoiled beaches i have ever been to . We went at the start of August and it wasn't that busy at all quite a big",
          "For Aussies/Kiwis, you'll probably be disappointing by this beach. It's a nice walk with pretty views but it's an average beach by antipodean standards. It is easy though to see why the Poms and Northern Europeans would get excited by it, as it would almost be possible to get in",
          "We took the walk in August (so high season). Parking was quite difficult, due to many visitors, including a few rental RVs (which had no way to park, and could only turn around with great difficulty). The walk is easy, with only small elevation differences, and has fantastic",
          "Around a mile from the car park (found at the end of the single track past dunvegan castle) to the beaches. Nice easy walk for the little ones to the secluded beaches full of shells. Car park is small and fills up quickly. No facilities nearby.",
          "Kids enjoyed the views and the rock pools where there were plenty of jellyfish. The views across the bay are good and the small hill gives a different perspective then the beach. The car park was busy but people coming and going all the time so a space quickly became available.",
          "Bit of a trip to get there (single-lane road with the occasional rude driver), but worth it. So unexpected to see this stretch of white coral beach and turquoise water this far north. It's a beautiful spot to spend a few hours.",
          "We were very lucky with the weather on the day we went ie. it wasn't raining! What a fantastic place. My children even enjoyed the walk but it was the flying attempts for them on the hill in front of the beach. Worth the walk and if possible go early as parking is limited and",
          "what a trip. we had 30 degrease, nice, sunny, lovely day a corals everywhere. don't fall for the first beach, get going on the path and it will open in front of you.",
          "It is long way to walk to see The coral Beach but it is worth it . On The walk to The Beach we saw cows",
          "This beach initially jumps out at you out of a typically rugged Scottish coastline. Gleaming white in the distance - you would immediately think it is white sand. But on closer examination it is fine coral!! A real jewel in a stunning and remote landscape. A must see in Skye.",
          "Really enjoyed walking Up there ! Sunday morning 7:30 - fitst once Up there - amazing !! Worth the walk Up !!",
          "The beach is a good 30 min walk from the small car park, but it is well worth the walk, seals were swimming only metres from the shore which adds to this memorable experience. The beach was spotless and I opted for a swim to cool off. I would visit this beach again on any return",
          "First morning in Skye and it was rainy and foggy. Once we got here though the rain stopped and it was just windy and cloudy. We walked to the first part where it opens up to a beach and decided to walk up the hill where there was a path going in between an opening in a stone",
          "This is a pleasant walk to a nice beach, especially on a sunny day. But it gets very crowded. On our second visit there were wild campers with tents still pitched in the early afternoon, and families playing ball games and preparing to barbecue. In our opinion there are also",
          "Beautiful spot. Need to get there early to find a parking space and remember to park considerately to maximise space for other users. Also strongly suggest visitors take their rubbish away with them to preserve the beauty of this place for other visitors.",
          "The walk and the beach was nice. Water on a sunny day was indeed caribbean blue. Excluding cattle there was no wildlife which was our main reason for visiting the place. So decent 4 points for the attraction itself. I am an experienced driver period. Still car parking there is a",
          "I took a trip out to the Beach early Evening as other reviews complained of it being busy. In hindsight most nice places by definition will be busy but the Early Evening was lovely. This is a place where the weather will improve the experience as it is apparently much better on",
          "Claimants Coral Beach was a little gem. The walk to get to it was extremely enjoyable with incredible view and it was very flat. We saw a lot of seals playing about in the water and the small coral beach was lovely. From the hill behind, you can get a lovely view of the",
          "Never seen such white coral sand before. This place offers an amazing view. Crowded and rubbish parking (could be worse), but hey it was awesome.",
          "It is worth going if you are already at Dunvegan Castle. The walk is pleasant enough, but when we went there were heaps of people walking along the wide track. The coastal views are nice but so are many other parts. The beach itself is outstanding for its colour of shells but is",
          "I hate to bash things but this was a big disappointment, the drive there is far from easy and stress free. Same applies for the parking. The walk is long and tedious and when you get there it's not all what it's cracked up to be. It's honestly not that great, spend your time on",
          "I've been in coral beach and I'm going to explain you a bit... the coral beach is maybe the name because I would call it the black and white beach... if you like the basalt rocks covered with algae in a white sand beach, I strongly recommend you to visit it... if you are looking",
          "We followed every website's direction to that so called idyllic beach but really why do people exaggerate so much? The colour of the waters at some (2, maybe 3) points may look somewhat turquoise but it is all depending on the light, the wind and most predominantly, the tide.",
          "If you are looking for a short picturesque walk this is ideal. It's about 1.3 miles each way and the beach is very pretty with little white shells and calcified remains of sea plankton. It is creamy white and the sea is very pale blue therefore a scenic spot. Lots of seals in",
          "We have been to the Coral Beach twice and I cannot wait to go back. My favorite thing is to lay on the beach and look at it up close. All the pieces of white coral give the beach such a tropical look. A short walk but worth it!",
          "First off, I hate to disappoint another reviewer, but it is NOT actual coral on this beach--it's fossilized and sun-bleached algae. So there's that. The issue with this beach is the parking, which was nightmarish when we were there. Cars jockeying back and forth on a",
          "Definitely worth a visit, I did not expect to find actual pieces of coral washed up on the beach. We had the beach to ourselves for most of our visit. Short walk down a path, steep in places but manageable.",
          "I'm not sure if it was the weather the day I visited or the low tide but I didn't think this was anything special. Definitely not one of the more prettier beaches. I wouldn't spend the time walking all the way down there for this beach when there are so many more things to see",
          "This is a bit of a walk from the car park (longer than I expected) through a meadow and then a farm with bulls (be careful it says on the sign) but at the end of it there is a beautiful harbor with a coral beach. The water is an aqua hue and beautiful to see. Worth the walk. It",
          "You have to walk a mile or so to the coral beach but it is very well worth doing so. Throughout the pleasant walk along a substantial track the views are great, and the beach itself truly remarkable - I never expected to find a coral beach so far North! While there we saw",
          "This is an easy walk along a farm track, from the car park. The Beach is stunning, with its white beach made of shells and coral, and the water such a turquoise blue colour that you would never believe it was Scotland, more like a tropical beach. Great for walks, picnics or",
          "Went here on recommendation and found it really lovely. It is not far from Dunvegan castle and has car parking. The walk is quite manageable for me as an old age pensioner and we saw many basking seals on the nearby island. Great place to take a picnic and just enjoy the",
          "There is about a mile walk to reach this beach from the carpark and the parking is very tight. Having said that, when you see the beach from the distance it looks like white sand. It is actually crushed coral when you get up close. There aren't many beaches on Skye but I would",
          "Nice walk from the car park along the coast until you finally get to the beach. It was very interesting to not have sand but be made up of crushed coral! Was fun for my toddler to potter around on, collecting shells in her bucket.",
          "This is a great beach to visit. There is a parking lot which had plenty of room in it when we went. There is a short walk to get to the beach. Part of the walk is up a short hill, in case you have mobility issues. Not a very large beach but very pretty. There are a lot of small",
          "We stopped by after visiting Dunvegan Castle. The beach is a 10 min drive and then a 15 walk along the coast. The beach is small but very clean and along another wonderful piece of Skye coastline. Not much else to do other than drink in the scenery and enjoy whatever rays of",
          "The Coral Beach isn't exactly Coral but it is unusual and on a sunny day out of season, it is well worth the walk. Keep dogs on leads until you are past the cows and I would recommend either decent boots or walking wellies so you can have a scramble and explore a bit. If the",
          "We walked out to the beach expecting something special. It is quite a nice walk. The beach itself, there is just one, was really quite disappointing. There are many far nicer beaches on the island. I wouldn't go out if my way to go here unless you are nearby.",
          "This is a nice walk at any time of the year which affords some lovely views out to the Outer Hebrides. Nice to see that there is a thriving colony of inquisitive seals too. Good to photograph the Northern lights and you can also see round to Stein. The one thing this beach is",
          "Well worth the short walk from the car park along the shore until you spot the beach. We were there on a sunny warm day which shows the beach at its best. It was possible to walk over to the small island as the tide was very low, but be aware the tide comes back in very quickly.",
          "We walked from the car park took about 20mins, easy walk. Beautiful white viral beach and also quite popular.",
          "A lovely walk down to Coral Beach. Turquoise sea with seals basking, beautiful white sand and wonderful peace. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely walk to a stunning beach with amazing views. Quite an easy walk. Pick a dry day though. Great for a picnic and watch the world go by.",
          "I'm walking towards a snow white beach on a sunny day in warm weather on the Isle of Skye. It doesn't get better for a city dweller than that. Worth every step.",
          "The beach has barely any coral and is kind of plain. It's over a mile to walk there through cow paddocks. If you are keen to drive on windy narrow roads at night then apparently the sunset is amazing. the best bit about the beach though is the drive there. Pull over in the",
          "Just a lovely spot. The sea looks like you are abroad its so clear around the white coral. Good views and just a really pleasant walk especially in May when the light is so wonderful and less likely for a midgey attack.",
          "Not much parking here, if you get parked it's a half hour walk along a reasonable path to the coral beaches. They are small and very pretty in the sunshine as they are very white. Dogs must be kept on a lead as there are sheep everywhere. Good for an hour or too, maybe longer if",
          "Car park easy to find as it's at the end of the road. Track to follow well laid out . If you have a dog be aware there are cows in the the vicinity. Quite a windy little track , but worthwhile doing . You will be glad you went. On the way to car park you should see quite a lot",
          "The walk from the car park has to be longer than is stated on the board but it is quite a nice walk and its fairly flat. We were rewarded with an impromptu seal show as a whole group of them frolicked in the wayer im front of us! The beach itself is beautiful.",
          "We parked in the designated car park, put on our walking boots and were on our way!. The walk is very pretty with views of the loch, the surrounding hills and mountains and the Outer Hebrides further out to sea. As we walked we watched seven or eight seals who just bobbed around",
          "There is free parking but the beach is very popular, so you may have trouble squeezing in. The beach is then half an hours walk away but well worth it. The backdrop is a small climbable hill.",
          "The drive to coral beach is down a single track road, with a somewhat undersized parking area at the entrance to the attraction. Which leads to another point, the entrance to the attraction is about a mile or so away from the beach, and with many attractions in Scotland you will",
          "Visited this beach after Dunvegan. Turquoise water; wonderful light; and white coral sand were amazing. Our dog enjoyed the walk and sea.",
          "The walk isn't particularly demanding and the reward substantial. Gorgeous beach and whilst it's not actual coral, it is nonetheless unusual and beautiful. Plenty of cows to greet you en route as well.",
          "A lovely sunny day made our visit to the beach totally relaxing. Seals were bobbing about and diving. It was a windy day but we were wrapped up and sat watching the seals for some time on this glorious little beach. Road to it is single track with some potholes in it but that's",
          "It's a okay beach, not so much exciting for me as I have visited lot of beaches. It was not so exciting, you can give it a miss if you can. Nothing much.",
          "This beach is really particular due to its \"corals\" (which are in fact dried pieces of algae, called \"maerl\", but nevertheless stunning). A short hike is necessary, though, and can be pretty muddy after rain. The road to Claigan is single track, with some potholes - but not",
          "Drove up to the little car park - be aware, it may be busy in summer - parked up and headed off on our walk. It is a pleasant stroll along a bit of the coast where you can keep an eye out for an array of wildlife from seabirds to whales, dolphins, seals and maybe eagles! The",
          "loved this little beach, such a surprise when you walk over the top of the hill and it's before you, fantastic views in all directions, and we saw a few seals on a nearby island. just lovely!",
          "It's like you are treated to a little bit of the Caribbean in the north west of Scotland as there is almost white sand and a green/blue sea but be warned : this is only a small area and you have to walk just over a mile (2 km?) from the car park to reach it !",
          "Suspect it would be nicer on a sunny day but I have to agree that it's not as spectacular as the hype. Took about 40 minutes from the car park to get out to the headland. Lovely views and location overall. Stopped off at the Lochside cafe on the way back near Dunvegan Castle for",
          "This beach is well worth the mile walk from the car park. The contrasts and colours is nature at it very best.",
          "I would give this place the skip next time. Other places in Skye offer a lot more. However, the drive leading upto this place is absolutely beautiful. The beach itself is very very disappointing. Average at best.",
          "Worth the walk , stunning place . Bit of a walk and check the tide times . Car park at the end of the road and then about 1.2 miles",
          "We were really lucky with the weather when we arrived and after the short 15 minute walk in the afternoon sun we upon the beach. The pictures really do not do this justice - and walking up onto the small hill at the end of beach gives an aspiring view of the area. On the drive",
          "Lovely walk from small car park down to gorgeous beach. Our lab Marley loved it and the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. Allow about hour and half there and back depending of course if you can drag yourself away.",
          "You pull into a small car about a 5 minute drive past Dunvegan Castle. From there you walk a well laid out path to a small coral beach, keep on walking over the hill between a large dry stone dyke. At the top of the hill you get the first view of the Coral Beach. It is",
          "A nice easy walk to the beach. I'll warn you, the beach is not huge, but it's nice and we went early on a February morning so it was pretty quiet. Hopefully you'll have it to yourselves too.",
          "Unfortunately it was a cold, wet and windy afternoon when we visited but it was on my 'to do' list and we had doubled up with a visit to Dunvegan Castle. A small car park (no facilities) and mixed terrain but a well trodden path so you won't get lost, it was worth a visit.",
          "Easily the highlight of our break. Lucky enough to go on a really sunny day and be (almost) alone there! The water was so crystal clear I had to have a paddle - in February! I love the way nothing has been done there to detract from The naturalness of the environment. Pure and",
          "We loved this place, takes an hour or so accross potentially boggy ground to get there, but make sure you do. Its one of the stranger sites i have seen which makes it a must see. Make sure to go right round as far as you can to get more great views, specially from the top of the",
          "2 attempts to make it to the Coral beach...1st day just too wet, the next time was a success although still a bit damp, definitely cold and very very windy. Well worth the effort. Although the beach is a little ordinary it still has its own uniqueness and beauty. It's raw and",
          "It took us an hour to walk to the beach, but it was flat, easy, and enjoyable. This area contrasts with the hills and heaths of the Isle and we were pleasantly surprised to discover such amazing beaches and ocean views on this rugged, rocky island!",
          "About a 45 min walk with varied terrain to a beautiful bay and clear turquoise sea. Well worth the effort - mind out for the boggy bits and the stepping stones! Lovely little tumbledown croft near the shore - made me wonder who had such a lovely view - I'm sure they must have",
          "Weather was good so decided to visit coral beach. Car park not very big and was quite full when we arrived which was mid to late afternoon. Took us about 45 minutes to walk but we stopped a few times to take in the scenery and of course take pictures. Beach is very unusual as it",
          "Tranquility, one with nature, it's all here, in the air, on the beach, and scurrying along the ground. One of the most serene places on earth",
          "We didn't arrive at the car park until around 2pm in late November on a bright sunny afternoon, no breeze at all. The rocky path to the beach was rocky, sloping and somewhat wet and even icy in places. Good sturdy waterproof shoes needed as parts of the walk is quite soft and",
          "Visited here during a trip in February. Picked up a couple of hitchhikers during our drive around the isle and mentioned that we were making the long drive down to this beach. It's a decent mile or so walk to the beach, and in suspect weather, it may be quite slippy underfoot.",
          "On a cold drizzley day we decided to go to find the coral beach. from the car park it is a mile walk through stunning scenary.If you have a dog you need to keep it on a lead due to livestock. The pathway is at times uneven and rugged wear walking boots or wellies as you do have",
          "Short walk from the car park, rough ground in parts if you're thinking about push chairs or wheelchairs. We walked trough a shower then when we got there a stunning winter sun came out. Spent a lovely couple of hours just exploring and enjoying the beautiful beach, views and",
          "What a great place! The walk from the car park is just over a mile, but it's worth it. In cooler, wetter weather, wellies/hiking boots are a must as the path gets quite muddy. We went on a particularly windy day, so we were in warm layers with gloves and hats. The drive to the",
          "We visited off season and went early in the morning which was really nice....though we didn't have to ourselves for veyr long. Worth a visit.",
          "Lovely walk beautiful beach great for the dog but just be wary of any livestock about. Low water you can walk across to the island.",
          "What a beautiful beach it is. It looks like the one from Scottish calendars, that you think it's not real or must have been Photoshoped but this beach is for real! Go to the hill beside it, and you would get even a better view!",
          "You do not believe you can get a beach like that in Scotland.You think to be in Cuba.There is a little parking place.Leave the car there and walk for an half of an hour.The path is simple and nearly flat.Before getting the beach you climb a little and then get the beach , really",
          "A beautiful location that can be enjoyed by visitors of all ages. Busier than expected even out of season, but this is all relative - you can still find a quiet spot as everyone spreads out. The car park was busy late afternoon, and the walk to the beach seems longer than the 1",
          "After a day of cruzin around we pulled up here and went for a nice stroll. Its a nice spot to eat lunch or drink a bottle of wine. Enjoyed the drive and the views",
          "Lovely walk across moorland to the beach. You can see the pieces of coral quite clearly when you get there. There is a small hill behind the beach which is worth climbing for stunning views of the area.",
          "Just stunning...there isn't much I can put into words that will do this beach any justice so will only say a must visit if you are in this area.",
          "Came with rabbies tour and the guide said this was supposed to be a hidden gem but after looking it up it's all over TripAdvisor already! Along the little path for 10 minutes or so you will reach the beach area and behind that there is a white sand dune. Beautiful area and",
          "A relatively easy walk (with muddy parts and a few small streams to cross after rain) is well worth it, the beach is gorgeous and affords plenty safe space for youngsters to run around. Small hillock at beach for those with adventurous 7 year olds to scramble up and down - well",
          "Nice walk by the sea, not too far, pretty beach and tiny wee hill at the end to see the views. Skye is a really amazing place and this is well worth a visit if your up there! I loved this one, go it's a great place to be on a sunny day.",
          "A lovely beach, with a moderate walk to reach it. Well worth the effort, and great for all the family. Combine with a trip to Dunvegan Castle.",
          "I visited on a Monday morning in October so I was a little surprised at how busy this place was. The car park was busy when I arrived, and full when I left a few hours later, and I was never out of sight of another group. The reason for this being so popular was apparent when",
          "Nice little walk to the beach. We went early in the morning to enjoy it by ourselves because it is only a little beach....... but very popular!",
          "We walked from Dunvegan to the Coral Beach as we wanted a long walk that day but there is a car park at Claigan for those that want a short walk to the beach. This was a beautiful spot and is well worth the visit.",
          "A few miles outside Dunvegan this little beach is well worth the walk from the car park. Not a difficult walk at all and we were lucky to be there on a beautiful day where the water was both crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight. Take a walk up the wee hill for a great",
          "After squeezing the car into the tight carpark we headed off towards the beach down a very rugged path. At first sight we wondered what the fuss was all about. Large black rocks greeted us for the first part of the way. After cresting a slight rise we got our first sight of our",
          "The beach is about 3 miles past Dunvegan Castle. The car park is situated probably about a mile and a half from the beach. Don't be fooled by the first sight of a beach you get... Keep walking until you finally see the white sands! The walk is not too difficult - we took our 5",
          "The first part of the pathway is pretty easy going - could do it in trainers. Down onto the first beach is no problem. But if you're looking to do the bigger beach you'll need proper walking shoes as evidenced by the daft foreigner types who are completely unprepared in flip",
          "a short, easy coastal walk brings you to this lovely place. the walk can be extended if you like. i was lucky enough to get there early and have the beach to myself.",
          "Did this walk from the car park early one morning in very high winds and horizontal rain. The path was pretty muddy in places and there were a few small burns to cross. On arrival at the beach I was a bit disappointed but this was more down to the weather than anything else.",
          "The beach was so pretty, the little pieces of coral were interesting to see--and so many interesting shells. The cows along the hike were so funny, and baby cows too!",
          "A long walk to a rather disappointing beach for me. Not the best weather when we were there in fairness but I was underwhelmed. Views from the peninsula were good albeit a bit wild. May have been spoiled by the lack of sun/brightness but beach is a mix of sand and coral.",
          "We did this walk on a warm day after many days of rain. The path becomes quite tricky in places. We passed walkers who weren't properly equipped and they were finding it hard going. There are streams to cross and with extra mud you need to find a way across. I would say walking",
          "We had both during our visit and a lot of wind. Be sure to wear sturdy footwear. It's a good 20 minute walk to the beach and the views are spectacular. I guess it will me easier to enjoy on a clear sunny day. Beautiful beach, clear water and a good walk.",
          "A beautiful place near from dunvengan's castle. You have to visit for take some photos! It's free and car park it's free too! When you parks your car you have to walk about 10 minutes until you see the beach.",
          "We had wet and windy weather most of the time we spent in Skye. After too much driving, during a lull in the rain and wind we walked the easy mile to \"coral\" beach. A beautiful walk. The \"coral\" is actually dried, calcified sea weed which we found interesting. Wear shoes that",
          "We always wanted to see what the fuss was about at this beach ... I looked it up and the pictures seemed amazing. Get to the car park. Which when we went it wasn't busy so plenty of space. Go through the gate ... better wearing wellies or something along those lines as the",

          "Park up if you can get a space it's very busy, walk along the tract through the gate and then there's the cows, if you're not bothered by them carry on over the fields which after rain are extremely boggy,then you come upon the coral beach it's like something out of the",
          "We'd visited Dunvegan Castle so it seemed a shame not to drive the extra 3 miles to Claigan. The car park is fairly small made much smaller by some pretty chaotic parking. The walk to the beach is a fairly easy 30 minutes each way. After heavy rain sections of the path were",
          "This is highly recommended place - it not worth to go so far. The parking is full, the way is easy but long and not interesting. The beach... well, possibly for north country it is exotic, but not worth spend day on Skye for it. The seals by the way to Claigan - are more",

          "Short walk (c. 20 mins) from carpark to an interesting beach and beautiful clear sea. Good for a short visit on a sunny day.",
          "This is beautiful but there are no facilities which we realised but others didn't. This meant random toilet stops and dreadful parking making it difficult for others.",
          "Lovely beach with a great view. The water is crystal clear and the 'sand' white. Don't be deceived though. The sand is much more interesting than usual. Have a closer look! The walk to the beach is interesting especially when you have a mother cow watching your every move near",
          "It was a n half an hour walk from the parking to the Coral beach. But not worth it. Many yellow seaweed and a little stroke of white beach? We looked any further around the corner if the beach was there. But this was the only one.",
          "This was the easiest walk that we did in Skye. Spotted seals in the waters off the beach. Great views from the hill overlooking the beach",
          "Beautiful spot found after a walk along the coast and over a grass hill. Small parking area at the end of a single track road. Selfish camper van drivers seemed intent on blocking the roads and parking across several parking spaces. Stay away if you are driving a camper van.",
          "This one is nice but doesn't make it to my favorite sites in Skye. The walk there is very long, so my advice is reconsider if you're on a tight schedule. I don't quite understand what they mean by \"coral\"; I didn't exactly see any. But it's a beautiful beach and the cows nearby",
          "Love this place...have visited many times even with small children. Limited parking especially on a nice day but the walk is relatively flat and easy. Views are lovely. Good for a picnic. You need decent shoes.",
          "Don't be scared by the sign advising 45 minute walk there and 45 minute walk back. We did the whole thing in about 45 minutes. The coral beach is nice, but a lot of the beach had heavy sea weed on it. You could see nice clear beach, but you had to walk along a lot of not so",
          "The beach is a short and scenic drive past Dunvegan Castle on a typical single track road where seals can be easily viewed on the rocky shores to your left. There is a short walk of about a mile from the car park that can get a little boggy at times but when the beach opens up",
          "This is a fabulous place it is peaceful, tranquil and just beautiful. A place where you can sit and think, enjoy beautiful views. It is about a mile to walk to the beach and to get there you have to climb of a small incline of cliff and past the grazing cattle. Yes, it does",
          "The beach is a good 15-20 minute walk from the car park (if you can get parked!) but is worth it. Would I drive the 90 minutes from our accommodation to go again - no. Bear in mind the nearest facilities of any sort are back at Dunvegan Castle. It is a beautiful beach although",
          "The beach is a very long walk from the parking, and during that walk, it appeared like this beach might be a disappointment, but the sight of seals at the beach completely overshadowed everything! I was shrieking in delight when I saw the seals, and it was absolutely lovely.",
          "The coral beach is a small beach with white \"sand\" and pretty turquoise waters near the shore. Seals bob in the sea nearby. Whether the beach is worth the relatively long and windy drive to get there and the half-hour-plus walk in will largely depend on whether you have been",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a drive on the single track winding road. Limited parking on a nice day. And the walk I think was about ~2 miles to actually get out to coral beach. You walk through cattle pastures, mind the cows with calves! There are bunnies along the walk. It is steep in some",
          "Easy walk to the beach but we were there after some rain & it was very muddy. From Dunvegan Castle, continue towards Claigan for about 3 miles on the A850",
          "Not far from Dunvegan, Coral Beach is well worth a walk to. Lovely clear waters with seals playing just off the shore and some stunning scenery as well. There are opportunities to see other wildlife too. The beach stands out from the rest of the shoreline and information boards",
          "Just north of Dunvegan castle, it takes about a half hour to walk the path to the beach.There are no man-made structures along the way, so it's a very pleasant walk. Once there, my husband and I saw many rabbits pop up out of their burrows next to the coral beach. We also saw",
          "The \"sand\" is made up of teeny tiny pieces of ocean smoothed shells or coral. You'd need to be much braver than me to go swimming, but theoretically it's possible. The dunes behind the beach are home to bunnies! This would be a fun place to bring kids... lots of shells and",
          "I had the Coral Beach on my list of places to visit on Skye, but was a bit disappointed when I got there. It was a cloudy day, so the sand was not very vibrant, and the beach was much smaller than I thought it would be. It was still a very pleasant walk. (Make sure you follow",
          "It was about a 30 minute walk to get the the beach but well worth it. A beautiful coral beach set amongst the back drop of Scottish Mountains. We went late summer evening and were the last on the beach. We saw Seals playing along the shore line which was a real treat,",
          "It's a very pleasant short walk to the beach along a footpath following the shore. If you're lucky seals can be spotted along the way and the views at the end are beautiful. The small car park is reached at the end of the road a short drive beyond Dunvegan Castle.",
          "After spending a few hours at Luskentyre beach on Harris, which was incredibly beautiful, we didn't feel the need to go out of our way to visit more beaches. But this beach was on my list of things to see, and was near enough to our hotel in Glendale, so I thought it would have",
          "The views were outstanding which were helped by the seals playing just off shore. Nice easy walk with a great result",
          "While parking can be a bit of a problem during 'peak hours', it's worth sparing a couple of hours for this walk to burn off some calories. And if you are lucky and keep a bit of distance from the coast together with other fellow visitors, you might be able to see some sea lions.",
          "It's about a mile walk from where you park the car to the beach, but it was a nice walk. When you reach the beach it's truly beautiful. Crystal clear waters. White coral beach. It's like paradise. Myself and my 6yrs old daughter looked through the coral sand at all the detail",
          "We picked a warm and sunny day to visit this beach, and the 20 minute walk was definately worth while. It was almost like being on the Barrier Reef!",
          "It's a bit of a walk though fields (probably too far for young children) to this beautiful beach but it was definitely worth it. We were lucky that it was very sunny and it looked like a Caribbean beach!",
          "Since I'm from California I wasn't that excited at first glance, but once I saw the clear water and realized that the beach wasn't sand but in fact tiny coral and shells, I was really amazed. It was beautiful. We spent a couple of hours all together (walking and enjoying) and it",
          "Rather a let down really--went in the evening --quite busy --but not worth the visit--maybe we are spoilt in the North East of England--but hardly worth any comment--nice stroll there and back",
          "I would recommend a visit to Coral beach. It's a lovely relatively gentle walk through the fields to the beach and the coral is stunning. Best to visit on a bright sunny day as the water and coral just sparkle!",
          "We were told we just had to go here by people from Edinburgh. This might be an unusual and magical beach for folks who live where there aren't many of them, but for us, visitors from the east coast of the US who've visited many beaches in North America, this was pretty",
          "We skip Dunvegan castle, and headed to Coral Beach. The weather was not perfect, cloudy, light rain, but the atmosphere were magic. The girls loved that. Sand is not fine, but clear and water is literally transparent. We planned to spend one hour and ended up to stay more than 3",
          "A little tough to find (you have to go past Dunvegan Castle), but worth the trip. Car park is a little small, but fortunately for us was a good day to visit...only about a dozen other cars. I think it's closer to a 2 mile hike to get to the crescent beach, but it's a fairly easy",
          "Continue on A850 road which passes Dunvegan castle towards Claigan and you will pick up signs to the Coral Beach, the road narrows to a single track with passing places. Car parking is free, but the spaces do get taken very quickly so it might be an idea to arrive early. The",
          "This is a beautiful beach and only really a short and fairly easy walk from the parking spot. Fantastic clear water and a coral like sand(actually algae!) on a sunny day it could be somewhere tropical! If you are thinking it will be deserted, think again! Can get very busy and",
          "It is worth the walk to see this 'white' beach. managed to spot a seal which was a bonus for me. Free car park",
          "The car park is quite a far walk from the small stretch of beach. A nice walk though, on a sunny day. The views out onto the water are stunning.",
          "Visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon in early June. It was difficult to get parked but turnover of cars in the car park happens regularly. The walk to the beach was nice with seals swimming out in the bay. The water is very clear and my wife took a paddle. Climbed the small hill",
          "The walk down and back from the coral beach is relaxing and enjoyable, provided you have no difficulty with going up and down hills and don't mind hopping over small streams across stones. I'd recommend wearing proper walking shoes, and sun screen if you go on a sunny day like",
          "Having read some tripadvisor reviews we thought this might be a trek through tricky paths and streams, so we wore wellies and walking boots. But it was really a very easy, gentle stroll and having had dry weather the streams to cross were just trickles with easy stepping",
          "A must visit when visiting Skye! Spectacular scenery indeed. Ensure you have suitable footwear for walking as paths are rough and can be slippy especially when descending the hills if you have climbed them to get to advantage points!",
          "A lovely walk leads eventually to this beautiful beach which is an ideal place for a picnic or a paddle",
          "Islands, green pastures, blue and turquoise seas, coral sand beach, flowers, forever views...all make this a pretty walk. Nice days are, well, nicer, as the color pops.",
          "After braving the nightmarish car park on a hot sunny day (there isn't nearly enough parking, so lots of cars reversing out and trying to find somewhere to park...), it's about a 20 minute walk to the coral beach along an easy path. The beach is simply stunning, I spent some",
          "Not a deserted beach at may half term, but still stunning. Parking a bit limited, 20 minute easy walk. Would like to have had a wet suit to swim. Lovely place for a picnic",
          "A short easy walk of about 30 minutes each way and sea views with changing light and atmosphere. You don't see the beach until walking up a small hill, hidden from view you suddenly get your first glimpse of the beach at the crest of the hill and wow what a sight, the white",
          "What a hidden treasure this place is. Lovely walk and stunning views over the sea. Great place to see seals. Very relaxing. Love Coral Beach. Well worth a visit",
          "Well worth the short walk. The area is very clean and the water crystal clear. A gem of a location. Worth walking up to the point as Common Seals can be clearly seen on the small island opposite the beach.",
          "The hike to the beach is a bit long but the walk is easy. The beach can get busy so be prepared. We had a beautiful day with not a cloud in the sky. The water was extremely cold being from the states we are used to much warmer water. The beach is shells so they are not easy on",
          "Lovely walk, about 2 miles from the car park. Fairly deserted when we went. The beach is made up of coral and not sand. Lots of bird life and seals.",
          "Walked here twice over the two weeks we were on Skye, the first in gale force winds and rain and the second on a beautiful sunny day! It is well worth the walk and for a picnic when the weather allows! Look out for the seals basking in rocks on the little island opposite.",
          "A bery beautiful beach, crystal clear water and a nice walk with great views. But very very busy, lots of people there so not really a place to enjoy some peace and quiet.",
          "Park the car in the car park and take a short hike of about 40minutes each way to this amazing place. You take the first glimpse of it as you walk over a nearby hill. It takes your breath away as it is not what you would expect of a beach on the Isle of Skye. This was one of the",
          "We were advised by locals to visit this beach and we were so glad we did. The route is quite tough in parts, over ditches and through mud, so walking boots are needed. However, when you get your first glimpse of the coral beach you will be \"wowed\". It was also a bit windy when",
          "Not much car parking at the end of the track that leads to the two mile walk to the beach. A bit of a rough track to get to the coral beach but well worth the effort; stunning views and a coral beach at the end.",
          "Was a loverly walk out to the Coral Beach although a little windy it was nice to see and well worth visiting",
          "An exhilarating walk to a beautifil beach. Not easy terrain for buggies though. Well worth the walk.",
          "A Scottish beach at its best. The day we visited we were the only people there. If it is a good day go and watch the sun set. Utterly beautiful.",
          "Tranquil and beautiful place... You won't believe that you're still in Scotland!! (Until the breeze gives it away!)",
          "We were staying on Skye for our honeymoon and got told about a nice wee walk near Dunvegan which would take us to a coral beach - we thought it sounded like a good way to spend an afternoon..This ended up being the best day out we had on our 7 day break, the beach was stunning",
          "We travelled here on a very cold but sunny day and it was most bizarre looking at a beach that looks as though it belongs in the Caribbean?! I would most definitely visit here again on a warmer day.",
          "Short walk to a fantastic beach worth a visit especially on a sunny day. Saw some seals. Take a picnic and linger",
          "It s a realy confortable walk. In the end we even saw seals! They came very close to the beach..that was nice.. It was a little bit rainy so good shoes are really nescessary for this walk, but even in rain very nice...",
          "Well worth the walk. The pathway needs looking at though. It stops half way to the beach. After that it's a muddy quagmire. Parking is very restrictive. Perhaps a farmer could allow use of a small park. Best tip arrive early for parking",
          "The walk could be a little better as the pathway is boggy in places. The beach looks amazing when u finally get a glimpse after creasting a nearby hill. The water looks inviting. It certainly gives the legs a stretch off if you have been in the car a while.",
          "This is the third time I've been to coral beach so I'm undoubtably part of the problem... the beach is lovely though a million people walking every year has taken its toll on the landscape and the paths have eroded quite a bit which makes me a bit sad. I've been in the depths",
          "We almost skipped the Claigan Coral Beach on our road trip through Skye, as it's kind of a pain to get to. But we were SO glad that we went. It helped that we had a beautiful warm, clear March day! The views were stunning, and it was such a lovely walk down to the beach. Highly",
          "we did this walk at the end of the day, so we were slightly pushed for time .... i am not sure this really qualifies as a short walk - i estimate it took us a good hour to get to the beach while we ambled along. the path splits about 3/4 of the way - take the left path. lovely",
          "It's a bit of a trek from the car park. But boy is it worth it. Through the cattle gates, over the fields and pass the cows. Then over another hill. Take your walking shoes with you and make sure their waterproof. It's soooooo worth it. What a beautiful beach it is. If it was",
          "I would recommend visiting coral beach for anyone looking for a short, easy, peaceful walk. The beach at the end is spectacular both at low and high tide and can be appreciated in any weather. It is also a good location for a nice sunset.",
          "About 20 degrees from Paradise. Shortish walk to a peninsula but so worth it. Only the chill breeze reminding you that you are actually in the Hebrides. Beach is beautiful, as are the views, worth adding a bit of time to wander around and explore. Also if tide is out go",
          "I was very impressed with this spot of beach. It's not very big but it's chocked full of tiny pieces of coral and shells. Great for a bit of walking. Would not recommend heading back through the bog heath and bracken unless you want to explore the croft ruins.",
          "Coral Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach with clear turquoise water and amazing scenery surrounding the location. It's about a mile walk from the car park which can be quite muddy so wear suitable footwear. It's an easy walk though with only gentle slopes and tiny burns to",
          "Unfortunately, we went on a windy day but it was still quite sunny so we made the trek to the quite remote coral beach. It is a good hike to get there but the kids (2 yr and 6 yr) managed it fine and it is quite easy to walk. We took lunch and drinks and had it on the beach. I",
          "Water is crystal clear here, and the views are stunning. We went at sunset which made it all the more beautiful.",
          "It's a meandering walk to the beach but worth it. Bluey green seas surrounded by beach and diverse coastal life. Look out for the otters watching from the water!",
          "Another get there early recommendation...you will have the place to yourself hopefully, as we did. Lovely un-taking walk, beach is lovely, water so clear. Spotted some seals frolicking...just lovely.",
          "Beautiful place, best on a good day for full results. About a mile walk to the site, it's a nice walk too.",
          "a two mile easy walk leads you to a small sandy beach with small but steep hills to climb to enjoy the scenery further. We could see seals playing in the kelp. A beautiful place to relax or picnic!",
          "This is just another piece of paradise in a huge jigsaw puzzle of beaches. Every one slightly different to the last one.",
          "This really is an amazing little beach with some incredible views. It's a nice walk, especially when you can catch a bit of sun, but it does get muddy and slippery at parts if it's been raining. I could have stayed here for much longer than we did just taking it all in!",
          "Stunning beach. It's and interesting walk from the carpark as it isn't signposted on the way but if you keep walking along to the first beach (with grey stones) until you see an opening in the dry stone dyke (wall), go through it and over the brow of the hill and you will see",
          "So after seeing the pictures of the beach online it was a must see and we weren't disappointed. Walk 1km to a rocky beach camas then walk towards the gap in the old wall over the hill is the sandy coral beach.",
          "Lovely place to walk....better when the tide is out, as you have access to another part. A perfect place to walk the dog, have a picnic and just enjoy.",
          "This is a short walk for a leg-rest day along a beach, low rises and views across the loch and ocean. Very pleasant.",
          "This is a very nice walk and at the end of it you arrive at an extremely beautiful white sand beach. There are many and varied walks on Skye and this one although not long and taxing is certainly well worth doing.",
          "Great beach to take dogs for a walk. Quite a few people there (car park vey busy) but it still seemed remote. Lovely location well worth a visit.",
          "We're very lucky to have a glorious sunny October day to take the walk out to the coral beach. It's about a mile from the car park and you'll need decent footwear. The beach itself was stunning and the vies were amazing.",
          "Just a short walk from the car park to a small photogenic beach. We were lucky enough to see seals basking at its furthest point. I would recommend visiting early as it's very popular and parking is limited.",
          "The real adventure at this beach is probably the drive to the car park area! Seriously though, this is a great little walk over rutted tracks and some sheep trails to a quite beautiful curved beach rich in white coral. There are many good vantage points for photos. In the late",
          "This is not a very long or difficult walk, but is well worth the treacherous drive to the walk entrance. After a short distance you ll find some local cows that enjoy sleeping on the gorgeous sand. Definitely worth checking out!",
          "You need to go out your way to find this,but it is so worth it! A bit of a rough track to walk along,but the scenery does not disappoint.So worth it when you come over the brake,even on a dull day.The water is turquoise and the sand illuminates even on a rainy day. Will",
          "We were at Dunvegan Castle and the lady working there told us the beach was just a couple miles (4) down the road. So we drove down there - the road was narrow and only allowed for 1 car at a time and took a while. Once we got there the sign at the parking lot said (i believe)",
          "This is a lovely site but only one beach was as advertised, the other was covered in stones & sea-weed, which I know can't be helped, but didn't quite have the Wow factor I was expecting. It was a lovely day though, with a very low tide following the blood moon event, so several",
          "Easy walk fairly flat for some one unfit like me. Unusual nature of the beach worth exploring. Watch out for the tide coming in as some others got caught out by the little island created.",
          "To get there , go straight past Dunvegan castle , and your now on the one track road , follow this for a good ten minutes and you come to a dead end , now the walk begins , its a good few miles , but worth it , on your way you will see gannets and other sea birds , as you climb",
          "A lovely little walk with spectacular scenery. We were lucky when we visited that the tide was low so we were able to walk across to a little island. The Coral beach is beautiful and white. Alt hour this isn't true coral, but in fact the remains of seaweed",
          "The beach is beautiful and offers a nice view of the surrounding loch. It's a total change of scenery compared to the usual cliffs on Isle of Skye.",
          "We visited Coral Beach on a dry day and although it had been raining heavily the previous day the approach lane was not all sludgy as we expected. There's a free car parking area with limited spaces. It's about a two mile walk on an uneven dirt track to the beach. When we were",
          "Who would have believed you would see a coral beach on Skye! A two mile walk from the car park at the end of the road several miles past the entrance to Dunvegan castle is worth every step. The amazing colours of the water and the coral make it seem as if you are in the",
          "We were lucky enough to visit the beach on a wonderful sunny day. The views were out of this world! The beach is crystal clear blue! There were some daredevils brave enough who actually took a swim in the water...but not for the weak of heart!",
          "Lovely place - pure water, clean beach, fabulous views around - takes about 10 minutes nice walk from the car park",
          "This used to be a very much unknown part of the island but it's now on the standard tourist \"circuit\". If you want solitude, best plan to get here early or very late. It's a very pretty wee spot though and you can spend hours checking out the wee \"coral\" pieces on the beach,",
          "We did the drive and then hike along the coast to see the coral beaches, but unfortunately got caught in a passing shower and were drenched to the skin, even though we had come with waterproof coats! Even so, the beach is very impressive, if a little small.",
          "Be prepared to walk. You will be parking the car and from there you can walk up to coral beach. It is a very nice beach with view on the Little Minch",
          "It's hard to know what to expect when you are walking to this place - the walk is about 40 minutes, and you cant see the beach till the end, but the beach itself is completely worth it. Its fascinating from a biological perspective due to the seaweed skeletons, but also",
          "After leaving the car it's quite a walk on a stony path and through fields which for us were a bit muddy ( so wear sensible footwear ) but nothing prepares you for the sight that greets you as you stagger up the last rise. Dazzling white sand and turquoise water - even caused my",
          "Nice quite beach with lovely coral sand. Our dog loved it. A nice walk to get there, can be muddy in places.",
          "After a passing Dunvegan castle, carry on down the road for about 15 mins. The car park is small, not big enough for demand but the beach itself is worth the hassle. Lovely walk down to the beach, pushchair accessible too. There are cows roaming free, which added to the",
          "We were lucky enough to visit on a beautiful, sunny morning and were the first to arrive that day. So early, in fact, that rabbits were still playing on the sand. We had attempted to visit the day before and drove for some distance past Dunvegan castle, on a single track road",
          "1 of the most stunning beaches I have ever seen!! Beautiful walk down to the beach!! Water is crystal clear!! Tricky place to find but well worth it!!",
          "We went here just as some heavy rain landed on the island. We battled on regardless and were rewarded with wandering cows, an almost tropical like beach and seals looking at us thinking 'idiot tourists, go home!'. Worth the drive and walk across the fields. If you have the",
          "A truly beautiful beach with great views and good place to relax. Just a short distance behind Dunvegan castle by car. After arriving in the car park it is just a lovely short walk by the sea to get to this beautiful beach. We stayed here and it is a very good place to relax. We",
          "A cold little beach at the end of a nice walk. I lounged on the beach for a while and looked at the sand, the closer you look, the more little surprises you see.",
          "A lovely walk, can be a bit muddy so wear proper shoes. We sat And watched the sea lions And enjoyed the peace And quiet.",
          "Not as seen on all pictures. Nice walk to beach with our dog but please keep dog on lead as was met with notice of \"dog will be shot if found worrying animals\"! Would not visit again as beach was nothing special!",
          "We cycled from Dunvagen and then along the track to the beach. A lovely half day out and the sea is crystal clear with seals on the island off shore and in the sea. Popular but not busy and folk were swimming despite the weather",
          "Stunning views. A good 20 min walk from the car park (little ones may want a lift on your shoulders).",
          "Been many times before and still as lovely as ever, even though the weather was not great, it was still very busy.",
          "If you like peace and tranquility and pretty countryside and beaches then this is for you. Well worth the short walk on a nice day - perhaps take a picnic",
          "Busy location but worth visiting. Nice walk from the car park, toward the beach with fantastic views over the water and to the rest of the island as well.",
          "Lovely walk to stunning beach of white sand and crystal clear water. Be careful not to stop at the first patch of sand, keep going. See cows grazing on the beach.",
          "A lovely walk for about a mile along tracks, then a white beach and clear blue sea comes into view. There's a great viewpoint of the beach and surrounding mountains up a little hill. Well worth a visit.",
          "So beautiful. There is a bit of a walk in. At first the beach is grey, keep walking! I had my swimming costume but did not go in. Next time l will bring a wetsuit. The white coral isn't too sharp on the feet. I could have stared at the clear water all day!",
          "A very pleasant walk if not raining. Nice views across the loch. If there has been rain, part of the track can be very boggy, you will need to take a wider path in that case. Some of the path is a little steep and rocky so not great for the less mobile. I did see a lady with",
          "As we had very limited time on the island, I went online to search the Top 10 attractions to visit and Coral beach was one of them. Its location was very out of the way and we thought it would have worth the effort if it was as nice as what the websites had portrayed. We saw",
          "We were lucky that we day we choose to walk to the beach was warm and sunny - the walk was very enjoyable and although it was the first week of July the route wasn't too busy, beautiful sea views and of course the beach is just stunning :-)",
          "Despite being wet, cloudy and very windy this was a lovely walk with stunning views and amazing beaches, we had our dog on a lead, cattle were in the distance but do be aware of the livestock.",
          "It's a long, but relatively easy walk out to the beach. You walk through farm fields with the cows. There were even cows on the beach! The beach itself is small and not particularly attractive, but the views on the way are fabulous.",
          "This beach is defo a marvel! We could even spot some seals playing and swimming around the edges of the water. We camped near there for a night in June last month. It was very windy and it's hard to set up the tent at first but we found a spot by the wall and it was perfect.",
          "About a mile walk down to the beach. Suitable for young kids if you have the time to walk with them. Beach made of crushed shells and when the sun shines on it you would think you were on a tropical island.",
          "Glorious sunny day when we visited, around a mile and a half circular walk back to the car park. Another popular place, car gets full even late in the afternoon, .... Out of season!. Worth a visit, but like so many places on skye, loads of people! The beaches themselves were",
          "We were told we HAD to go to this beach. Coming from the Isle of Wight we know beaches. This was lovely but as we drove around north Scotland we saw large and more beautiful remote beaches so felt this was slightly over rated. It is however a very special place.",
          "Went here in April during an Easter break, pretty much by accident. Only carried on up the road because we couldn't get to Dunvegan castle. To begin there is a beach where you can see plenty of seal heads bobbing along in the water. Walking up past that you get a great view over",
          "Visited here on a lovely sunny day. Not too far a walk to get to the beach from the car park, just over a mile. Any young children would have to be carried in a sling though as there isn't a path and there's a couple of river crossings. Beach is amazing and the grassy embankment",
          "Lovely long walk to get to coral beach from car park but bitterly disappointed with the hype. Not what we were expecting at all",
          "Headed here for a morning walk with the dogs. We all loved it. Keep dogs on leads near the cows but on the beach ours loved running around, in and out of the sea. We had a visit from some seals which topped it for us. Just a beautiful beach, if it was sunny we'd definitely have",
          "We enjoyed the walk ( 10 - 15 minutes) to the beach. The parking is a bit crazy. We parked down the road a bit and pointed the car to go out to make it easier to leave. The beach has crushed coral and interesting shells. Worth a visit if close by!",
          "Quite a walk to get to the beach which wasn't well sign posted, so we asked a local resident if we were on the right track to the car park. From the car park it was a pleasant walk and the beach itself was lovely. It was a shame the weather was against us as I don't feel we",
          "It's a bit of a walk into but is relatively flat the whole way and the views during the walk are stunning. The coral beaches themselves look like they belong in the Caribbean had it not been for the beautiful cliff faces and green hills surrounding them. This was a great way to",
          "Amazing beach, blue sky, white coral sand, seal and dolphins spotted from the beach. Shame it wasn't a hot sunny day or I would have been there all day, short walk to the car park too.",
          "Lovely walk down a track and opens up to a unexpected Beautiful white coral beach with outstanding views very easy to beleive your elsewhere unless you dip your feet in the sea :)",
          "fantastic golden white sandy coral beach stretching for hundreds of yards amongst the granite outcrops in the north east of Skye. You will see more seals than humans, its very godd and a healthy walk from civilisation!",
          "First of all, on your journey down the goat path road so common in this area, if you look out the window towards the water you will see seals bathing in the sunlight on the rocks. Once you reach the parking lot its a bit of a walk, 2 ish km, but worth the trek. really",
          "This is a very gentle walk a bit blustery but lovely we always return when visiting skye. Mant shells on the beach very interesting views well worth the visit.",
          "Lovely beach just amazing. You park at the end of the road and follow the track along the beach. When the track starts going up the hill go for the track on the left through the stone wall you will soon see the beach although a little wet at the top of the hill.",
          "This place is worth a visit! It has a special ambiance. The beach is white and the sea deep blue and turquoise. During low tide you can take a walk to the small island or climb a little cliff beside the beach (behind the hill), where you have your privat viewpoint.",
          "It said on the sign before you start that the walk is a mile but it's a lot further than that. It wasn't a great day and the fog covered the beach but it was still really nice. The beach is made up of little bits of 'coral' which was really cool and the water was so clear. Would",
          "If you like quiet beaches, with sparkling clear water then Coral Beach is a must while on Skye. When we visited last week, the weather was gorgeous and sunny - the water at Coral beach was soooo inviting that I had to have a paddle - of course it was freezing cold!! We had",
          "Our young family easily made the walk, and despite the squalling downpours had a great day out. This is an easy walk, although not a smooth or flat track at all, and well worth the effort. Take a walk, and a kite... great fun.",
          "When Googling the places to visit in Isle of Skye I stumbled upon this very interesting coral beach. Since it is not far away from Dunvegan castle we have decided to visit it as well and I am glad we did. Have your expectations adjusted: it is few miles on this rural one lane",
          "We visited the beach in March, the weather wasn't great so we opted for a short walk in between showers. Easy walking and fantastic views, I'd highly recommend it! X",
          "21 March found this amazing place. Arrived early very quiet only two cars in the car park. Lovely walk spectacular views, at about 1030 the tide started to go out and within mains was able to walk across to the island. Found a sea urchin and walked around taking the most breath",
          "We really enjoyed spending a couple of hours at this beach, we arrived there late in the afternoon, so it was pretty quiet :-) The coral beach is lovely & the water so clear! There were 4 or 5 seals playing close to shore too",
          "Walk felt more than a mile but that was ok. It's a beach and probably one of the nicest on Skye but not one I would want to walk barefoot on or sunbathe on. Lovely views across to Hallin etc",
          "I have been to Skye many times and always enjoy the gentle stroll to Coral beach. This was the first time my fianc\u00e9e had been to Skye and she really loved Coral beach. The thing I love about it so much is the way in which it appears almost from nowhere as you wander over the",
          "Coral beach is a wonderful place reminding of the carribean. So if the weather is nasty, it gives an starkling contrast - blue water and a white beach (neither sand nor coral but algea shells). Our kids really loved it and the hike is so easy through flat, although occasionally",
          "We just wanted to enjoy some nature and quietness in Scotland, and Coral Beach was the PERFECT place for a realxing (and a little exercise). You can simply walk along the beach, or climb a bit more for a better view. Apparently you can see seals sometimes from here. This was",
          "My experience at Claigan Coral Beach is perhaps not very useful for the majority of travellers as I went in the middle of January. The rain was horizontal and painful. That said, the views were stunning and the landscape breathtaking. Well worth the torturous weather. The",
          "We usually go for much longer walks, but this wee gems was our 'before breakfast' starter one autumn day- we were so glad we did! An easy walk to a wonderful beach with strange white mearl sand- the water so clear and blue it looks tropical. ON this still day we couldn't resist",
          "No parking charges, good footpath and wonderful scenery. What more could you ask for? How about lovely sunshine, crystal clear water, seals, plenty of bird life and a dog otter making his way along the shoreline? All this was at the end of November. The walk to Coral",
          "This is an easy walk to the beach, about 3 miles there and back from the car park. Not strenuous although wear decent footwear. The reward at the end is a beach the Caribbean would be proud of. White sand, clear blue waters and, if you are lucky, you might catch sight of seals",
          "We walked from Dunvegan to Coral Beach it is a bit of a walk took us all day there and back however it was worth the walk, you can drive aling there is a reasonable car park, it was beautiful you just would not expect to see something so nice in a remote part of Skye. The views",
          "Amazing, peaceful and beautiful. Highly recommended. Easy to find too. Clear sea with plenty of photo opportunities. Go go go!",
          "A lovely little beach about a mile from the car park. Worth a walk even in gale force winds. You need decent footwear.",
          "Coral Beach is about four miles north of Dunvegan. Drive past the Castle until you come to a T junction with a small sign and turn left into a small parking area. Parking is limited to about 20 cars. There is a 20 minute walk down to the beach mostly on trails but it may be",
          "Quite simply a stunning beach with beautiful, clear water. We were lucky enough to visit when the sun was shining and the views all around were fantastic. A fairly easy walk from the car park, even with young children",
          "We went here yesterday and enjoyed the mile walk from the car park, along the coast to the beach. You drive past Dunvegan Castle for another 5-10mind until you come to the sign \"Coral Beach\" you park and it took us roughly half an hour to get to. We had a 2yr old and 5 yr old so",
          "The walk is worth the view of the black and white caribean beach with clear water. If you're lucky you can meet the cows lying in the sand - be careful, they don't like tourists so much.",
          "An amazing find and certainly a place to head for after a tour of Dunvegan Castle. It's just a few miles passed the Castle down a single tracked road (fortunately with passing places!). We took our hired Scottish Tourers Motorhome down this road and found there was parking at",
          "Fairly long walk there, but the views make it worth it. Weather was mad on the day we went, sun, rain, wind then more sun. It's a beautiful place with lots of jelly fish. Beach full of bones. Like a fish grave yard.",
          "As you approach the first beach you can see the second white beach in the distance and is a great photo opportunity. The day we travelled there, we were fortunate to have lovely weather, we enjoyed a picnic and collected some wonderful shells. It is fascinating to think the sand",
          "A dodgy single track road runs down to a grassy car park affair which was chaos, bit of a free for all, that may well have been because everyone got up and decided to visit the beach at the same time, buses, camper vans on single track roads not a good combination, we were ok as",
          "A fine walk along this part of Skye. Don't stop at the first beach as its beyond that. Plenty to collect and great fresh air!",
          "We were planning an outdoor swim the next day with a group and so walked in late evening and found a place to pitch out tent above the waterline in the meadow. A very quiet night's sleep and a lovely start to the next day. Parking was easy as we were the only ones there, but",
          "It was quite fun to reach Claigan Coral Beach.First the road leading to this place had just the width of one car, but people were driving from both directions. Luckily there were numerous \"passing spots\", where one car stopped to let the other car from the other direction bypass",
          "Another must see on Skye. It's a pleasant, easy walk along to the beach which is stunningly beautiful. We met a few friendly local people and tourists along the way and one or two not quite so friendly cows!! Remember to take your camera - you'll be glad you did!",
          "After a walk through a green landscape, which reminded me of Austria, we reached the beach. It was great to stay there for a whie and enjoy the white coral.",
          "A beautiful beach. Never been to a coral beach before. A bit of a walk from the car park but enjoyed the stroll because of the nice weather and breezy wind. Didn't get to see seals as mentioned by other reviewers. Stunning beach nonetheless!",
          "Definitely take the walk to Coral beach. It is a wonderful surprise to see this white beach and crystal clear, green water!",
          "The drive there is down quite narrow roads to a small car park (arrive early in the morning). The walk is very pleasant and quite easy under foot. The views are amazing, the water is so clear and blue/green and the beach just beautiful. A stunning location to take photos.",
          "Went to the coral beach n a lovely, sunny September day and it was just like being on a Caribbean beach. It is a little difficult to find....stay on the road past Dunvegan Castle and you will eventually find the small parking area. Then there is a mile or so walk to reach the",
          "well worth the walk to the beach through fields Plenty of photo opportunities ideal place for families Watching seals on island opposite plenty of sea life",
          "Don't expect a beach for sunbathing on with seaside bars etc, but for wonderful views and a small beach made up of crushed coral as very intestine to see. About a mile walk across mainly farmland (mind the bulls) from a very small car park area. Certainly worth a visit and no",
          "A bit of a trek but well worth it, very beautiful aqua water and white coral beach (when the sun is shining).",
          "Worth going ten miles out of your way for but you will need more than this to make a real day out of it. Great views towards Uig if you walk on from the beach to the headland.",
          "A beautiful site, lovely walk, in nature, along the coast of Skye, beaches formed from tiny pieces of old coral, other adjacent beaches of stone, water crystal clear, hills, craggy tors, cows grazing and lolling about. In August a good deal of people trekking through the only",
          "Well worth a visit - lovely stroll to the beach from the car park, and very beautiful once you're there.",
          "Sadly, I let the hype get to me - beaches.co.uk had it ranked as the 8th best beach in the world. Sure don't get me wrong it is beautiful, wild, rugged, unique (for the area) and well worth going with a picnic. There's a lovely seal colony on the adjacent island, walks are great",
          "The coral beach is very beautiful and certainly something unique on the island. Skye isn't known for vast sandy beaches, like many of the other islands, but the coral beaches are a little treat when you get to them. It's a bit of a walk, which is tricky with a toddler (our fault",
          "A wonderful walk along the coast to the beach. Spotted quite a few seals along the way. Got caught by a very heavy rain squall so remember to take waterproofs as there is little or no shelter.",

          "We spent a glorious sunny day here, took a picnic, paddled in the crystal clear water and played on the beach and the surrounding grass areas. Would recommend for a chilled out summers day. It is a bit of a walk from the car park, but I visited with young children and elderly",
          "We recently visited this attraction on a warm sunny day in June. It\u2019s an amazing place to visit and an idyllic spot to rest and relax. From the car park there is a walk of about two miles to reach the Coral Beach. It is a lovely place to sit and watch the sea and enjoy a picnic",
          "We took the 20-minute walk with our 16-month old baby in a pram with large wheels. We had to lift the pram over a gate once, but it was sooo worth it. Stunning beach!",
          "Lovely stroll to the beach. The sun was shining and the water was crystal clear. Would recommend this.",
          "After a drive along a single track road and no real signs we found the car park and walked along a path, rocky in places but well marked out. Over the hill and you're transported to what looks like a paradise beach. Finely crushed shells and beautiful clear water. Well worth the",
          "after pleasant walk you come to a an amazing coral beach. just an amazing place you can also get great views of seals",
          "On a trip to the coral beach we were lucky enough to go on a really nice warm sunny day, yes they do happen on Skye. The walk was nice and once at the beach you could easily have been somewhere exotic and abroad. The water was lovely and blue and the beach shone in the sun.",
          "My mum comes from Skye, I've holidayed here for years! BUT!? Why have I never known about this place?! WOW!! It's a wee bit of a walk, but it's worth every step. The colours are truly beautiful. The beach is made up of mostly small pieces of coral, but there are a few big",
          "Good parking facilities. Easily accessible. Beautiful coral beach. Fascinating to watch the playful seals",
          "Have been to isle of Skye a few times but have never been here. On a summers day it's a real eye opener as you wouldn't expect to find something like this here. Bit of a stroll to get there and parking interesting if you don't get there early. Well worth it if the sun is shining.",
          "The walk to the Coral Beach was on a good path and had some very pretty views. The white of the beach and the very blue of the sea made you feel there was a touch of the tropics in the air (despite the grey cloud). Keep an eye on the cows, they were very picturesque but could",
          "Sorry to be pedantic, but this lovely and unique beach is NOT made up of broken shells (unlike other white beaches in other parts of the Hebrides), but is actually bleached coralline algae (hence the name Coral Beach), as the information boards at the car park explain, which is",
          "You might think us insane for negotiating this 1 mile walk across fields and some stoney paths with a wheelchair, but if you have read any of my other reviews, you will see that this is a family that will rise to the challenge if we think it's worth it - it was very much worth",
          "Always worth a visit just to sit and watch the birds or maybe an otter if lucky, most people pay a flying visit but it's a real chill out corner, don't rush",
          "Easy to find - go past Dunvegan Castle and follow the sign for Claigan - single track with passing places. At the end of the track, park your car and walk the 1m or so to the beach. You must keep dogs on a lead as cattle graze here. Rubbish bins located at the 'car park'. Ground",
          "It was a fantastic drive on the small road. The drive towards the beach was awesome. It was a pleasant walk to the beach with awesome views. Had a 2-3 hours nice time. The place was calm, natural. This place is perfect for being in a place where it is completely natural, open",
          "Wow, what a beach, visited early one evening, beautiful then, must be stunning in bright sunshine. Worth the climb up the hill for a great view",
          "This is a very pleasant walk, not at all difficult, and has wonderful views of the coastline. As you get nearer the Coral Beach it appears as a beautiful white bay in the distance. The beach is not actually sand but very small fragments of shell.",
          "Lovely walk and delightful first views of white beach. It was a beautiful day, and the colours of the sea were startling. Great place to explore, very pleasant short walk, and we wished we'd brought a picnic. Skye coast and views at their best.",
          "A 30 min/1 mile easy walk from the carpark to the beach - not too difficult for our little children. Looked like a sandy beach with clear waters, but as pointed out elsewhere, the 'sand' isn't sand. Lovely and quiet, nevertheless. We saw plenty of different coastal birds",
          "The most beautiful place I have been. Clear water and coral white beach are a must see. It is easy to see seals from the beach which was a real treat. About a 15 min walk but on a good pathway and totally worth it if you are able. The highlight of our trip to skye.",
          "A longer walk than the expected mile from the car park, but certainly worth the walk! A stunningly beautiful beach on the northern end of Skye. Enjoy the fresh air and quiet!",
          "After about a miles walk from the end of the road you arrive at a lovely white beach made up of tiny bits of coral and shells, it is a lovely place.",
          "A gorgeous little beach overlooking lovely coastal panorama. This is just typical scottish west coast stunning!",
          "Easy walk to a beautiful beach and fantastic views of the islands. The water may be cool but the beach is beautiful",
          "We visited coral beach on a beautiful march day. It was around 16 degrees and pure sunshine. After a lovely walk that was around half an hour at a leisurely pace from the car park, we arrived on the beach and if we hadn't known where we were we could have been forgiven for",
          "Lovely beach, well worth the one mile walk from the parking. We went late evening and the light and views were amazing. We saw quite a few seals on our walk back too.",
          "We were really surprised with the beauty of the coral beach - after a short walk we found the beach which was really beautiful - and the coral really shone brightly in the sunshine, even if only for a few minutes ! Worth a visit and good for photos",
          "the car park is very small....blink and you'll miss it! The walk through lovely woodland down to the shore is very pretty (remember your walking boots as it gets a bit rough)....you need to remember to fork right near to the end of the walk or you'll miss the coral beach",
          "Beautiful! Well worth the trek.take outdoor clothes and boots as it is muddy in places. And a camera. Awesome.",
          "Rugged wild and very, very beautiful - a must. In February you can expect to need good footwear, windproof coat, hat gloves and thermals.... worth every minute! A lovely walk - make the effort to walk right onto the headland for some spectacular views!",
          "lovely beach! only missing some palm trees and tropical fruits. the waters look very inviting, I'd jump in if only it wasn't 4\u00baC(the water's probably sub zero!). like in most of Skye, access to this place is only possible by car or bike. I don't think there are buses going this",
          "This place goes to show you that you do not have to go to Barbados to see stunning beaches. We took our three dogs and they loved it and we had a fantastic picnic watching the wildlife - including a Sea Eagle!! The seals were all relaxed and it is so tranquil. There is a slight",
          "Drive past Dunvegan castle to get here; small car park at start of the walk. A fairly easy walk, passing the small beach at Camas Ban. then on to through the wall to the Coral beach which is just stunning. Not actually coral but made of dessicated and sun-bleached calcified sea",
          "Headed down here after a lovely days walking for the sunset. It was amazing. Lovely spot. A bit of a windy drive to get here but a short 15 man walk from the car park is well rewarded by white sand, clear blue water and a beautiful sunset if you time it right.",
          "Just a fairly, short easy walk from the car park to come across these wonderful white beaches. Not sand, but a skeletal seaweed. It was a lovely sunny day when we went and the sea was as clear and blue as any Caribbean sea. Water was a little colder, but once in it was",
          "Well worth the mile walk from the car park. We were able to sit on the beach n the kids paddled like they were in the caribbean!!!a great free way to enjoy skye!",
          "A lovely walk from a small car parking area, not a difficult walk at all - although ground was soggy/muddy when we visited due to rainfall. The coral beach is beautiful, well worth a visit - you can climb up a small hill at the beach to get better views of the coastline and",
          "Well worth the trek to see this beautiful stretch of beach. Added bonus of seeing Sea Eagles flying overhead. Nothing to dislike.",
          "Been here 5 times before but this was definitely the best. The tide was almost fully in and because it was sunny, the Coral sand looked really White, hope it shows in the photo. You won't see the Beach from the Car Park (which can get busy) so if you're in a wheel chair, you",
          "This beautiful beach is just past Dunvegan Castle, and is about a 20-30 minute walk from the car park.This is one of those walks that keeps you guessing at every hill and corner that you turn when will you see this stunning beach!Well worth the visit even in a 'challenging' head",
          "It is past Dunvegan Castle. Keep driving and you will see a car park on the left eventually. 15 minutes? It's a pleasant walk in any weather. It was lovely to see, uncrowded. A nice addition to your days events.",
          "As per title, this place is almost like a tiny oasis at the end of a stretch of grasslands. Not to mention the number of cattle along the way glaring at you as you walk pass which casually open their bowels at free will. Definitely worth a visit in my opinion. Hope to visit",
          "The hike out to the coral beach passes through a sheep paddock, so watch your step! It was an easy walk, though. The beach itself isn't that special, but the view of the surrounding waters from the hill overlooking was.",
          "Well worth a visit if your near Dunvegan Castle as it's only a short drive past the castle along a road that hugs the shore. You also get the bonus of seeing the seals basking in the sun just offshore on some wee islands. Take your bioculars for a better view. The car park is at",
          "It is an unexpected white coral beach in an austere Scottish landscape. Flat walk to the beach. I would recommend this",
          "This is a lovely little beach, easily accessible. I'm sure it would be lovely for a swim if you get warm enough weather. It is great for beach combing and it is well worth climbing the small hill for great views.",
          "One of the reasons my son and myself came to skye was for the attractions and this didn't disappoint. Travel past dunvegan castle for two to three miles on the windy road(it looks like it leads to nowhere) and the car park appears on your left. It's then a good miles walk to the",
          "This coral beach is one more bountious beautiful experience on this treasure of an island. Take swimming gear and water booties with you. The soft lapping of the sea is enough to entice you in. Just savour the swim and walk back to your car. Breathtakingly beautiful.",
          "Claigan coral beach is absolutely special. You can run around the beach barefoot, with the coral between your toes. This is a great place for families because of the wonderful multicoloured shells, ranging from black and sea blue, to purple and light pink. There are cows along",
          "This beach is absolutely amazing, as everything that looks like white sand is corals only. If you are as lucky as we have been you might even see seals just 20-50m from the shore :-)",
          "We didn't know what to expect when we parked up and made the walk (around a mile) to the coral beach over grass and stones. It is beautiful when you arrive to a stunning white beach and clear water. We had the added bonus of cows chilling on the beach! To get there you just",
          "A bit of a walk but worth it. Good for swimming. Lovely coral beach. Nothing's more to say. Jet fighter planes passed once.",
          "This is an easy walk, and you can find detailed descriptions, including pictures, GPS, etc., of this and other Skye walks on the excellent website, http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/. It's also easy to find. Take the road west out of Dunvegan, past Dunvegan castle and toward",
          "I had seen rather vague descriptions of this walk and I was not quite sure what to expect but I was happy that I decided to do this walk. The first half of the trip to the beach is fairly uneventful as you walk parallel to a fairly ordinary beach. When you reach the coral",
          "Probably one of the places we loved the most!! just keep walking and in 20 minutes you will be there, amazing!!",
          "On a dampish day we trudged to Coral Beach the walk taking around 20 minutes. When we arrived at the beach it was a bit disappointing- yes it was white from the crushed shells but that was about it. We did see a couple of seals on the way back which brightened up the walk",
          "Our best trip of the week (as voted for by the children). Stunning scenery, clear waters and a herd of cows on the beach! What more could you ask for?",
          "This beach is a great spot for a remote walk on the island. It is a fair drive from Portree, but you will be rewarded with seclusion from the tour buses. Our family spent several hours walking along the beach and climbing the hills for great views. We fought the rain on and",
          "This is a great gem hidden off on Skye. Yes, it is a bit of a hike- make sure you have rain gear with you (you should be keeping it with you at all times anyway, you are in Scotland!) and have firm supportive shoes. The \"trail\" to the coral beach starts at the end of the car",
          "While the views along the way were great, the 30 minute hike to the beach may have been a little steep for the small reward. The beach was not as I had expected and was a little let down by it. Great for dogs though.",

          "We got wet and muddy but we didn't care, as the wildlife made up for it! We saw a Sea eagle, two golden eagles and loads of seals bobbing around in the bay. The dogs enjoyed a swim and we loved the views. A pleasant walk, lots of people around as it is so popular.",
          "Driving a one lane road with passing sites while acclimating to motoring on the left side of the road made our trip to the Coral Beach even more charming. Passing crofts while avoiding sheep along the road the walk to coral beach was delightful. An easy path through pasture land",
          "This is an easy walk reached via a fantastic drive from Dunvegan. The walk is mainly along a path before crossing grassland (which can be a little wet) to reach the first of the coral beaches but keep going until you get to the main one. It's worth going up the hill behind"

          "What a great way to learn about life on the island back in the day! The architecture of the buildings alone is interesting. The various cottages show what a blacksmith shop, weaver's cottage, crofter's (farmer's) home, etc. would have been like. There are plenty of informative",

          "Original thatched huts house an incredible amount of information that take you back in Syke\u2019s history. Who the people were, how they lived and worked in such an amazingly beautiful,harsh environment. Well worth the time. (Roads are crazy!)",
          "Life was very hard for centuries for the Scottish crofters. This little gem of a museum quietly makes the point that they were tough and resilient. Many were forced off the land by lairds wanting to put up fences and raise sheep - much more profitable that people. Off they went",
          "This was one of my favourite places to visit during my stay in Skye. It is a small museum but packed with lots of interesting information and artifacts. The croft houses were charming, and they sit on a site that commands breathtaking views. My favourite house was the home",

Make sure to plan your day so that you",
          "This was much more interesting than I expected as the small group of crofts represents the various aspects of life on the Island, including a very detailed representation of a family home, including the smoking peat fire. All the buildings (shop, byre, blacksmiths etc) contain",

          "This museum is very informative. It is small but very nice becuase it is outside and very interesting. Enjoyed it.",
          "This is an evocative museum recording what reality was like for crofters on Skye. The last crofter still lived here until 1957, and his house is recorded as it was then. Begetting and raising ten children up here was surely a task! There are lots of well-presented and researched",
          "A very interesting little museum. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit even though the weather was grim when we visited. Very good value for money as well at \u00a32.50 each for adults. It's also on a bus route from portree in the season. Very handy for people like ourselves who don't drive.",

          "what a place! The museum was a great way to spend a few hours. Lots of information and the buildings there are amazing. Its set in a very picturesque location on the cliffs with views over the sea for miles. Absolute value for money as entrance was around \u00a33. The road up there",
          "This was a really interesting museum. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it for everyone and particularly for people whose ancestors lived on Skye or the outer Hebrides. It was interesting to see how they lived.",

          "This is a collection of Crofter cottages on the north of the island that is very popular especially if there is a cruise ship in Portlee. Each cottage has a specific story or occupation to tell and it is well worth taking you time. By the time you ahve been to all the cottages",
          "Only \u00a32.50 each and a very informative museum. Lots of boards to read about Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Highland clearances. Would have given it a 5 if it hadn\u2019t been for the large number of typos on the information boards.",

          "We spent around 45 mins here but you could easily spend longer as there is a lot of information and text panels. The museum is set in half a dozen old crofter cottages in an isolated spot near the top of the island. Each one focuses on a different aspect of village life over",
          "Easy to drive to and some beautiful views on the way. Several islands have displays of blackhouses and such, but this I think is the best. The Flora Macdonald gravesite is two minutes' walk away though unless you're particularly keen on Flora Macdonald there's no particular",
          "Having read reviews of this museum we made the trip to the top of Skye and were not disappointed. Each croft and building tells a tale of life and the history of the island and all are full of artefacts which make if feel like the residents have just popped out of the room. It's",
          "A gem of an opportunity to explore the social history of Skye in a most enjoyable, informative and educational way. This is a great place to bring children with an interest in the ways folks lived in the past, we were only sorry we did not have our grandchildren with us. The",

          "This was closed although it said open but the location is amazing and we will be coming back. The buildings look amazing and we enjoyed looking at them. Just a shame we couldn't get in",
          "The museum is nice, recreating Skye life as it was, and the gift shop is surprisingly modern and bountiful. They sell just about every souvenir you can think of and then some. This is next to the Flora MacDonald Monument in the cemetery, so check that out, as well.",
          "1) Nice stop on Isle of Skye to get yourself immersed and learn about times long gone. They have recreated the houses and workshops of earlier times, so its interesting. 2) Will not take more than 30 minutes to see the place.",
          "It's always interesting to visit a living museum and there are many throughout the UK and Ireland. They give a good impression of how tough life would have been at a time when the houses and farms were occupied and worked. Also amazing is how people raised large families and",
          "Even the pouring rain didn't spoil this visit much. Very interesting. It doesn't take long to go round but it is worth the effort. It does get very busy even in bad weather I would try to go early it would have been a better visit with less people in each of the houses.",
          "This place is fantastic if you are interested in the history of this beautiful island. Seeing how people used to live with huge families in tiny cottages makes you appreciate your own home but also leaves you wondering if you could manage leaving under the same conditions. Who",
          "I'd recommend this museum if only for the fact that it gives you a feel for the way people lived on Skye in the not too distant past. Watch out for the low entry ways (I hit my head!)",
          "Will never know if it's good or not as it was shut when we visited during school holiday week. Would expect it to be open till the end of the month as there were still lots of visitors around.",
          "This small but very interesting museum gives a look back in time by using various buildings, tools & other objects to explain how life on Skye developed & flourished. It is perched near the top of rhe island & is an important stop to make as you tour. You are where the road is",
          "Nice drive from Portree to the museum, a lot of it single lane road. Entrance fee very cheap. On a nice dry day it would be a fabulous place to spend a couple of hours. We enjoyed going from croft to croft, very informative. Unfortunately rain started coming down sideways,",
          "This was probably the best \u00a32.50 I have spent in quite a while. The museum is set in several old croft houses with each one having different exhibits from times gone by and all showing what life was like in those times. There are loads of exhibits giving you a real feel for",

          "The \u00a36 entry was well worth it. Each house/croft was full of accessible and interesting date. One house was kept as it had been when the last occupants left in the 1950's. The late King and Queen visited this very croft. All aspects of island life wre covered:",
          "Had a lovely trip to the museum and at \u00a32.50 per person it\u2019s a bargain. Lots of information to read and really gives you a sense of what life was like. It is dog friendly too which is a real bonus.",
          "This was a beautiful museum covering in detail various aspects of life on the island especially in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The reconstructed cottage where the family lived was particularly moving. You can tell that the whole project has been done with a lot of love",
          "Definitely worth the 2 pounds 50 pence admission price to browse this museum that is chock full of historical facts and information regarding island life. Unfortunately it sounds like they may be shutting down their public toilets, so if visiting, please contribute the 40 pence",
          "I like small museums where rural life of old days are enacted. So I was looking forward to visiting this museum. Before going to Scotland, I had read about it on Internet and knew it was closed on Mondays. Well, it turned out that this museum is closed on Sunday mornings too and",
          "Like most places on the Isle of Skye, it is probably good to hire someone to take you on a tour of the Island. This museum is fairly remote from most populated areas. It consists of several buildings each containing a different trade or skill that would have been prevalent",
          "Great place. A lot of history. Well done. Off the beaten path but worth the visit. Awesome little gift shop too. I found them to be less expensive than other tourist stops! Worth supporting this operation!!",
          "A really evocative museum in the most idyllic setting. It's a long time since I've only paid a \u00a32.50 entrance fee. Our favourite croft was the one depicting family life. Head up early to avoid the crowds.",
          "This collection of traditional crofts and their very different interiors is an excellent way to discover the history of the Skye and how many people lived and worked. All sorts of different areas are well explained and covered - well worth visiting",
          "Skye is all about the outdoors and dramatic scenery. However an hour or two in this museum is well worth spending of you are interested in the life experienced by the locals in the not too distant past. You should spend time reading the texts on display to give you an insight",
          "A fascinating look at life on Skye in the past - so much information and evidence lovingly presented in a series of authentic buildings. Lovely gift shop, friendly staff, toilets and hot drinks shepherd's hut. And only \u00a32.50!",
          "A place that you should visit whilst on Skye - where each of the \"houses\" is dedicated to a different aspect of island life. A cafe on site would seem an obvious enhancement to make",
          "Windy, cool visit to this outdoor museum. Each thatched roof house contained pieces of life from an earlier time on the island--a peak into the past.",
          "A lovely little museum of Skye life from about 100 years ago, although it showed that life didn't change much for a lot of years. Very well displayed and arranged, lots to see and good description boards. This place is found at the top of the island, along a single carriageway",
          "This is a great little museum that gives you a brief look into the everyday life of a crofter. Very enlightening and well done. There is a great gift shop on site...",

          "This 19th century croft included the thatched roof home, blacksmith shed, barn, and weaving shed. The buildings were all furnished with period items. The painted farm equipment and wagon wheels did not ring true. There was a very nice gift shop with items we had not seen",
          "We visited on a rainy day and that only seemed to add to the allure. Wonderful 'collection' of crofts with displays inside each highlighting various aspects of living on Skye at the turn of the century (1900, not 2000). It was easy to spend a lot of time reading the letters etc",
          "We stopped here on a bus tour of the Isle of Skye. The museum is a collection of small crofts that show how people lived on Skye in the 19th century. It provides a flavor of how the small community functioned. Each of the crofts was filled with artifacts, photographs, and",
          "This is a small but very well done museum. Lots and lots to look at and give a good sense of early life on Skye. It is far out on the tip of Skye but we were staying nearby so only made sense to visit. It does have bathrooms. We had a rainy start, but most of it is inside.",
          "Very interesting 'real life' museum, where you can wander in and out of each cottage, finding out what life would have been like for people living on the island back in the day. The crofter's cottage was particularly fascinating - ten kids in one room - wow! It's a small place",
          "A number of stone houses with various displays from the past. Worth a look and won't take too much time.",
          "While exploring beyond Uig, we discovered this gem while seeking Duntulm Castle. Bring cash, 2.50 GBP per adult. And more for the excellent selection of items in their gift shop. The crofts are well preserved and it is easy to imagine you just stepped back in time. This was a",

          "We visited the Skye Museum of Island Life because we wanted to learn some more about the history of the island and the crofting communities. It's not a very large museum, but there's plenty of information on the panels in each of the crofts. Each croft is centered around a",

          "Seven thatched stone huts make up the museum. They contain various exhibits. Three are more than 200 years old. The Old Croft House was the residence of the Graham family who lived here until 1957. Rocks hanging from the roof keep it from blowing away. Go if you can. So",
          "Stopped here whilst driving past to see how life was over 100yrs ago. Interesting museum with loads of information and artifacts which have been donated by locals families. Lots of reading to be done however it was such a cold day, we didn't hang around. Also information on",

          "This is well-presented little museum as you stroll from bothy to bothy to learn about daily life, agriculture, weaving, and the geology of the region. It has a coffee machine which was useful - and a nice little gift shop. I particularly liked the bothy still set up as it has",
          "This is as close as you can get in going back in time. The place has the atmosphere of a different era that is not too distant in our past but sadly lost to time. Very educational place, not only do you get a great visual experience but you get the smells and sounds as some of",

          "Came here with my family for a day out. It was very interesting for our boys to see how people used to live, back in the day. We had great weather and fantasic views from the small settlement across the sea. Lovely little gift shop too.",
          "My husband and I were actually in the area to use the public toilets, but we stayed to check out the museum! The cheap entrance fee certainly lured us in as did the overall quirkiness. It was interesting to have a walk around and brought a greater appreciation for the people who",
          "This is a must have if you visit Isle of Skye. It is like going back in time and see how people lived in this small houses. You dont want to miss this.",
          "The conditions people lived in makes me glad I didn't live in those times. The fire fumes in the small room were choking and no privacy. Very cheap admission and worth a visit. A very interesting museum looking back in time.",
          "The cottages are well set up and interesting. The written explanations in each cottage are detailed and take quite a while if you want to read them all. Admission of 2.5 pound each was reasonable for the visit. An interesting aspect was reading more about Flora MacDonald and",
          "The museum is fascinating, well organized, and very well maintained. On a typical rainy and very windy day, you will rush from house to house to learn about life for the Crofters and related trades such as blacksmiths. It is located about halfway around the ring around the",
          "Almost at the top of the Trotternish peninsula, perhaps a half hour plus from Portree, this locally run museum is worth your time if you are interested in history or life on Skye before the bridge connected it to the mainland. Good material to read, nicely re-created rooms.",
          "AS local museums go, this is well above the average and worth a stop. Flora McDonald is buried in the cemetery behind the museum and that is worth a stop in itself",
          "Driving by we decided to stop in. Entry cost was 2.50\u00a3 for adult and 50p for children. The houses were well displayed and interesting. The gift shop is reasonably priced. There is a coffee machine at this location for 1\u00a3.",
          "This museum is a cool stop for some history. There are a ton of things to read, maybe to many. The layout and the recreations in the houses are very well done.",
          "This part of Skye (Trotternish?) was my favourite and this little gem is well worth a visit for an hour when passing. Good value at \u00a32.50, interesting cottages, friendly staff and the gift shop is reasonably priced (we saw similar items more expensive elsewhere) After visiting",
          "Really nice people at entrance with shop. Half a dozen croft buildings reflecting life and history on Skye. Spend 2 hours or 20 minutes. Good summations and history.",
          "From the outside the Skye Museum of Island Life does not look particularly enticing with a few stone cottages silhouetted on the hill above the road. It is however well worth the effort. Entrance is through an excellent gift shop and at \u00a32.50 is great value. Each of the",
          "We enjoyed this museum & learned a lot about the local history & culture. The gift shop was also excellent.",

          "Very helpful staff and an amazing location make this a must see along the way. Learn about the life in Skye before the Highland Clearances and the hows and whys of the events leading to so many people leaving the area. Poignant, but very well told story.",
          "Went to the museum today for a visit and wasn't disappointed,it was lovely to see old, original houses and get a feel of what life was like for people living in them ! Really informative and educational it was a pleasure to visit",
          "Great way to see what island life was like. They have meticulously done each \"building\". If you are in the neighbourhood it should be seen. Additionally Flora MacDonald is buried in the cemetery there. Was well worth the stop.",
          "A wonderful view of everyday crofting life. The gift shop sells wonderful, local crafts and reasonable woolen goods.",
          "This was a very interesting museum not only because of the crofts which are beautiful and we'll made but also for the history and stories that went with this exhibition. It gives a better idea of what life was like in these remote places.",
          "This small museum was worth the few bucks we paid to get in, but not much more. It's 6 or 7 small re-created crofts with different displays such as a home, weavers, blacksmith and barn. The displays were fairly rudimentary and did not look as if they had been updated in a while.",
          "Wonderful - small and fascinating enough to hold the attention span of all...wonderful personal artifacts and stories, with great historical relevance. The views were wonderful and the side road up and past Flora McDonalds grave back to the main road south was a great detour.",

          "OK - the title is a little bit of a joke, but not really. Amid the large expanse of farm land and just fields - this museum really shows how life was like in the last few hundred years. Well organized and arranged (and I want to say only 4-6 pounds entry fee) - it's a nice",
          "This was very interesting. There were several cottages, all left as original buildings. There was a lot of interesting facts to read. I particularly enjoyed the story of Flora Mcdonald and Bonnie Prince Charlie. This was well worth a visit and a lovely drive to get there.",

          "Highly recommend you set aside a little time to stop and visit this great little museum that will transport you across time to the Outlander era, the authentic crofter dwellings and acutrimants of a bygone time. There's a lot of information on hand to trawl over including",

          "This was the best \u00a32.50 I spent on Skye. I learnt so much from the information there and you really get a feeling of what a hard life it was living on a croft. Also lots of varied information in files for you to look at. Should be a must for every Skye visitor.",
          "Excellent information, design, layout, accessibility. Really well maintained crofter's cottages and a small farming community from yesteryear.",

          "We visited the museum back in 2013 on our first trip to Scotland, and wanted to return when we had more time to explore. Some improvements had been made to the property and there seemed to be a few more artifacts displayed. Very much a bargain for all. The scenery from the",

          "This is a lovely site for anyone wanting to know more about original island life and the crafters that worked so hard on the land as it once was. It costs very little to get in and the best part is they allow dogs on site. You can spend 10 mins or a few hours looking around",

          "Unlike the other reviewers, we had to pay \u00a38 entrance. The museum itself was lovely, it was fun to look at the old little houses. There's lots of information, especially in the hut the furthest from the entrance. I wouldn't say it was worth \u00a38 per person, but the museum does",

          "This is a really interesting museum; a collection of crofts depicting different aspects of life on Skye in the 19th century. I particularly enjoyed The Old Croft House, which really showed how cramped living conditions were. It also had a nice collection of babies' clothes,",
          "It's only \u00a32.50 an adult and 50p a child - would it matter if it was rubbish? Canny even get a cake in Skye for that. Had a great wee visit. Beautiful scenery. A wee bit windy though so wrap up. The man working on the desk was very friendly and helpful. Great value for money.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this attraction and will probably go back in the future. Each of the seven cottages depicted different aspects of life on Skye in years gone by with incredible attention to detail. The museum is set in a stunning location with spectacular",
          "A lot of fun for kids and adults alike. Definitely a must for anyone interested in Scottish history. It was interesting to see Flora MacDonald's grave site. It is excellent value for money.",
          "This is a very interesting collection of 7 thatched cottages and farm implements. Each cottage portrayed different aspects of island life and was very interesting about 'The Clearances'. Brings history to life.Spectacular views. Excellent shop.",
          "This IS a quite remarkable museum Looking over into the sea these cottages are pure gems of a history from way back then ! Each and every cottage tells --and feels--you with the nostalgia of what it should REAL old fashioned living from times --thankfully--we dont have to endure",
          "Some months ago I was taken to this simple and moving site on the Isle of Skye. Along a single track road and open to the sea, the museum-hamlet of Kilmuir reflects historic periods of 17th,18th and 19th centuries island life. The authentic cottages exhibit the everyday lives",
          "If you're visiting the north of the island this is a fabulous place to visit and at \u00a32.50 for adults excellent value. Well laid out, with some lovely exhibits and close Flora McDonald's grave, which is also worth a visit.",
          "It was great to go to this collection of black houses that show island history for over 200years, the written history and indeed folklore was abundant,as were the well labelled artefacts and tools. The entrance and well stocked gift shop looked new and had locally produced items",
          "We stumbled across this museum and stopped on a whim: we are so glad that we did. For an entry fee of \u00a32.50 for adults, this is very good value for money. each of the Black Houses is set up with a different focus, from the dairy to the blacksmith and housing in between.",
          "After a couple of hours of driving , this Open Air Museum is a nice place for a break while learning about the life on the island in the past ! This visit was recommended by the Portree Information Centre and it is a worthwhile stop on the Isle of Skye itinerary !",
          "Driving the 19 miles of the single track road this museum is located on will wear you down, so this museum offers a nice break. There are many well done displays to educate you on the rigors of island life.",
          "A range of cottages portraying life on the islands - History of the Clearances, Family life, History of the Island. Nice little shop and I throughly enjoyed this well run attraction.",
          "Group of old cottages plus a wide range of tools and furniture store give you a good idea of what life was like for people of that time. Reasonably priced entry fee and a nice gift shop to look around make this a pleasant stop. Adequate car parking spaces and a public WC were",
          "There are several buildings to visit. One is fully furnished. The others are a smithy, a barn & several have a lot of very interesting records, photos & a great collection of tools & momentoes from the past. Well worth the small admission charge.",
          "Interesting to see some old Skye buildings. Very cheap so you could have a quick stop and wander round. If you have time and enjoy history, there are lots of interesting panels to read; fascinating to learn more about the clearances, and about Flora Macdonald and Bonnie Prince",
          "This was not the most sophisticated museum in the world, but that is wholly appropriate. We visited on a cold, windy day when an appreciation of how hard a crofter's life would have been is at its highest! Set on a picturesque spot high above the sea, the Museum of Island Life",
          "This is lovely place with a little museum that you can cover fully anywhere in 20min to 2hours depending on how much you want engross yourself in the history of island life. The museum itself is well designed and colourful. The views from the museum outward to the sea are",
          "We make a point of visiting the museum everytime we are on the Isle of Skye. I remember the founder Mr McDonald and his helpfull daughter with fondness years ago, ever so passionate about their culture and very knowledgable. Sadly he is no longer manning the post but I am glad",
          "This is a site which has a few craft houses depicting life of a bygone era. It is an eclectic mixture of artefacts. The various building depicts a crofters house set up as it would have been early 20th century. There is also a barn which houses models of a cow and a calf and",
          "This is a fantastic little museum and more than worth the \u00a32.50 admission charge. Beautifully presented cottages with ample explanations of the contents and the lives of the islanders. History, geology, daily life - all are fully explained. By the time you finish your visit, you",
          "Nice new shop, reasonable prices but cash only. It was interesting to see how people had to live on Skye, very low entrance fee and ample parking. There is a toilet next to the Bus Stop. Great sea views and a short walk to Flora MacDonalds Grave.",
          "This is a very interesting and nice museum in Kirmuir. It is a stop very near Flora MacDonald's grave site in the Kilmuir cemetery. The exhibitions show what life was like on Skye in the 17th to 20th centuries. A lot can be learned walking through these homes.",
          "It's only \u00a32.50 and worth every penny. This simple museum housed in genuine local Skye crofter buildings includes a wide range of ordinary household items as exhibits and gives a real insight into what life was like until as late as the middle of the 20th century. There may be",
          "We traveled to visit here only to find that it was closed as it was Sunday. Very disappointed. Didn't have time to go back another day.",
          "On a very cold May day visiting the restored croft houses certainly made us feel thankful for double glazing and central heating. It also made us appreciate the hardiness of the people who lived this demanding life. There is a lot of nice information packed into this little",
          "Loved the atmosphere in the original crofter. Was wonderful. There is also a smithy and loom etc. Was well worth \u00a32.50 to get in. Just up from it is Flora McDonald's grave. So great places to spend a couple of hours.",
          "The museum consists of number of old-fashioned region-typical single-story buildings. The exposition shows agricultural, economical and social life of original Scotland. Moderately priced gift shop.",
          "Really lovely little museum showing you how life was on skye before electricity etc. Lots of interesting details . Was not expensive and added advantage further down the road was graveyard where flora macdonald and alexander McLean buried",
          "The Skye Museum of Island Life is a modest museum that provides a small window into understanding what life was once like on the Island. There are many historic artifacts to view, and quick access makes this a worthwhile stop. I actually enjoyed walking around outside the most.",
          "nice wee set of old fashioned thatched dwellings with odds and ends of what life was like in the not so distant past, \u00a32.50 entry fee was more than decent and a nice wee gift shop too",
          "The assemblage of old stone cottages may be peopled in warmer weather by helpful volunteers. It wasn't when we went in April. In fact the only person on Skye from whom we ever heard a snarly comment was the woman who barely broke into the gossip she was having with someone to",
          "The road there is narrow and you have to share it with other vehicles and livestock but there are passing lanes and the scenery was well worth it. Part of the adventure, really. We're from Canada and not used to driving on the left,so if we can do it anyone can. A super",
          "I would not necessarily make it a destination, but if you're driving between Staffin and Uig, it's a nice place to stop for 20-30 minutes. You get to see how people lived in the past. There are about 4 small houses with different exhibits. The tickets are only 2.5 pounds.",
          "Plenty of parking for coaches and cars and public toilets available even if you do not go into the Museum. The cost of \u00a32.50 is minimal for adults but is well worth the visit. Small thatched cottages grouped together depicting what life on the Isle of Skye was like in the past.",
          "We enjoyed the museum inside and outside. The houses are excellently crafted and the displays very informative. You can imagine just how people lived. We loved all the farm implements and equipment including the butter making devices",
          "Fantastic reconstruction of historic bothys ....how the people lived years gone by ...unbelievable how they got by ...but they did ..5 ***** attraction",
          "We stopped there and we found a very nice place to enjoy the local life. Very friendly staff in the shop at the entrance. The ticket is cheap, the museum is nice, in some suggestive small typical cottages, Everything is explained. The tour can take from one hour to more but it",
          "Stopped off here as part of our 3 day trip to sky, very cheap entry, very interesting place to visit - the Crofts are well arranged with loads of information- well worth the stop",
          "This is a totally captivating and fascinating place to visit if you enjoy local and social history. We spent hours here and could have spent more, so will be back again. That said it, can easily be done quicker, but there were so many amazing exhibits and information boards,",
          "This offers a quick and not expense way to get a view into the former island life. The cottage is kept in style of the time, with the peat burning. Just drop the pennies for entrance in the jar and go in yourself. There's a booklet with info, but no guide, staff or audio tour",
          "It was on our way when we were driving around Isle of Skye. It's nice and if someone love history it is a good place but for us wasn't anything really exciting.",
          "Looked great from outside, unfortunately the museum wasn't open when we were visiting in February - we'll make a point of returning at peak visitor season.",
          "A good place of knowledge. its very interesting to walk around and visit each house. Lots of people come here.",
          "Another must, not open in the winter methinks, still nice to see from the outside, great for photos, sets the imagination off into how people once lived.",
          "This is a lovely museum both inside and outside. Every area should have such local pride and a place for historical artifacts and realia. You could spend a whole day looking at everything or just wander for an hour.",
          "Anyone with any Scots heritage should visit this place to see what life was like for the crofters. Unbelievably harsh and culminating in the Highland Clearings this offers insights into every aspect of the life of the people here on this cold windswept land.",
          "What a place to live , yes it must of been a hard life but the view when you walk out of your front door is unbelievable, well set out so you get a real feel of what it must of been like to live and work there , well worth a visit ... \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Situated at the bottom of the car park , close to flora macdonalds grave , this is worth every penny , \u00a3 2 . 50 p to be exact . This museum holds many interesting aspects of rural life on Skye , from peat cutting tools to w w 1 memorabilia , there are so many things to see here",
          "This place is a great incite as to how the croft people lived filled with documents ,pictures and artefacts from time gone past.its cheap to get in and a great way to spend a couple of hours or more should you wish to read everything.you come away with a much better",
          "The Buildings are quite interesting and the artifacts in the houses are of various ages from prehistoric to 1900's. The weaving cottage was a bit disappointing since the loom was buried with weaving samples from the Outer Hebrides (Harris) and one local specialty, the loom,",
          "Information Overload? If you choose to not read anything and just look around, you'll be done in 15-20 minutes. If you chose to read everything, you could probably spend 2-3 hours here. \u00a32.50 is bargain to see this museum...almost too cheap. They should just charge \u00a33 even",
          "A great opportunity to really reach out to the public but this is missed. The buildings themselves are impressive but it stops there. We arrived and after paying the entrance fee, we were informed they would be closing at 16:30. Well we thought it is small so 25 minutes",
          "This is sort of a replica of small open-air village in Kilmuir on the peninsula of Skye. In fact it's a museum of seven reconstructed cottages, set up as homes, workshops and exhibitions showing how people lived on Skye, their religion, poverty and work.",
          "I never believed that few local houses can form so brilliant museum! All buildings are filled with facilities and information, so that visitor can imagine how life was lived in past times there. Worth visiting!",
          "The entrance fee was very reasonable and the site was accessible for all. The signage was informative and it really brought home to me how tough life was on Skye. The thatched cottages and artefacts were well displayed.",
          "thoroughly enjoyed our visit and this insight into highland life. Loads of information and look forward to a return visit as so many interesting exhibits. Flora Macdonald's grave very nearby too",
          "This museum clearly shows how hard life on Skye was and how tough those living there were. The Museum is well set out and easy to understand as the information boards are comprehensive. Do not forget to walk, or drive, to the Cemetery to see the graves of Flora Macdonald and her",
          "Very interesting displays. Lots of personal items to give you a realistic feel of what they went through.",
          "The museum is an open air museum with about 6 or 7 huts where info panels and items are displayed to show the lives of the past villagers of Skye. Very affordable entrance fees of \u00a32.50. Clean toilets (donate if able!) available. A good stop for a short visit.",
          "This was a wonderful display of how life was once lived on the Isle and testament to the people who called it home. You can imagine families sitting in front of the fire in their thatched cottage, singing Gaelic songs! Well preserved, original artefacts give authenticity to a",
          "A look into the past . Well worth visiting , would have stayed longer if it was not so cold and wet .",
          "This is a nice place to stop by on a drive around the Trotternish Peninsula but I can see why people have given negative comments for when it is raining - I would not to do it in the rain. The museum consists of a number of old thatched houses and crofts showing off the history",
          "This is a beautiful place full of history of the island. The buildings are packed with original old artefacts .Apparently the all built by the passion of one man, awesome. My hat off to you sir. The entrance fee is \u00a3 2.50 which is nothing theses days .Lovely views of the outer",
          "Forget some of the negative reviews you read about this place. Its a gem it would take you half a day to go through the massive amount of information, photos exhibits that is in these old buildings, add in \u00a32.50 entry and its the best bargain in Scotland,its magic how they have",
          "We visited the Museum of Island Life on Monday, August 3. We first walked down on this cold Wendy day to the last resting place of Flora MacDonald. Walking back to see the thatch-roofed cottages the sky opened up and the rain was coming down sideways. We ducked into the",
          "A nice little museum and to my mind better than the Stornoway Blackhouses which resemble it. This one was far more interesting and had far more houses open for view than the Stornoway one which seems more into letting cottages out and catering for coach trips than being a",
          "We were recommended this museum and found it easily on a looped route around the top of the island. There is plenty of parking and loos available.....at the moment. Apparently the cost of running them may see them closed unless donations pick up. Admission is \u00a32.50 for adults",
          "Using crofters cottages as display areas is a very interesting concept, it certainly brings home the brutally harsh life the islanders had to face in years gone by,the exhibits in each croft were well presented and explained.just down the lane from the museum is a small cemetery",
          "Very small museum with exhibitions situated in different huts. There were interesting information but I think there are better things to do in Scotland.",
          "This little museum is definitely a must see for all history lovers. It really brings to life how island life used to be and is a very humbling experience. It makes clear how the many ruins used to be like on Skye.",
          "Certainly worth a stop at if you are in the Trotternish peninsula. The restored croft buildings are certainly worth viewing, and the contents offer an interesting insight in to the local history. I do feel a lot of the exhibts could be better displayed, perhaps less is more in",
          "Overall, an interesting archive of information - but with an archival, and thus perhaps less accessible, feel. We enjoyed seeing the buildings (which you can see from the road) but found the displays a little crowded, static and wordy. If you want to spend a lot of time reading",
          "All over Skye you will see stone walls of croft cottages without a roof. These, sadly, are a poignant reminder of how many people used to live on Skye, and the Highlands prior to the 60 years of The Clearances. These flailing structures were once family homes, left to ruin",
          "It was pouring with rain that day, but the cottages still looked beautiful :-) loads of information and with personal letters and also photos of the last occupants of the houses which I found very moving - gave you a very good insight into what life was like - highly",
          "Reasonable entry fee and well worth seeing , right next to Flora Macdonald's grave and so can do both together .",
          "I enjoyed going into the various buildings, reading about various aspects of life on Skye and imagining how it must have been tough in those days.",
          "What great value for money-give yourself plenty of time to read everything! There is just so much to take in.",
          "Great place of interest! You will learn a lot about Island life! Very reasonable entrance fee. And good gift shop and reasonable prices, but they do not take credit cards... Listen out for the Cuckoo, opposite in the trees , a bonus",
          "Local history and ethongraphy. Very autenthic and informative. Lots of interesting documents and description about how the islanders lived here long ago.",
          "We were driving round island and I pointed out a croft to my wife and asked if she would like to stop, we did and we're delighted with the experience very informative and a great insight to the past on the island well worth it",
          "My wife and I both enjoyed our visit to the Museum. The Museum occupies a group of 'blackhouses', the traditional Herbridean cottage-cum But and Ben. The attraction is good, and you do get a keen sense of what it would have been like to live on the island 100 or so years ago.",
          "Small but informative historical village. Self tour, good historical information about the island posted. Interesting to see the set up of the crofts as a family would have them.",
          "Very well preserved dwellings with lots of insight. Worth the few pounds you pay to see it. travel up the road and check out. While you're at it drive up the road to see Flora MacDonald grave site.",
          "This was a lovely museum. Very informative, easily accessible and surprisingly interesting. Would recommend this.",
          "Five restored buildings of a traditional Scottish west coast style, similar ones can be seen on Lewis too. The thatched roofs and thick walls are good insulation from the Skye weather.",
          "The Skye Museum of Island Life is full of information and artifacts about local people more than 100 years ago. The cottages are beautifully preserved, and each one is packed with information about family life, farming, blacksmithing, etc., as well as facts about how events",
          "Beautiful experience. Very much enjoyed the museum.Big parking outside and amazing views. Ticket was \u00a35/adult.",
          "This museum charges only \u00a32.50 and yet there is lots of information to look at and things from everyday life which really gives a real feel of how difficult the crofters life would have been. (Authenticity was enhanced by the gale blowing at the time of my visit) beautiful",
          "Very reasonably priced and toilets close by. Took my Nanna and she told me a lot about the tools as she had used a lot of them I'm her time. Good bit of history",
          "This is a remarkably cheap visit to a group of traditional houses that contain so much historical information that it would be hard to read it all. It does,however, give you a sense of how it was before the roads got through. The site is overlooked by the Quiraing hills and",
          "We came upon this little out door Museum by chance as we were exploring Skye. The buildings are well preserved and each one has a notice on the door stating what the building represented, for example The Weavers House contained a large loom, fabric and dozens of other",
          "Was only a \u00a32.50 entrance fee and was worth it. Were about 5 or 6 different buildings to visit all packed with items and artefacts. There were heaps of information boards explaining everything about island life from shoe making to fishing. Was really informative, would",
          "Cheap entrance fee and a real eye opener to how the Skye folk lived not that long ago. My dad told me his granny (who lived nearby) only visited Portree once in her life, found it too big and busy and so never went back. I used to find that rather hard to believe - until I saw",
          "A nice little look into how life used to be on the Isle of skye A stunning setting on a gorgeous day! Worth a stop & also to see the grave of Flora Macdonald just up the road from it",
          "No photos were allowed inside so I only posted a couple of photos of the cottages which were simple stone, with thatched roofs. The contents inside were very informative and a good selection of household goods, furniture and things generally needed at the time.",
          "A true and enjoyable incite to how the Scottish Croft farmers lived and worked. A lot of tourist stops shows you a world that most of our ancestors never enjoyed, this shows us what it was like for most of our ancestors. Without this museum, you would miss an important part of",
          "This museum on the Trotternish Peninsula is well worth a stop. The collected croft buildings are chock full of memorabilia from the past and the photos in the Ceilidh House are a lovely tribute to the people of an earlier time. A must see!",
          "The Skye Museum of Island Life has preserved several thatched cottages that depict what the crofter's life on Skye was like at the end of the 19th century. There is nothing else quite like it that can give you a feel for how difficult it must have been to survive in these",
          "Skye history at it's best, a must for tourists and locals. The documents they hold telling of the ancestors tough lives is enlightening. The old Black house are very authentic.",
          "We so enjoyed this taste of Scottish history. We felt that we truly saw how the Scottish Croft farmers lived and worked. Without this museum, I feel we would have missed an important of the Scottish Highland history.",
          "It's quite impressive to see dwellings from the past once you arrive near the Skye Museum of Island Life. Quite attractive to the eye! I was unaware that there was supposed to be no photography inside the huts. Most of the information was history from this very surroundings.",
          "The family and I really enjoyed the museum. There's a lot more to see than you imagine and it's such a nice visual experience of the past. It's brilliant with small children because they get the concepts more when you show them the real setting of the past. I must admit I got",
          "It does a nice job of showing what crofting life was like in the early days. Reproductions of the granite-walled, thatched homes which were shared by both people and cows.",
          "Nice little museum consisting of a few crofter houses with nice exhibitions and comprehensive information.",
          "It was the most fascinating experience I had it , during my visit to this museum. On one side the mystery and tranquillity of the sea , on another side the intelligence of human minds who knew to survive the elements in a simple and harmonious way. I will take my sons to visit",
          "Gives a real feel for island life back down the years intertwined with local history. Well laid out in old island cottages with a wealth of information to enrich any visit to this wonderful island.",
          "This is ok and worth the \u00a35.00 entrance fee, but I feel much more could be made of this place by giving a better feel of how things were in the past on Skye. Some farm machinery scattered about and some internal displays which you cannot take photographs of. Small gift shop",
          "This outdoor museum is packed with interesting information in 6-8 small croft houses to explore. Unique and fascinating.",
          "Lovely location with very interesting information about Scotland's past. Gift shop is very reasonably priced. Not much for children but wonderful for adults.",
          "I was surprised to see so many exhibits there. It shows you the way people lived just a couple of years ago. The houses themselves are a rarity in the island as we'll so I really recommend this place to people who are interested in history.",
          "This collection of old black houses with thatched roofs contains displays of artefacts from the early 20thcentury. They show the simplicity and also challenges that the island people had to face.The little shop is very good value with many items being considerably less than in",
          "We came across this by accident later in the day and really wished we had longer to visit, such a small museum but completely crammed with a vast range of interesting information wherever your interests lie: geology, social history, farming, education, transport, tourism, etc.",
          "Great wee museum . I could have stayed longer but not a lot there to entertain young children. Maybe some dressing up or something. Trying to keep a 3 year old from touching everything . Not the easiest",
          "We visited the museum on a bitterly cold and bleak day which made the whole experience much more evocative than it might be in warm sunshine. It was fascinating to see how some of my great grandparents must have lived. The descriptive panels were uniformly excellent, and",
          "This was an interesting cluster of old thatched roof buildings giving a glimpse of island life in the 19th century and earlier.",
          "If you can get over the fact that this is a tourist attraction which pulls in coaches of visiting crowds, then you will find this a most interesting detour. The setting is spectacular, with amazing views across to the Outer Hebrides. The museum is actually a collection of croft",
          "This was an amazing glimpse into a world of not so long ago. From a visitors perspective it was well designed, well maintained and gave as much information as you wanted. We spent a long time reading the information panels, what a wonderful and rich history we found. Well done",
          "I thought this was jolly good fun. It is certainly an interesting way of spending an hour or so. Some of the interpretation is quite detailed and rather lengthy. The price of entry made this a bargain and we enjoyed having a bumbler around. It isn't the most commercially",
          "Not a lot to see for the price, had the impression that Flora's grave was in this site but I could have seen it for free up the road at the cemetery.",
          "The moment we stepped through the door of the crofter's cottage, the smell of the peat burning in the fireplace brought back so many memories of my grandmother's house in Ireland. A gorgeous aroma I hadn't experienced in almost 50 years. So close to tears! This is a must-see for",
          "This museum is in crofters cottages. I thought it would be a five minute experience. However, we found that we had to be selective in what we read as there was so much information, including old photographs, receipts, letters and so forth as well as various places furnished in",
          "An amazing little privately run museum that has such a wealth of information\". What a fabulous experience! And if you are after gifts to take home with you, their little shop has the cheapest tartan scarves, hats, blankets and other wares that you will find anywhere! Seriously!",
          "With a little imagination you can imagine how life was for the hardy folk who lived in these communities, there is so much information and interesting old artefacts on display you can happily spend a couple of hours taking in the atmosphere. for me i would have preferred to see",
          "It was a beautiful, sunny day when we visited this beautifully kept little museum, which added much to our knowledge of the Scottish Isles. The guides were friendly, knowledgeable and unobtrusive and the restored buildings were full of fascinating information. As it was such a",
          "a brilliant portrayal of island life in days gone by , the cottages are all full of amazing displays and information well worth a trip",
          "I lived in Skye several years ago and had no idea this place existed, it is very peaceful and beautiful and gives a real insight into how life would have been in these little communities, lots of props and artefacts from days gone bye. In a lovely setting, the only thing missing",
          "Several croft houses with differing types of artefacts used for life on the land, and lots of information on how life was for our ancestors, some within living memory. Not the biggest or best laid out of displays but definitely worth visiting if you're in this area",
          "This museum is located on a hill overlooking the sea and is made up of several croft houses, each one displaying an aspect of Island life. Absolutely packed with very interesting information about everyday life in days gone by - education, farming, music, and general society on",

          "Arriving late in the afternoon meant we didn't have that much time to explore this tiny gem of a museum. If the same holds true for you, head straight for the little house at the far left end of the grounds. While the others have interesting exhibits as well, a blacksmith's",

          "On the day we visited the weather was wet and windy....this just made you think how hard life was as a crofter. It was a fascinating place to see. Each cottage set out differently from a barn to a house. Well worth a visit.",
          "An absolutely amazing & authentic museum that genuinely captures the true image of the hardships of crofting. A must see location when visiting Skye & Flora McDonalds grave & monument is just a couple of hundred yard beyond the museum. Priceless!",
          "It's easy to be critical of this small outdoor museum. However, if you're willing to carefully read the mass of information and empathise with the people displayed, you will glean a huge amount about the life of the islanders. It's very illuminating and sobering for we softies",
          "So interesting - amazing. Just wish we had a bit more time to read all the articles in more detail. Will definitely visit again when we have a bit more time to spare. Entry fee only \u00a32.50 - well worth it.",

          "Fortunately we didn't drive to that part of Skye just to see the museum as we would have been seriously disappointed. The museum is an effort to show the life of Skye's crofters back in the day with 'displays' in authentic (not original) crofters cottages. I echo the sentiments",

          "Nice place for a visit, but be sure yo go early in the morning (can be crowdy) Especially the way to Nest point is a challenge 1 track lane, but with a lot of passing places. Mobilhomes can be a problem.",
          "This is a fantastic, edge of the Isle of Skye place to visit. The road becomes one narrow lane and has two pinching points where a lot of patience is needed and a few smiles to show cooperation as cars negotiate the tight passes. The hill at the end is a fantastic reward but",
          "Neist Point is a hidden gem! It\u2019s is much more than a light house, it\u2019s another breathtaking place on the Isle of Skye! It is worth going, specially if it\u2019s a nice sunny day or a clear night sky! However!!! If you are afraid of narrow road... this one is scary. It was the",
          "3 of us including a 4 year old parked up and did the walk... Didn't realise how far it actually is.. wouldn't recommend with children under 6... Only did half the walk as we couldn't bear the walk back with a screaming child... Got to top and went to get a drink from wee",
          "Like everywhere in Skye it\u2019s a bit of a drive to get there. Then there\u2019s a bit of a downhill walk to get to the lighthouse. The walk downhill is fine, and would have been uneventful, except for the lady in the sandals. For some reason she decided to run down the path in her",
          "This was high on my list of places to visit on Skye and apparently it was high on everyone else's list too. While the views are incredible, getting there was a chaotic mess. The road leading to this point is a ONE LANE (10' wide) road that is supposed to accommodate two-way",
          "One way, winding, pretty long road, but the wilderness and the beauty of the scenery makes it all worth it. Didn`t hike down as far as the lighthouse, only to the highest point of the coastline but still, it was an amazing, though windy experience :)",
          "Amazing landscape, one of the most iconic in the Isle of Skye, it is also a nightmare to visit by car. This does not stop unconsiderate tourists to try and get there, awfully contributing to pollution. My advise: leave the car far away and go for a hike, you'll see amazing views",
          "The drive to the lighthouse was crowded and mostly single track and tight at that. The destination is beautiful though. I walked to the right and up the hill to get a full view. I did not hike down to the lighthouse itself. There were lots of people all over. I recommend parking",
          "The views at the end of the road are excellent but the road system can't cope with the number of visitors. That really spoils the experience.",
          "Skye is ruggedly beautiful especially when the weather is great during Spring this year. Truly a memorable trip with \u201c ...a blue sky of spring, white clouds on the wings ... \u201c feelings as we traverse across its countryside. Highly recommended.",
          "This is a breathtaking adventure for all. there is a hike and it rates not high on the effort scale but I found it was a bit harder than that. Getting there is a challenge and parking too, but it is worth it! This place is glorious and the pictures you take away will not do",
          "On the way to Neist Point Lighthouse the road can be a little tricky if it is busy. You have to park a ways back on the side of the road to do this walk/hike. There are some beautiful views (it is Scotland, how can it not be beautiful) on this walk, but you can pretty much see",
          "Hoping you get a clear sky (at least not raining) like we did, the views are awesome. Even if you don't walk all the way to the lighthouse, the walk down the steps makes for incredible views! I would dress appropriately for Skye weather and do not rush this.",
          "We love the ocean and lighthouses and seeing the Neist Point Lighthouse was near the top of our list for our visit to Skye. The day we went was a crystal clear blue sky day and we felt so fortunate. We arrived early to try and avoid some of the crowds and buses. There were a few",
          "Seemed scenic so we decided to go there a bit late in the day - keep an hour and half to two hours for this - Walk downhill is easy - coming back is deceptive since you have to come up from the lighthouse. Lighthouse seems closed but nice setting for pictures. If you are looking",
          "Traveling with friends, we found the scenery to be incredible but we\u2019re glad to be with a small tour group for background and an expert driver.",
          "If the parking is jammed at Neist Point as it was when we were there, park just up the road and walk to the top of Waterstein Head. Well worth the effort and absolutely brilliant views of Neist Point (and the traffic jams)! All you\u2019re likely to meet are a lot of sheep and no",
          "This was an off beaten path spot for us and so glad we went! The drive there was a little rough as roads were narrow and one lane. It was one of the steepest sets of climbing we did but to be honest we were told that some of the best views were from not hiking down the point",
          "We drove out to Neist Point Light House our first night on the Isle of Skye. Incredible views. Recommended!",
          "The drive is \"interesting\", but totally worth it! The climb down and back up is a bit strenuous, especially when the midges started swarming....don't recommend doing this in the evening. It was our last stop of the day and that was an experience to remember. lol That said,",
          "Highly recommend the visit to the neist point lighthouse. Although it includes a long staircase and income, it is worth the physical effort to visit this place of sensational natural beauty! One of the most beautiful places on the island of Skye",
          "The drive out seemed really long but we enjoyed the scenery and the hot cup of coffee we got from a roadside stand in one of the villages. Be aware that the road is a one lane road with two way traffic. (Not our first, or last, to experience while on Skye). There are lots of",
          "This spectacular place is most definitely worth a visit, but do be warned of 2 very important bits of information. If it is raining or misty, don't even bother... You won't be able to see anything. This place is a hidden gem in anything but clear weather. Secondly the \"roads\",",
          "A very nice view, you have to walk to see the light house. The street is hard to drive. You need more time than expected to go to this place.",
          "walk was relatively easy but left with a feeling of being underwhelmed. Why did I walk to the end of a path by a lighthouse which in places looks like it needs a coat of paint but worse of all you can't even look around. Would have been nicer if the cafe had been open at the",
          "The hike out to the bluff before the lighthouse is the highlight of this visit. What an amazing view of the water, the lighthouse, and the cliffs behind. Just know that you'll most likely be walking in some sheep manure. If it isn't cloudy, sunsets are grand. There are seabirds",
          "Quite possibly the most beautiful place on Skye. Definitely off the beaten track (most tour companies won't go this far from Portree), but worth exploring. The lighthouse was built by author Robert Louis Stevenson's father and grandfather. No longer inhabited (used to be a",
          "Great place to finally arrive at. Can get quite busy so earlier the better. Photo opportunity every where you look. Nice walk down to the end point. Definitely worth the struggling roads to get to here.",
          "We arrived at the car park just before 9am and only encountered a few people on our way to the lighthouse, but on the way back we passed lots of folk making their way there. Definitely arrive early to beat the crowds! The views are stunning and the walk certainly clears the",
          "Lovely drive down there, take your time as it\u2019s a single track road. Lots of parking available, nice little tea and coffee shop. The walk itself isn\u2019t too far but more challenging on way back up hehe. Well worth the visit. Stunning views of the coastline",
          "Following an accident last year I have difficulty walking far especially on uneven or sloping ground so was grateful to get one of the 2 disabled parking spaces at the very end of the car park . My husband walked out to the point where he could see the lighthouse and I was",
          "I last visited Neist Point five years ago. There were a few people around. But now! The car parking has extended on both sides of the road, there\u2019s a snack bar FFS. People were waiting to get up the steps... so although still beautiful, a victim of its own success. The Duirinish",
          "We visited Neist Point to watch the sunset as we were advised this was one of the best places to visit to see magnificent views. They weren't wrong! The view was spectacular and quiet, made for a very romantic setting. We were there for hours, mesmerised by the scenery.",
          "One of the best places to visit in the Isle of Skye. The view is amazing and also includes a pleasant hike to the lighthouse. Afterwards, be sure to check out the Red Roof cafe (a hidden gem) which offers the most amazing pies and cakes in this region.",
          "By the time we got her in the late afternoon the weather was perfect. Warm sun shining out of a clear blue sky, making the water a deep blue, and with puffy cotton clouds hugging higher ground on the many visible islands setting the whole tableau off. We had difficulty finding",
          "A scenic single-lane road takes you to Neist Point. The views are spectacular and the cliffs are striking. If you want a good view of the lighthouse without walking down the hill, take the trail to the right, about 10 min walk. The hike down (and back up) to the lighthouse is",
          "This is an absolutely stunning place of natural beauty with amazing natural geographical coastal features. We caught it on a lovely sunny day, which made it all the more spectacular. As with most interesting places to visit on Skye, you have to reach Neist Point using a single",
          "The view is stunning and no words can give this justice . Worth the walk , all the way down to see the light house but You have to be half fit , for the walk back up the hill",
          "Wonderful scenery all around. Beautiful photo opportunity. The view was absolutely stunning and breathtaking. There are a steep staircase that takes you from the parking lot to the point itself. Just be careful with every step you take because it might be a bit muddy and",
          "It was a long drive along a single track road, but the view was worth it!! We did not walk all the way out to the point, we had an appointment at Talisker! It was a beautiful area!",
          "beautiful views and amazing sunset, make sure that you are fit and take plenty of water, the walk back up the stairs was a mission, there are no toilet facilities",
          "You really feel like you're in some movie about an family living in a remote lighthouse. The place is beautiful",
          "We tried to come here for sunset - to capture the famous scenery of sun setting at neist point. However after driver here in the rain, we realized the entire area was foggy and we could not see the light house or cliff. Perhaps it is good to avoid this place if it is raining",
          "Arrived at Neist Point by a small bus tour (Rabbie's). Probably the best way to get there and let someone else deal with the parking - although it wasn't too bad the day we were there (Sunday). Amazing views all around. We didn't hike to the point due to time but there are many",
          "only worth going if it has rained a lot before. When we been there it had not rained for 3 days and there was practically no water at all coming down.",
          "The road is bumpy, narrow, everything you\u2019d expect from driving in Skye. Plenty of sheep and lambs with no road sense so drive carefully for the 10miles. We arrived mid day to chaotic parking, if you follow the road to the end, even the turnaround area had 2 foreign cars parked",
          "A rugged windy and picturesque place to visit does involve a lot of steps and up and downhill trek A great picture point of interest and can be breathtaking in the view available",
          "When you arrive you can\u2019t see the lighthouse and there is limited signage. This place is open to the public free if charge. There is a car park but there is no public services or people to assist. There is a cabin that servers coffee and tea but no official information is",
          "I love lighthouses. Tempting as it is to leave this review at the one line I should probably add more..... Neist point is a fairly standard Stevenson lighthouse and co-located fog horn with the former having recently had a fresh coat of paint although the surrounding cottages",
          "Be prepared, the drive there isn\u2019t the easiest, and there aren\u2019t any public bathrooms, so go somewhere first, but it so definitely worth it. The views are incredible, the walk to the lighthouse is relatively easy, there is a shop at the top for refreshments, overall the top of",
          "Absolutely stunning place! It is not easy to get there (very narrow road) and once you get there the parking is very limited but it is all worth it! The view is just amazing and you feel like it is the end of the world in the middle of nowhere! Absolutely must see on the Isle of",
          "We were impressed with the quality of the path to the lighthouse. We are a not a particularly fit middle aged couple so appreciated a fairly easy walk. Busy place, even though it was a midweek day in early May. Driving away from Neist Point we stopped at Kelpie Crafts.",
          "It\u2019s a long (12 mi) drive down a single lane road, with lots of ups and downs and sheep... but once you arrive you\u2019re met with a great vista. Grab parking where you can. There\u2019s a car turnaround point at the start of the walking path. To the left of the gate is the steep path",
          "Out of the way, but well worth it. The walk to the actual lighthouse was not necessary, but we did it not to arrive take a photo and leave, good reason to strech the legs, but it can. Be avoided if in a hurry.",
          "As with everywhere on Skye, the drive to get to Neist Point is beautiful in itself. It's only a short walk, but it may be a little steep for some, especially on the way back - there are a fair amount of steps. It is very beautiful - all around you - and there is enough space to",
          "Amazing views, really worth the walk. The walk is enjoyable but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anyone with mobility issues as the path is very steep and uneven in places. It\u2019s also great to walk up to the highest point if you like to take photos. I\u2019d recommend going early if you",
          "We spent about 2 hours wandering around, it has a large car park available and it is always very busy. Even though we came here at a peak time, we managed to be able to enjoy the views without huge crowds. The start of the path is quite steep but it is all paved all the way down",
          "I love visiting here! When I visit my gran on the island I often take a visit to this wonderful location. If you go in the summer months you may see dolphins, whales and the occasional whale shark (all of which I have seen off this point!) Its a great day out, a great work out",
          "It is quite a trip to get there but well worth particularly on a sunny day. The drive up to it is scary. I would recommend a visit. Please note that it is a steep walk to the lighthouse and there are no toilets.",
          "Beautiful place to enjoy the scenery and to expand photography skills. Although I didn\u2019t take the walk down to the actual lighthouse, the views from the cliff side were wonderful.",
          "Worth visiting. As stated elsewhere, an excellent island feature. The drive up to the car park is particularly hairy, made so by an unfortunate few who have not made themselves aware of the protocol for driving on single track roads with passing places",
          "Great view well worth the walk up and down the hill. Definitely got the steps and the heart rate up.",
          "After a long drive over single-track road, we arrived at the parking area above the Neist Point Lighthouse on a cold, wet, and very windy day. We did not know about the path up to the right to to the cliffs. We took the path down the hill to the lighthouse. We spent about 35",
          "It was incredibly windy on our day here so we didn\u2019t walk all the way down. Regardless, the views are breathtaking. The drive over is a single track with more amazing views. Absolutely worth the trouble.",
          "I went there on what seemed like a pretty mild day. I stopped at Skye Weavers on the way (also totally worth it). It started raining while I was there and by the time I was at Neist Point it was starting to really come down. Oh Scotland. The wind was crazy strong. Couldn\u2019t go",
          "if you love lighthouses - follow Neist Point super view, power of sea, lonely sheeps climbing the hill over the lighthouse - all the puzzle parts for a zen time and contemplation",
          "The very dramatic coast line can partially be seen from the car park, but to see the lighthouse you have to climb down hundreds of steps (there is a handrail)...worth the effort, I\u2019d say",
          "We went there with Rabbies tour. A long drive is required to get to the west part of the island. When you arrive, you could go up to the hill to see the lighthouse from a distance or go directly down to the lighthouse, which might be around 30 minutes walk. The view was",
          "Neist Point Lighthouse will not be suitable for everyone, the path to it is relatively steep and tricky - if the weather is less favourable - but there are steps and rails to help. It is about 30-40 mins from the carpark. If you can make it then I doubt you will be disappointed,",
          "Wet and windy walk down a cliff and across to the lighthouse for some of the most stunning views we have seen. Next time we will do it at sunset.",
          "The walk down the steps and back is much easier than it looks with fabulous views from the lighthouse. An interesting, but narrow roads drive from Husabost - must be challenging in summer. Call into the shop at Glendale which is an Aladdin's Cave.",
          "The reason: hundreds of steps up and down. But absolutly worthy. Check it out! The lighthous is very old but seems still to be in use. Probably at summer time you can visit it from inside. The sourrounding coast is full of interesting birds. Watch them fishing!",
          "Beautiful location. Advise not taking the long walk to the lighthouse, view is much better to walk up the hill to the right of the little building (gift shop?) towards the waterfall. Amazing view!",
          "Neist Point is one of the most famous lighthouses in Scotland and is at the most westerly point of Skye near Glendale. It's an easy 45 minute walk down to the lighthouse and a beautiful location to watch the sunset.",
          "This is almost too good to be true....but it is for real. It is a must see, especially for photo taking.",
          "It\u2019s steep going down the first part of the walk! Remember what goes down needs climbing back up. Well worth the effort to get to the lighthouse. The views are spectacular!",
          "The lighthouse is neat, but for me it was the views that stole the show. I just couldn't get enough of that beautiful water! It's a beautiful place, but be prepared for a hike. I can't believe I didn't get a picture of the endless stairs! It's a long walk down and feels like",
          "The drive to the lighthouse is about half an hour from Dunvegan Castle and a lot of the road is single track. We expected that it would be fairly quiet out there, but there were stacks of cars parked everywhere, and people clambering about all over the place. Initially we",
          "Well worth seeking out this great location for views and good walks around this beautiful peninsula. Looks like the parking areas have been improved and increased making access to this fabulous location much easier. Highly recommended.",
          "I drove from inverness to fairy pools then isle of skye. It was a pretty long drive but we really enjoyed the scenary. I would rate the view 8 out of 10 as the way to the top is bit steep and tiring .The shop at the location was closes a bit early so don't forget to take some",
          "Neist Point was one of my absolute favourite places during my whole trip (Scotland, Ireland and London, England) It really took my breathe away. Parking was very small, a little unclear but that was ok. We parked and then walked to the top of the big staircase. There is a",
          "Breathtaking views of the coast! Worth it. Note; When we were there it was extremely windy and pretty chilly. The drive is not the easiest as its almost all single track road up and down hills",
          "This place was easy walking with paths, steps and a snack shop to buy ice cream bar but no toilet. Porta potty should be set up here. Maybe they listened to many people complaining about it and has a toilet by now. As of early June, 2018, there wasn't any. Beautiful views of",
          "Another great place to visit while on the Isle of Skye. It was raining on the day we visited so we did not hike down to the lighthouse but the view is still very beautiful in the area. We hiked up a little up on the hill to the right of the path down to the lighthouse and",
          "The most westerly, easily accessible, point on the isle of Skye. Definitely worth a visit but the best way to enjoy this area is to walk along the coast. to do this you must be prepared for the conditions. The ground is often boggy and the wind can be VERY strong around the",
          "The car park is quite a ways from the Neist Point and Lighthouse. It is a very good trail however to hike down and then up to the Lighthouse. The views along the way are just incredible! Hard to describe - but definitely one of the highlights of our Scotland trip. We walk",
          "We arrived for our walk on a relatively beautiful but slightly blustery day and were able to enjoy most of the walk before the weather changed for the worse. The wind picked up really quickly and made walking close to the edge a bit too dangerous for comfort. The scenery",
          "Nice tourist location. Would not recommend in torrential rain or VERY strong winds. Explored the area around the lighthouse too and had a walk on the headland (quite boggy). Saw plenty of families with kids and dogs but wouldn't recommend if don't like steep hills",
          "Do make the effort to visit this wonderfully windblown corner of Skye, but choose a day when it is not raining! The parking area has recently been enlarged which makes the arrival here easy. Less easy is the steepness of some of the path to the point, (Back is much steeper) but",
          "My husband and I visited here it was a nice easy walk compared to some of the other walks we had been on while in Skye. The path is concrete all the way to the bottom with railings in most places. A bit steep in a few sections but you can take your time. Great views.",
          "Neist Point is quite a drive along narrow winding roads. But the effort is well worthwhile. The views over the ocean are stunning. The point is very windy and the hiking trails are for experienced people. There is plenty of parking but take care walking around in the strong",
          "The weather was kind to us for our visit there are quite a few steep steps to get to the lighthouse which is hard on the legs coming back. But the effort is worth it for the spectacular views of the coastline and rock formations. Beware of the sheep poo as there are many sheep",
          "Well the scenery is absolutely stunning. I wasn\u2019t overly impressed with the lighthouse and buildings. It looked like the buildings had squatters living there. The scenery made the visit worthwhile though.",
          "One of the most beautiful tip I've ever visited near the coastal area topped with a stunning lighthouse. It was very windy (but sunny!!) when we visited but than that's what you'd expect. A bit to walk from the car park and it took us like 20mins to walk down till the last",
          "You think you'll never find this, but it is worth every bit of the crazy drive and hike to get there. We went later in the day and about had the place to ourselves. Wear comfortable walking shoes (like everywhere in Scotland) and enjoy the views.",
          "Visited here at the end of a long day exploring. The views are stunning and although we didn\u2019t make it to the light house it was still worth a visit. Not too busy which was good. The roads up to the point are a little \u2018hairy \u2018 at times but other drivers were very courteous.",
          "... worth to walk around and above the parking area... also breathtaking view along the coast. Tip: go early in the morning, it is a quite busy place (other tourists, lots of cars)",
          "Dramatic views, especially at sunset. Walk down to the lighthouse and build a small cairn. Walk up along the cliffs to get the spectacular view of the lighthouse from above at sunset.",
          "It was very cold, wet and windy the day we went and there seemed no end to the climbing either up or down (way too many stairs for my legs but for the energetic (and perhaps on a better day) It would be worth the stairs. I understand the view is spectacular",
          "Neist Point can be accessed via one lane roads (watch for sheep) and has a small car park available at the top of the trail. From the car park, you take a steep trail down the hill where it eventually levels out on the way to the lighthouse. The views are beautiful with",
          "It was quite a long and winding drive to reach the Neist point lighthouse. Thankfully the weather was good, & the place not overcrowded. We managed to take some photos from the vantage point to right of carpark. The rugged coastline against the vastness of sea and sky, was",
          "Beautiful spot to check out. Take care, one way roads in and limited parking. Best to go early. This is not a place built for tourists, no snacks/toilets/handholding. Just rugged natural beauty.",
          "You definitely need to have hiking boots for this place. Absolutely stunning but not for those with mobility issues. Small car park located at the top of the walk which takes a good 30 mins. to get down due to the ruggedness and incline. It's exceptionally windy once you get",
          "Great views. Getting to the lighthouse requires quite a walk on a steep but well maintained walkway. The shop at the parking lot was closed. You could not access the lighthouse grounds. There were no story boards to give any history or explanations. Worth the drive for the",
          "There is a small car park and a step but well made path down to the lighthouse. Views in all directions are stunning. We got caught in a shower but it blew over very fast. Very calm place.",
          "It is a walk about 15 minutes from the carpark to the lighthouse with an incredible landscape around you",
          "Great, tough walk all the way up the rock. But what an amazing view !! Don't let the height scare you.",
          "At the end of the end of the world. You must deserve this place, after a difficult 40 min drive to Waterstein, you end up on a parking that already gives you the opportunity to see beautiful scenery all around. If you have the condition you can then start the big descent and",
          "Maybe it\u2019s just because it was Skye, but it was disappointing to go out to a deserted spot only to find 100 other people there. But location is stunning and beautiful. If you have time I\u2019d recommend climbing up to Waterstein Point first, then walking around the Bay down to",
          "Can\u2019t recommend taking a picture from up on the cliffs enough. It\u2019s a long, steep walk down to see a run down lighthouse.",
          "Went to the Neist Point 3 times during my stay on Skye. First time it was a total washout and strong wind didn\u2019t help. Still - made it to the lighthouse and back. It\u2019s a bit of a climb thought but it\u2019s only a short walk. Two other occasions were just to see the sunset.",
          "Although it is a very long way to get to Neist point, and it was very busy, and it was quite a tiring walk up and down many steps, it is a lovely place to go. We sat and watched the sea for quite a while and saw Minke whales and dolphins. It was a lovely day and the view out",
          "This location is a long drive from everywhere on the Isle of Skye :) so be sure to give yourself double the time than you think you need to go see it. The last 10 miles is a single track road with pull-outs to let people going the other direction by. There are lots of sheep so",
          "Been to Skye seven times and visited Neist point every time, seen it under every possible weather, one visit nearly got blown away, all 17 stone of me, but remains one for your bucket list, should be on the top 100 places to visit before you die, take a picnic on a good day and",
          "It\u2019s a steep climb down the mountain side to reach the plateau that then ascends up the peak. Note that the lighthouse is still a further 3/4 mile beyond the peak. Parking is free but very congested during summer months. Also as this is accessed by a narrow lane, any form of",
          "Busy place like most area\u2019s on the Isle of Skye. Shop was shut ( not that I went to shop, in fact I hate shopping but you know whilst in Rome and all that ) I can understand why Trinity House locks up its lighthouses in these areas. People were trying to get in all around. Neist",
          "This was one of my favourite viewpoints on Skye. On a clear day, the views over the sea and cliffs are hard to beat, so defo bring your camera! It\u2019s a short walk down stone steps if you want to stretch your legs and get an even better view of the lighthouse. If not, the view",
          "We visited this one morning without thought to finding toilets before heading out. It was a rather long drive with many stops due to meeting other cars on the road and one or the other needing to pull over. There were no toilets there. We chose not to make the hike down and",
          "We are so glad we chose to make the hike to the Neist Point Lighthouse. Every step of the way, we were treated with stunning views of the ocean, cliffs, and rolling pasture of sheep. The hike to reach the lighthouse is strenuous, but it is so worth it. This was probably my",
          "Though the weather was not the best (it happens in Scotland and in Skye in particular), I really enjoyed the views of Neist Point. Walking to the Lighthouse is easy, some ups and downs, but the view at the end of the trail will reward you completely",
          "Very busy place - but helped considerably by the new car park on the roadside - please be courteous to other road users (sheep too!). View of Waterstein Head with Hoe Rape beyond is quite spectacular - stunning some would say - so don't forget the camera.",
          "Stunning views, however very windy and young children should be watched very carefully as some of the gusts of wind can be very strong. Unfortunately, the cafe was closed and parking can be a nightmare. In saying all that I would recommend it for the views alone.",
          "Worth to see. Didn't went down to lighthouse, I guess that would take well over an hour to walk. If you are following clifs further after small cafe then only you will see a lighthouse.",
          "There is stunning scenery all over Skye and this is another example. I heard less about this than some other locations beforehand, but found I really liked it here. It was less crowded than some of the other famous vistas and equally beautiful.",
          "Great place to visit absolutely spectacular view and great walk also terrific hot chocolate at kiosk",
          "This is a hike. There are some very steep stairs going down to a flat before you begin to climb again. Because of all the walking I had been doing and digging my toes in to keep my balance, I pulled something going down. Two of us sat and looked at the scenery while two",
          "Our favourite spot on the island. Regardless of weather , the view is amazing. Walks are superb and some lovely spots for picnic. There are sheep about so we kept our dogs close but even they could relax. Parking can be tight, but usually a space somewhere",
          "The sight of the lighthouse and the surrounding cliffs is amazing, you should not miss it when you stay on the Isle of Skye! Warning: The road to the place is quite challenging (one lane road with passing places and crazy sheep), espacially for caravans.",
          "Fantastic views, definitely worth the drive. We had young children so didn\u2019t walk to the lighthouse, it was still worth visiting and we will return.",
          "You can take the steep footpath up and onto the Neist Point Rock, walk to the right uphill over peaty ground to see the views. Apparently it is a great place to see cetaceans but on the day we visited we were out of luck.",
          "Nature at its best! beautiful walk, ltd of sheep around and watch out for the sheep mess along the way but really nice views in every way. Hope you get a sunny day!",
          "Felt a bit like heading towards Land\u2019s End - single track road going on for miles, cars and sheep to be avoided round blind bends - but a beautiful scene upon arrivals. A stunning view from the top, a steep but enjoyable walk and the all-important cabin at the entrance serving",
          "Yet another beautiful place to visit in this magnificent isle. The views of the coast line are unbelievable and well worth a visit. The walk does involve a steep hill on either side, but well worth it!",
          "beautifully calm peaceful place with stunning views out over the water. lovely part of the world. nature at it's best",
          "Once you've made the effort to get to the car park down a couple of miles of rough single track roads your half mile bracing walk to the actual lighthouse begins. Wear decent footwear, it'll probably be windy, it is a strenuous walk along the up and down paths. Go to do it",
          "The narrow roads were scary and the blacktop was filled with potholes and a few sheep! But we had a glorious time when we got there. Amazing views and hiking. It would have been nice to have a toilet - even a Johnny on the spot. But we were awe inspired by the views!",
          "Beautiful dramatic views of the Scottish coastline. . Not only the fantastic views of the lighthouse but also the birdlife and the bays and cliffs.",
          "We came at about 9 in the evening, when the sun was about to set. From the highest point, we had panoramic views of the sea, and could see out to the Outer Hebrides. We spotted some porpoises and the sunset was absolutely glorious!",
          "Great view. Good for photography. Hell of a walk to the point, lots of climbing. Great if your fit but beware if your not. Some people were struggling on the return climb. You may see whales if your patient!",
          "I have to say I was really reluctant about wild camping, but my boyfriend and Neist Point managed to change my mind. I wanted to camp on a campsite, however my boyfriend hated the idea of camping next to others, the idea is to be out in the wilderness experiencing the landscape",
          "First you need to drive there on single track road,after parking there is a bit of walk up and down and up again but the views are really magnificent and pastoral. Plenty of sheep and green grass. The lighthouse is nice with the sea views. See the the pictures. The western most",
          "Bring hiking shoes and your camera (phone)! This was so very cool with the light house on one side and the higher hill on the other. You also get to see how the peat is cut out and burned. So relaxing and calming. Very very nice. No bathroom anywhere so be aware.",
          "Spectacular view, worth the visit even is long journey, don't miss the place if you travel in Scotland",
          "Plan for this experience in advance. Lots of people like this, and it is a short, but winding single track road to get there on the back side of the Isle of Skye. It will take you longer to get there than you think, and it is a long walk to get to the Light house. The views are",
          "We drove to Neist Point and took at walk toward the lighthouse. The fog was in and the Lighthouse point was completely fogged in. The hike down the cliff and on the way to the lighthouse was spectacular. Beautiful views of the seaside cliffs. Need good sturdy footwear and be",
          "A beautiful long walk to get to lighthouse. Lots of stairs and would be hard on people with mobility issues. Car park is quite small but there are usually spots on the side of the road later in the day.",
          "We took our two young daughters (7 & 9) along knowing that while this was a bit of a walk and quite steep, it is is a paved/concrete path and relatively safe if they take care. While the weather was inclement, with a heavy fog when we arrived, it quickly lifted and left",
          "Another spot not to miss in Sky. This was a bit hard to find for us for some reason. We saw the coral beach and castle first then went here. It was super windy and rainy but the views are so amazing.",
          "Light house is nice but not much there to do and walk is long. But is ok to visit. Would still recommend",
          "This is a very isolated spot obviously I suppose as it's a lighthouse. The road out to the point is a single lane country lane with passing places. It is not a road for the inexperienced or nervous. Once out there you are rewarded with fantastic views. There is a little cabin",
          "Worth a visit just for the stunning views but if you can walk to lighthouse then do it as it's really worth the effort, especially if you go when the sun is setting....It's simply stunning. The walk is not for the faint hearted however as there are a lot of steps and it's steep",
          "When we went, the skies were clear so the views of the point and from the point were amazing. There\u2019s some uphill and downhill walking but it\u2019s well worth the effort. Be patient and careful on the one- lane road.",
          "This hike doesn't demand much effort in terms of elevation, but it takes some nerve to hike these cliffs and march against the wind. We skipped going toward the lighthouse and opted for the cliffs to the north. The result was a three hour loop and lots of dramatic photos. We",
          "Pooring rain followed by a stunning sunset over a beautiful landscape. The cold and wind could not stop me enjoying this beautiful place. Great for nature lovers!",
          "We did this walk on a beautiful sunny evening, it\u2019s not a really hard climb but could be more challenging for some people . The walk eventually takes you to the lighthouse and cliff edge and is stunning. Got to be done if you\u2019re on Skye.",
          "If you are lucky you can see some seals in the see. The view is spectacular. It's a must to visit on Skye!",
          "I would classify this hike to the Lighthouse as somewhat challenging for seniors due to the number of steps down to complete the hike and then climb back up to the car park.",
          "If you want to hike down to the lighthouse, it is a big one; however you can get great views and photos by a level hike by going right from the car park. It\u2019s a beautiful lighthouse!",
          "The view is amazing. Really if you have time visit this place. It a little bit far and also you will need to wall to get to the light house. We needed about 45 minutes to get there from the parking but really you must go.",
          "Great place to visit but go early to avoid the crowds. Getting there can be a bit of a drive on single track roads. Parking is a problem. Otherwise, the views and walk are quite beautiful and well worth it. It is stuff like this that is the reason you are visiting Skye.",
          "Yes, it can get crowded, but if you are able and willing to walk all the way to the lighthouse, you can find a rock of your own to sit and reflect on the beauty. Just don't be surprised if another visitor comes over to see what you have found - they tend to do that, like they",
          "We arrived reasonably early before it got crowded. The walk to the lighthouse is fairly easy going but in places there are steep u even steps. Once there the views are worth the walk. The lighthouse isn\u2019t open to the public, neither is the refreshments cabin and there\u2019s no",
          "I have seen a lot of attractions but this Lighthouse is amazing!!!The lighthouse is in incredible area.There is no words for one of the best attration i have ever seen.All the path and the end of this is so extraordinary.We stayed there a lot of hours as we couldnt leave it.Of",
          "It's an SOB to drive here, but worth every harrowing, blind curve on the long single-path road. I've been all over the world, and this place rivals the best spots I've seen. If you go to Skye, plan an evening at Neist Point.",
          "The lighthouse is not the best I\u2019ve seen but the spectacular views around it are breathtaking. It was nice to have a walk also. Be advised there are lots of steep stairs",
          "This is worth driving out to on a sunny day, for beautiful coastal views. There is plenty of parking (free). Our only disappointment was that the refreshment place by the car park was closed for reasons unknown. There is nowhere else to buy anything to eat or drink near Neist",
          "Lovely spot - we saw dolphins (from the point where the old cranes are). Recommended to get there early-ish to have the place to yourself - it was nice and quiet when we arrived around 9am, but quite quickly got busier.",
          "If I had it to do over again, I probably would skip this site. The views are pretty, but there are plenty of nice views on the Isle without having to fight the crowds and parking. The drive to get there takes quite a while, as the road is a single lane with free ranging sheep",
          "I went out for the sunset and was amazed! It is so beautiful there! It's not at all hard to find and you can make a reservation for the Three Chimneys which you will pass on the way out there. Be sure to have a good camera because there are lots of opportunities for amazing",
          "If you are an American traveler like myself, Neist Point Lighthouse is probably on your Skye sightseeing list. This was my first visit to Scotland and Skye. It was also my first time driving a car in Scotland. My wife and I disabled our phone cellular service. And I used a",
          "The light house is a 15 minutes walk from car park and it still has ambient colour good for photography.",
          "It is a bit far, but not that much. We got there in half an hour. Since we didn\u2019t have much time, we went to the hill on the right and took beautiful pictures of the lighthouse and the cliffs. If you have enough time you can drop the stairs and walk to the lighthouse which I",
          "If you have the time to do this drive, it is somewhat interesting. It is a very long drive over some pretty average roads, but you do get some quite nice scenery.",
          "I took a drive out here on our last day driving round Skye. It's a long drive to get there as you have to drive past the Three Chimneys Restaurant and through a small village called Glendale. However, the scenery is great. The lighthouse is well signposted from there. The",
          "Intended this place to be the sunset point of the first day at Isle of Skye but we didn\u2019t stay to see coz sunset was late. Very steep walk down before reaching to Neist point. There is a metal grill you can hold on as you walked down. Pls slowly walk and most important must",
          "It's a steep stair down & back up to the point, but what isn't on Skye?, the parking can extend a ways down the road, but this is a stunning area and looks like something out of a CGI movie. One of my favorite spots on Skye. So much bigger, more expansive than you expect. If",
          "It takes a while to get here with the single track roads, but it is definitely worth it! A grand lighthouse and a bit of a hill at the ends of the world. Great for forgetting the world and admiring something ancient and formidable. On plus sides, it also has the goats of satan.",
          "We went with friends and toddlers . Plenty of car parking space. The views are beautiful and so breathtaking reminds me of GOT filming location . There is a lighthouse which is a good1-2 hrs walk and the path to that is rocky where no cars bikes or buggies prams can go so defi a",
          "We came on a very rainy and windy day, but it was our only opportunity to check it out, so we thought we would go for it. It was quite the ordeal walking up and down those paths with the rain pelting us, and the wind almost knowing us over, there is sheep poop all over the",
          "The pictures of Neist Point are stunning, but they do not do the place justice. Not even close. The sheer scale of the place is incredible. The walk is also a lot more daunting than it looks in pictures. There is significant elevation change when you walk from the cliffs out",
          "We started off the walk to the Neist Point Lighthouse in quite strong winds and rain squalls brewing around the place. This meant that the crowd numbers were down to only a few hardy folk. The long views were really spectacular and well worth the effort. Plenty f photo",
          "I will say that the view out the peninsula is absolutely stunning. I will also say that you will most likely have a couple handfuls of other people in front of and behind you. The road out is one of Skye's famous single lanes with pull offs to pass on coming traffic. When you do",
          "Pretty easy walk down and lots of space to explore carefully along the coast. VERY dramatic landscape makes for gorgeous photos.",
          "The views were amazing, walk was great with lots of birdlife to see at point. Don\u2019t miss a stop to see baby lambs and mums at Kelpie crafts 1.7km away. Cup tea or coffee for a donation.",
          "We arrived yesterday and the road towards the Neist point was a single track road with passing points. Drive careful as looks like the islands roads have had a bad winter with quite a few pot holes in the road. When we arrived they where putting some white lines down to",
          "The road as you arrive at the much larger car park has been resurfaced. Just waiting for some white lines to be added. it's a 4 mile drive from Glendale with passing places. Care needs to be taken ie learn how to reverse and don't travel too fast. Ample pot holes in those 4 mile",
          "It is definitely a place to see. There are stairs which will help you to go down. The surroundings are amazing. It is quite windy on the cliffs but when the weather is nice you will not even think about the wind ! There is also a light house in the end of the walk. The rout to",
          "If you're a lover of stunning views and don't mind steep walks to find them then this is for You! A must if you are visiting Skye, if you get a clear day then the views are amazing. Even our 2 dogs enjoyed the walk!! It's a steep up and down around 2 mile walk. The lighthouse is",
          "One of the top things to do when on the Isle of Skye. The views are breathtaking, we had some great weather when we went with my best friend (although it was windy). Make you sure you spend at least a few hours there if you really want to explore the place.",
          "Neist Point is a spectacular place with spectacular views. We were very lucky the day we went there: the weather was beatiful, blue sky, sunny, it was a dreamy experience. In fact, just like Kilt Rock, this is a view point only, there is nothing much to do except walking to",
          "I had seen so many photos of this place and heard some people who visited it, talking about it, but never have I imagined the sense of awe and being stunned as I have experienced when I saw Neist point the first time. The whole atmosphere as you approach it while on the road and",
          "Visited here on a cold blustery day, but the views were amazing. It's worth remembering though that you need to walk back up the steep path to get back, but that's a small price to pay.",
          "Not for the weak hearted or the unfit.... some serious inclines to tackle..... in each direction. Get there on a nice day and you'll not be disappointed. On a rainy day, how to the pub instead.... there's nowhere to hide from the elements.",
          "Stunning views of sheer cliffs and dramatic landscapes set against the restless seas on Skye. World class scenery.",
          "We risked high winds which I do not recommend, but we got to see some breathtaking views all along the walk. In better weather, we would have happily gone all the way to the lighthouse.",
          "Weather was dry, but very windy! Totally fine going down, climbing back up was a nightmare. Well worth the walk though, views are amazing and lighthouse was beautiful too. I'd definitely go back.",
          "Made our way out to Neist Point Lighthouse, well worth the trek, its stunning views and on a good day no problem seeing the coast line of North and South Uist.",
          "We ventured down to Neists Point in our Camper Van, which was slightly hairy in places, especially when meeting other cars and definitely not for the fainthearted. The views from the Car Park at the top were spectacular and even better on a fine sunny day. We didn\u2019t do the",
          "didn't get to see the lighthouse due to time limitations but still worth it. offers beautiful views.",
          "We visited this place in december. The foothpath to the lighthouse was very slippery/frozen. The scenery here is nice, worth visiting.",
          "We arrived as a family excited for a stunning walk and were surprised by the attitude of one of the site employees in the carpark. We were preparing to put our spaniel on his lead when this man, who was picking up litter, told us to put him on a lead. My wife said, \u2018Yes, we",
          "We were recommended to go here and it was certainly worth the effort. The road is probably the worst 'C' class road I have ever driven on so it was with great relief that there were few other vehicles (I can't imagine what a nightmare it would be during peak season). Although",
          "We hiked to the top of the hill, which looked down over spectacular cliffs and a great view of the lighthouse. Then we hiked out the lighthouse itself. The hikes were moderately strenuous but well worth the effort. (Watch out for sheep droppings along the path.) The scenery",
          "At the end of a long single track road you will find Neist point. The road down is difficult driving especially if your in a small car. There\u2019s a bit of free parking here if and with a little luck and good timing you may find a spot. We didn\u2019t bother to walk the way down to the",
          "The Neist Point Lighthouse dates back to 1909 but is remotely operated from Edinburgh now, with the former keepers' cottages now in private ownership. The walk begins from the small parking lot at the very end of a single track road branching off from Glendale. It was",
          "This was a lovely walk. My husband and I brought our dog with us who also absolutely loved it. The cement is very slippery in some parts so be careful and use decent shoes. Parking was super easy and it was easy to find. Definitely worth adding to your agenda!",
          "At the end of a long single track road you will find Neist point. There\u2019s some free parking here if your lucky enough to find a spot. We didn\u2019t bother to walk down to the lighthous3 as it\u2019s quite a trek and we had limited time but we did walk along the cliffs to get some",
          "A steep walk down steps initially and then onto a fairly flat walk down to the lighthouse. A great view from the cliffs - we went at sunset which was lovely and not too busy with people. As with everywhere on Skye the parking is small so you may need to park along the roadside",
          "My husband and I went there today with our 6 & 4 year old daughters and had an incredible time. The scenery is stunning, it was very blowy and very steep in places but it felt like such an adventure - real edge of the world feeling, with the outer Hebrides in the distance and",
          "A lighthouse in a remote part of a Scottish island is going to have bumpy roads etc so don't be put off by that. Once there, you take some steep steps down to the lighthouse to enjoy the views - which are of course stunning. There are few facilities so make sure you go before",
          "Most of the roads in Isle of Skye (well most places in Scotland unless in big cities) are single track roads. It was a very long drive to get to Neist Point and parking is rather limited. We were so glad to finally reach the car park! Then there was the loooong walk to get to",
          "Very disappointed when we arrived at the Neist Point car park. After a long and winding journey I expected far better. It was very busy, the car park is not very large and the access road is very potted and uneven with severe drops off the road edges (could easily damage a",
          "There was a very winding narrow road to this location, but with plenty of passing places all be they tight. We loved the walk down to the lighthouse but it is steep getting back up the steps and inclines so not for those who have mobility issues. Lighthouse does not appear to be",
          "The wife suggested s visit here after reading about it in some booklet and boy was it a good idea. The views and walks were absolutely amazing. Truly breathtaking. The hair raising part the single track road leading to it or more exactly some of the idiot drivers that are",
          "It's a little bit steep in places, and can be quite busy, but if you walk out to the lighthouse you get great views across to the Outer Hebrides. It really feels like the edge of the world.",
          "Stunning views of cliffs are your reward after a pretty long drive along single track road. Hike all the way down to the lighthouse for a chance to see some whales! Book ahead and finish off with lunch at Three Chimneys, nearby.",
          "Fabulous spot, great walk & amazing views in every direction. Good walking shoes are a must to get the most out of your visit & can be quite wet underfoot - tough on old knees getting back up!",
          "Like everywhere else on Skye, gotta see it to believe it. Make sure to bring a camera and say hello to the sheep!",
          "Beautiful place to visit but a long walk. Must do this on a nice day and take plenty of water as no where to get a drink also no public toilets. Must have a camera as plenty of scenery as with all the island.",
          "The road leading up to Neist point is a very long and winding single track road. IMO i would only recommend driving here if the weather is playing nice as bad weather would not make the drive worthwhile. I went pretty late in the day around 4pm as i had read that the parking",
          "Most of people walking down to light house but best view is on the right side but you have to wear waterproof shoes.",
          "As with many locations on Isle of Skye, Neist Point provides fabulous scenery. It's a bit of a drive on a single track road, but worth the effort to get here. There is not a lot of parking, and many park along the road. So be prepared to navigate numerous other tourists once you",
          "The view of the lighthouse from the top of the hill is just as good as walking all the way down to it. Just walk across on the hill, passed the little coffee shop, and you'll see all the way to the lighthouse and beyond.",
          "Definitely worth the drive to walk down and hike back up this area. Beautiful views of ocean, cliffs and unusual terrain. The lighthouse is different than any other I\u2019ve seen but the views of land and sea are the main attraction. No bathrooms but the shop at the top offers",
          "Both are just stunning. Parking is ok but oh how I wish that visitors knew the width of their cars. Clueless for the majority. This is a very beautiful place so peaceful and a place to stand and drink in the views even if you can't make the walks. Hope it will always be a",
          "Lovely place to visit...the views when you get down to the lighthouse are beautiful...it was a lovely sunny day when we visited..the sea was so blue it looked gorgeous.",
          "Walking down to the Neist Point lighthouse is one of the many 'must do's' of our regular trips to Skye - 11 at the last count. It is a long narrow drive via Glendale to reach the parking area. Parking may be an issue in busy times, as many hire car drivers can't seem to",
          "Drove from Dunvegan, and it's a significant drive, especially once it moves onto single track roads & you're dealing with passing motorhomes. The road itself is not in great condition, which is a catch 22 - I'm sure the residents don't want it improved to encourage even MORE",
          "We visited this site on our first trip to Skye! The walk down to the lighthouse is steep, so be prepared to have to walk up again and try not to do in the rain, slippery! The view of the lighthouse on the high cliff is breathtaking. We took a picture and it turned out so",
          "Breathtaking views. Easy walk compared to Skye's other hikes! Views are amazing especially around sunset. We were there in mid September and was not too busy at all. Would definitely recommend.",
          "Skye is amazing - beautiful and unique. Neist Point is one such place. I find myself thinking of how few people have stood at this secluded place and about how rugged and eternal the landscape is.",
          "Didn't make the walk to the lighthouse since we were short on time, but did climb down into the grass area where the sheep graze. Amazing view of the sea and cliff and was able to get an amazing picture of the cliff face with the lighthouse in the background. Definitely",
          "Parking can be a bit busy (but is free) and there are lots of stairs to navigate initially. Also, when we were there, it was extremely windy so be careful. I had to hold my 2 boys at times as I thought they might get blown away. ;) We did not walk all the way to the",
          "We were based in Portree and it was a reasonably long drive to get here. It is basically a walk down a hill to an old lighthouse which is not accessible itself. It is all about the sea and cliff views which are exceptional (as they are all over Skye).",
          "A truly memorable visit, scenery simply amazing. The walk to the lighthouse is strenuous and demanding so you need to be reasonably fit to attempt. Well worth the effort. Highly recommend",
          "Neist Point with it's Light House was the most fantastic spot I visited during my whole journey through Scotland. The road to get there was a little adventerous (single line traffic and we went there with a large campervan), but when you get there you'll forget all the traffic",
          "This is a very nice viewpoint on the western side of Skye. There is a small kiosk there that serve basic food/drinks, although I am not sure about their opening hours. They were open until at least 6 pm while I was there in late August. However, the road going there is quite",
          "We took a trip out to Neist Point and really liked the view from the northern cliffs at the car park down onto the peninsula and the lighthouse. There was a hut / building right next to the car park. Which could easily be converted into a small cafe / shop with toilets.",
          "We visited Neist Point as a party of 14 on a guided wildlife holiday. The approach road is in very poor condition and there are no facilities here at all. The car park is totally inadequate for the number of visitors. However the views are spectacular. You can see across to the",
          "Great place to see and refreshing. Good for photography. Be ready for good walk. Will take total of 2 to 3 hours.",
          "I really wanted to see this natural fall but the trip to the car parking area was dangerous as lots of motorists had parked in the passing places, bear in mind there is a sheer drop to one side. Two cars stuck in ditches made the trip more difficult than it should have been.",
          "Fantastic location spoilt by the crowds of people! My friend had suggested visiting as the setting was wonderful but she visited in May. We visited in August and it was an effort to get there on the crowded single track roads. We then struggled to find a parking place between",
          "A must if you are visiting Skye. Views are breathtaking. Has a long walk to Light house but is totally worth it",
          "Avoid if you are in a camper van is simply can't drive a car very well....this is a steep walk up and down to a longhouse. If you have bad knees then avoid this.",
          "Two daughters and four grandsons and I took in this site. The hike in is not easy, but worth the effort. The light house and the rockly shore at the point gave my family plenty to explore and enjoy. Wasn't extremely busy that day, but parking was not easy to find.",
          "We were lucky enough to be here on a spectacular sunny day. Spent several hours exploring the lighthouse and surrounding cliffs. Absolutely stunning scenery.",
          "Absolutely stunning this place. Was fairly busy when we arrived about one hour before sunset on a clear night. Take care on the road as it is narrow. Wellies or decent walking shoes advisable if you are going to walk on the cliff top grass as it is family boggy. Don't forget",
          "worth the trip as nice walk down with lovely views but parking limited and very chaotic . There are no toilets although there was a cafe at the top which may have some if it was open ? which it wasn't in the middle of a busy August sunny day so not sure when it is open ! Really",
          "Well the parking is stunningly bad. Quite why the authorities haven't invested $100k in paving is beyond me. If you park before the cattle grid it's a short walk up the hill to the main path. Maybe 250m. The walk to the lighthouse is brilliant. It's about a 250m ascent from",
          "After arriving at our B&B (Clach Ghlas, reviewed separately), around 8:15PM we decided that since the weather was good (sunny on Isle of Skye, we\u2019ll take it!) it would be good to check out this nearby lighthouse that night in case the weather worsened overnight. Also",
          "Beautiful scenery with amazing dramatic views of the sea on the way to the Nest. Weather was wild the day we went but it was still wonderful to see the immense waves crashing against the rocks. All that was needed was the sound of some dramatic music to accompany the scene.",
          "Wonderful views out towards the Outer Hebrides, great steep cliffs, seabirds en masse, a lovely lighthouse, great walks, what more do you need? Better to go when the weather is somewhat nice and stable, though.",
          "Went really early this morning and the sun shone ! It is a spectacular location & well worth the drive to get there.",
          "It can be a little trouble to find a good parking spot, but then your reward is a nice walk along the hills to the light house. The way is paved but there are parts that are rather steep and steps have been made to make the going easier. There is catering at the beginning of the",
          "nice drive up to the point and was busy but easy to park and plenty of passing places. There is s a coffee bar at the point of sorts which we didn't try out. Lighthouse isn't accessible but the views around the point are worth the trip.",
          "We visited and the views were amazing. We didn't do the full walk to the lighthouse as my wife is heavily pregnant but would certainly if we returned again. Others we spoke to recommended visiting at Sunset",
          "This little hike up the hill is beautiful, but unfortunately a lot of people come here and forget how to keep a place clean. Tip: Don\u00b4t go up the hill, keep to the left and sit at the beautiful cliffs!",
          "We travelled to Neist Point during our stay on Skye. The road there can be a little hectic because it is a single lane and some people aren't very good at dealing with that. It was pouring when we arrived at Neist Point and we descended the steps very carefully because it was",
          "Nice place especially with nice weather (great views!). The walk take approximately 45 minutes up and down tot the light house t(here are a lot of stairs) There is a small shed where you can buy some drinks and snacks. Parking might be difficult on busy days.",
          "The winding road in to Neist Point is part of the fun but it will be busy in summer. When you get there, lots of people park immediately where they see cars after the cattle guard and then walk in. Save yourself some time and actually look for a spot closer as you will most",
          "My spouse and I hiked to Neist Point and along a costal clifftop circuit (about 11 km and 4-5 hours of walking) with a small group and a guide from Wilderness Scotland. Stunning seaside views. Once we left the area immediately surrounding the lighthouse itself, we saw no other",
          "Not easy by any means but there were great views along the way. We had wonderful weather in May when we went. The skies were an incredible blue which made for wonderful photos with the gold and white lighthouse.",
          "We were so lucky with the weather, so we climbed down and up again in t shirts, loving the view. It is recommended to not walk to the lighthouse but go up the cliffs on the right side. The view on the ocean is great and nice views of the Outer Hebrides too. And if we couldn't be",
          "A fantastic walk to a lighthouse. We took a left at the lighthouse and went over to a crane on the coast and down some steps where we saw jelly fish float past, birds diving for fish and anemones on the dock wall. The climb back up a sloped walkway is very steep and hard work.",
          "This is one not to be missed, you can see the view with no problem even if walking is difficult, it will take your breath away. It feels like you are at the edge of the world. Parking can be difficult, there are no toilets. There is a drink van. Enjoy.",
          "It was spectacular but I'm not good with heights so it wasn't for me but I enjoyed the view no where near the edge of a cliff!!!",
          "We came with a tour group, so I can't comment on parking troubles. However, I would say to do your best to get here during your time on Skye - the views are truly magnificent. I would suggest hiking to the right and not actually heading down to the Lighthouse if you want to",
          "when the weather is good (and we got lucky) it\u00b4s that perfect post-card-scenery. A nice little, easy walk and a great view. as with every touristy spot- get here early or camp overnight.",
          "We visited this late in the afternoon with a view to camping overnight in our motorhome. Upon arriving, we found that the car park only holds about eight cars, which is woefully inadequate for the volume of tourist traffic, and roughly 100 cars were parked along the single track",
          "A great walk to the light house. The beginning of the walk is very steep, after that it's a lovely stroll all the way to the light house. There are great views, dangerous cliffs and many sheep. The children loved it. But keep them close - the cliffs are steep.",
          "The drive getting their is tricky. One-lane street much of the way, having to pull over with oncoming traffic, and sheep walking in the road. But a beautiful drive seeing the sheep and green hills and ocean. Parking at the lighthouse is very limited. And the walk is up and down",
          "The walk there and back takes a while, and there are quite a lot of steps involved. Once at the lighthouse there are great views, It was sad to see the lighthouse buildings just left, with cups and things strewn around. Some of the buildings are cordoned off. Negative point -",
          "Probably the most remote part of the island. The drive does pass some interesting spots but is single track for much of the way. Parking can be limited and the end of the point at the lighthouse is a fair trek over hilly ground though there is a path. Steep cliffs on on side,",
          "Had a cracking day for it , beautiful scenery, steep decent to lighthouse , but a must see , amazing views to the Hebrides islands . To top it off a pod of dolphins swam passed",
          "The Neist Point lighthouse is well signposted and there is plenty space for parking. The walk itself is a steep decent down the side of the hill and over another point until you see the lighthouse. The views of the lighthouse, the coast and over to Harris are amazing! Definitely",
          "We went down for sunset as that's the best light for photos but before the sun set at 10:30pm we walked down the hill which is easy on the way down but quite challenging on the way back up. We went upto the lighthouse where it looks abandoned and that there are people sleeping",
          "We had already walked over 70 miles during our two week stay in Scotland so we didn't walk to the lighthouse. But simply viewing the point from a distance was well worth the drive. Another magical place in the Isle of Sky that is hard to believe is real!",
          "Quite a drive out a one track road but spectacular views once you get there. To actually reach the point you first need to descend a fair number of steps & then walk up a fairly steep incline to the point. Not for the faint hearted or those with walking difficulties!",
          "Touring with the car around the island. Fabulous place and good weather on the day. Did the hike down to and back up from the light house - well worth it. Spectacular views and scenery. Make sure you have good footwear on. You need a reasonable level of fitness to do the hike.",
          "While so much of Scotland is a MUST DO, this is one of those that you really MUST DO when visiting Isle of Skye. Besides going on the beaten path, be sure to go OFF the beaten path for more unusual angles of the lighthouse. Also be sure to check out the charming Kelpie Cottage",
          "Coming to Neist Point, you'd enjoy the long and winding and challenging hiking to the lighthouse. The level of difficulty of the hiking is not as bad as that of Old Man of Storr, but the distance is still significant and the slope is far and reasonably steep still. Hiking boots",
          "The place itself is fantastic BUT a very steep set of steps down and back. A good view is along the top where you can see the lighthouse. It is a very narrow road for many miles to this spit and the many many foreign tourists have no idea how to use single track roads with",
          "The drive to get out to the lighthouse is a bit scary since it is a one lane road with traffic going both ways on it with quite a few blind corners and more space between passing places than most of the similar roads I went on but the drive was worth it. From the small parking",
          "We went fishing off Neist Point. We have been twice before and it's a very good Fishing destination. In order to get high tide we arrived at 4:15am. The views were amazing all the way down. We watched Seals almost all morning and also saw Dolphins. The views are great. The walk",
          "We went here on a very rainy and windy day. It was a long walk, and very steep uphill on the way back. It was not worth the hike down to see it. Also, sheep are roaming free, so keep an eye out for sheep poo, as it was everywhere, even on the trails!",
          "The drive is single lane and at times we were not sure we were on the right road but we eventually arrived. There is a small car park and if full you can park alongside the road. You cannot see the lighthouse from the road. You need to make the descent down the steep steps. You",
          "My friend and I went to see Neist Point after reading many good reviews while preparing our long weekend in Skye and the place did not disappoint. The drive to get to the parking spaces is really nice and also the weather was pretty average we decided to get to the lighthouse.",
          "This was a very tough walk for me. I have had a triple-bypass and hip problems; but, I took my time and stopped frequently to rest. If I can do it, so can you, The pain was worth it...what a scenic place!!! We were part of a Rabbes Tour and Craig our guide made sure we had",
          "Niest Point is located at the west end of the isle of Skye. You have to walk down a long staircase and around the point to see the lighthouse. It is an interesting walk.",
          "Be careful on the slopes as it is a long drop, but if you catch this location on a clear day the views are astonishing.",
          "What a place indeed. Such a gem. Incredible nature,lighthouse, sheep, waves and wind (of course). Truly left us speechless. Never have I ever felt so small and weak in my entire life. The surroundings were just almighty. And oh those rock stacks",
          "This place gave me such a feeling that, it is too hard to explain in words. Breath takingly beautiful in an island littered with beautiful spectacles. I wish i would've stayed there for couple of days more! Don't miss it and rent a car to get here.",
          "It is worth the drive to Neist Point just to see the greens of the hills, the blue of the ocean and the dark looming cliffs. It is a bit of a hike down to the lighthouse, but well worth the effort, not so much in the destination but in the varied views you get along the way.",
          "I came here last year. I thought I reviewed it at the time however it appears not. This location was the #1 area I wanted to visit on the island. We stopped at Dunvegan to get a coffee where I evaluated the logistical operation of getting to the peninsula. Despite the reluctance",
          "if you're up to it, you can certainly trek to find the lighthouse. The incredible views alone were enough for me.",
          "We hiked out to the lighthouse and were blown away with the beauty. First of all you have to get to Neist Point which is an adventure itself. Being New to Scotland driving, this was a true adventure. The drive from the main road is single track and you definitely need to pay",
          "To get there you travel along miles of spectacular single track roads, along some lovely sea lochs. Parking is a bit haphazard but seems to work. To access the Lighthouse there is a path that is provided with steps and a handrail were it's needed. The setting is stunning, the",
          "What a fantastic place , we did not know exactly what to expect, long drive to get there, but worth the effort, small car park, lovely walk before you reach the lighthouse ,but great views as you are walking, you need to be physically fit as it is steep and there are quite a",
          "not too demanding in an amazing landscape. There's a small parking area at the top of the hill, then you walk quite downward, then upward till an abandoned lighthouse. Windy, green, sheeps...a dream. And it makes you feel at the edge of the world. Let's go there.",
          "Stunning views!!!! If you have the time this is a must see! The road to get there is 15 miles on a single road with passing points so allow a lot of extra time. It is best if you take a smaller car, save yourself a headache. Large vans or campers may find it hard to park and",
          "A gorgeous place that not many people visit. You seem to have it all to yourself. Just a breathtaking view.",
          "The drive to the lighthouse is beautiful, although much of it is on a one-track road, so mind the oncoming cars and the sheep! But the scenery is really stunning. We arrived at the lighthouse later in the evening, but of course the sun was still high in the sky. There weren't",
          "Long climb down (and up) the stairs but the view is amazing! You do need good footwear, and the cliffs are steep, so don't wander too close, but well worth the effort.",
          "The drive out to Neist Point, much of it on single track roads, takes a little getting used to, but it is well worth the trip. There are some marvelous shoreline views, and the walk down to see the lighthouse is quite a hike.",
          "Once you complete the drive over on one lane roads, be ready for a substantial hike if you want to see the lighthouse because it is down quite a ways and you cannot see it from the parking area. The surrounding views are amazing, even if you don't hike down to the lighthouse.",
          "After a neat little drive out and down a lot of windy roads with passing points to some great views at the end of the road. Just head down early to avoid the traffic of the daytime. The car park at the other end is limited so everyone just has to work in. Good footwear is",
          "It is well worth the effort to drive to Neist Point and then the walk to the lighthouse from the car park. I am pretty sure that it is the most westerly point on Skye and the dramatic cliff scenery will linger long in your memories.",
          "No special footwear required. We only walked to the lighthouse area. Decent paths and steps makes outward walk good. Got to the lighthouse which is now unmanned and thus the buildings are now neglected and out of bounds. the views are great and good for ''whale watching'',but",
          "Due to limited time we did not do the whole walk which requires one to climb down the steps, instead we walked up the hill on the right and enjoyed the great views. Get there early to avoid the crowds. Parking can be a bit tight especially as the motor homes and busses come",
          "Beautiful place! I didn't realize it would be such a hike to the top of the point and back up the hill to parking but it was well worth it. Just be sure you have your walking shoes on.",
          "Rains, winds and a continuously threatening sky didn't keep us from walking to the lighthouse at Neist point. There's a car park which was almost full inspite of the outside conditions. We found a spot on the road. From the level of the car park, the light house is two cliffs",
          "The slow advance with the single track route was well worth the wait, we were treated to the most wonderful views across the sea to the outer Hebrides, very special The walk to Neist Point was somewhat spoilt with the detritus around the lighthouse complex but to see the huge",
          "The view is fantastic. The walk down is easy due to steps and downhill. You don't have to walk all the way to lighthouse. Halfway near the cliff is good. Very strong wind and the slope down is slippery after rain and I fell down on the slope. Leave some energy for the climb back",
          "A really lovely place to visit, but make sure you have adequate footwear. We spent a good few hours here and although there are some places a bit more difficult to walk to, you can always just sit and enjoy the view. Our son went down to the lighthouse, which unfortunately is",
          "The most amazing views I could have ever seen if there were no clouds and foggy day.my only regret in is le of skye. I will d\u00e9finie go back to see what I couldn't see. Choose a nice day and drive around 30 min to have the most beautiful pic you can have in this isle.",
          "I did some research before hand to limit the amount of walking - both length and elevation. I looked at the Googleimages and the locations from which they were taken and deduced correctly that the lighthouse could be viewed and photographed without having to go down the steps,",
          "C'mon Scottish tourist board do something or have something done about the lighthouse, the car park and the access. This is a gold mine of a natural wonder tourist attraction. This is the equal of the Cliffs of Moher imho but is in serious need of an infrastructure upgrade. If",
          "Well worth the drive to Neist Point. Spectacular scenery. Take the walk to the lighthouse, the views all around are tremendous.",
          "Instead of hiking across to the lighthouse we climbed up behind the car park. We sat on the side of the cliff and had a great view of the lighthouse, whilst watching the various birds coming and going from the cliffs. Beautiful and peaceful. Does get very windy and chilly up",
          "Visited Neist Point to see the sunset and it was stunning. A bit out of the way and the one lane road cam be a challenge so allow extra time. Lovely sunset and beautiful views!",
          "One of the most beautiful places we have visited on Isle of Skye. Sadly, we didn't have enough time to go all the way to the light house. But the view alone is second to none. We were lucky that the moment we arrived, the sun came out. So picturesque, you'd think you're in a",
          "I made the trip out to Neist Point on a wet and very windy afternoon, which I would imagine is probably quite typical of what to expect from the conditions there given how remote it is. You access the start of the walk from a car park that has room for just a few cars at the",
          "Parking is limited. This is a very steep walk - not so good, in my opinion, if slippy underfoot but what amazing views when you get about 2/3 of the way to the light house.",
          "We visited in May with the sun shining, a fanntastic location and amazing views. One of a number of fantastic places on the Isle of Skye.",
          "Don't be fooled reaching the lighthouse isn't done without a sharp decline and incline out of the dip beforehand, certainly gets the heart pumping before you reach the lighthouse and see the great views out to sea.",
          "Great walk to the light house Stunning scenery Fabulous single track roads with passing places Worth the trip",
          "Really nice spot on Skye. Once you have past the lighthouse I would recommend taking a packed lunch and sitting on the rocks looking for wildlife. In the twos times I have been we have seen seals, Dolphins and Whales. I hear Basking sharks are also a common sight.",
          "Even with the strong winds, mud, and inadequate parking at the end of a desolate single track road with limited visibility around several curves this is a must see attraction on the isle of Skye. We were advised by Linda Jackson (kelpie cottage) to avoid hiking down to the",
          "It was like being on another planet, amazing the scenery and the views unbelievable. Apparently the light house is for sale! It would be a long walk down the driveway!",
          "Lengthy walk from very small parking area after travel down single track road. Not for people with any walking problems or heart conditions. Down many steps, further slopes, then up and over further hill. Well worth the view at the end.",
          "I didnt really plan for this point. Just arrived there while driving all over Isle of Skye. But thank god I visited the place. Steep cliffs a long hike up to the cliff jutting out of the main coast gives great views of both the coastline and th light house. We had both rains and",
          "We stopped here with a small tour around 4pm on a weekend and the parking lot was basically full. Once I saw the views it was clear to see why. From just past the parking lot the views of the water and cliffs are amazing. I did the walk which for an in-shape person is fine (but",
          "Do do a circular walk and really experience the spectacular views rather than just walking to the lighthouse. Take good footwear.",
          "A stunning area to visit. The walk to and from the lighthouse takes a bit of effort, but is well worth it. Parking is interesting! Not much space, but with care and thought it's fine. I took a 24' motorhome there and stayed overnight, stunning sunset and rise.",
          "It's almost on the edge of Skye and you have got some driving to do. Once reaching the spot there is a small car parking so would advise to reach there early to avoid rush. After that you can walk up-to the lighthouse in about 30 minutes walk down the stairs, but if you want to",
          "Stunning views after an invigorating walk. The health & safety police haven't reached this part of Skye so use your common sense and be careful when looking over the cliffs; it's a long way to fall. However, the views will take your breath away and it's well worth the track to",
          "This is an invigorating walk at the most westerly point on Skye and is a direct path with a return by the same route. Total length of the walk is 1\u00bc mile (2.2 km) and there are steps at the steepest part. There is a small car park which is at the end of a 3\u00bd mile (5.6 km) single",
          "...the lighthouse is, oddly, filled with rubbish. Keep a distance to help the romance stay alive. Easy walk up and down as there are concrete stairs.",
          "Neist point is a stunning peninsular at the end of a narrow winding road with very little parking for the crowds. There are currently no facilities there. The walk down to the lighthouse is an easy downhill stroll, the walk back up is a slightly more challenging uphill slog -",
          "A bit out the way on a single track road which is steep in some parts. Small parking area...good that natural habitat hasn't been ruined but busy even in low season. Amazing views and beautiful weathered coastline...just a taste of what Scotland and the rest of Britain's",
          "Lovely walk from the car park, beautiful views, tranquil setting. Tricky road to get there but worth it!",
          "The walk to the lighthouse was beautiful and dramatic, the surrounding views are spectacular, but the lighthouse itself was very disappointing, there were broken windows, rubbish strewn outside on the grass and broken bottles etc. no wonder one of the sheep had a serious leg",
          "Unbelievable my young son of three and a half year old able to reach to the Lighthouse his own. He loves sheep. Great place for peace and scenery lover, Although needs lots of energy. It's single line road almost for 30 minutes, so be careful during driving.",
          "Took a group of visitors to this location, by there request. Lovely place to visit. Great views, and an joyous walk down to the lighthouse. Its a must if your a visitor to the island of Skye. A great end to a fantastic tour with lovely people.",
          "beautiful place to visit, views are just breathtaking, easy parking. bit disappointed at how the lighthouse has been allowed to go to ruin with trash lying everywhere, would expect Skye council or the tourist board to clean it up a bit, it got there, sure it can't be that",
          "It's worth the drive to get here. Do make it out to the lighthouse....steps are steep though. Still...magical place for a picnic :)",
          "It is a long drive down single track roads which would be interesting in the summer! The parking is quite restricted for the number of people visiting. All of this is well worth the pain just for the views and the feeling of the place. We never walked out to the lighthouse as",
          "A lovely walk down to the lighthouse. Quite steep - especially on the way back up! I love lighthouses so was keen to see this one as it's in a lovely setting. There were some interesting relics left around - a pulley system for transporting goods up and down the hill, an old",
          "Well worth the drive to see this, spectacular setting that was on my bucket list to see. There isn't much at the site itself but a few cafe's on the route in Glendale including the lovely Cafe Lephin on the main road and the Red Roof Cafe & Gallery nearby for catching your",
          "Don't get too excited about it before you get there, it is an old working lighthouse and accommodation that has seen the ravages of time and vandalism, but I found it interesting The drive down from the main road takes about 10 minutes, the road is single lane, mostly good",
          "The picture perfect lighthouse spot! The views are stunning. The drive is quite difficult. But with a good navigation system it'll be easy. And the walk down from the top is quite a trek. However, the views make up for everything. A must visit in Skye!",
          "Amazing scenery , busy with lots of visitors . Long walk down the steps and then a further distance to see the lighthouse . Very strenuous walk back up , not for the unfit especially on a warm day",
          "So, I am unable to climb and walk far without assistance, however, this is worth the drive, even if you cannot make the final walk/climb to the point or lighthouse. The scenery is out of this world, the feeling is amazing. Go, experience, it is worth the scary road to get there,",
          "Nice place to visit. You will need to walk around 2 km from the car park to the lighthouse, but the scenery is really fantastic.",
          "My husband and I made the trek out to Neist Point on a VERY windy day in December 2016. The area is beautiful and very much worth the effort to get out there. There is a small car park at the top, which leads to the stairs which begin the initial part of the climb. For better",
          "We were here in March so it was quiet, beautiful day, lovely scenery. As has been said before there are quiet a few steps down, it's absolutely fine but it is steep going back up, so if your not the fittest you'll have to take your time. It's quiet safe though. Enjoy \ud83d\ude00",
          "Car park is the last stretch of road on the west coast of the island. Parked up on top of a hill, you walk down a well set path and steps. About 2km there and back, steep steps. Spectacular views. Another must visit for Skye, cracking views at sunset.",
          "Neist point is well worth the long journey down single track roads. When you get there you truly feel like you have reached worlds end. It's a great walk and stunning site which makes you feel truly small (in a good way). The views are breath taking and it's so peaceful. It was",
          "Worth the long drive of single track roads and passing places to get there. We were very lucky with the weather the day we were there, blue skies and sunshine, and the views are spectacular. We walked along the headland from the car park to start with until we could see the",
          "Really interesting place to visit. The buildings are falling into disrepair but this somehow adds something. Natural scenery is spectacular and the journey to the car park takes you through lovely settlements of traditional houses (do visit the shop on the way which has",
          "This is the furthest west point of Isle of Skye. It is a long up and down hike to get the first view of the lighthouse and the Atlantic. There is then a second significant hike to the point. We went on a cold and rainy day and didn't make the second hike. Recommend doing this on",
          "A glorious winter's day on Skye with clear blue cloudless skies we could see from the south of South Uist all the way to the south of Lewis, almost all the outer Isles in one. Slightly disappointed in not seeing any marine mammals or many birds but I'd like to go back later on",
          "The walk to Neist Point and its lighthouse is reached from a car park at the top of the cliff. The marked path consists of a steep slope made up of steps and sloping path. It is definitely not for anyone who is unfit as the walk back up the cliffside is VERY steep! The weather",
          "We got here around lunchtime, the sky was clear and the sun was out giving us great views. The walk is only short but very steep coming back to the car park. Well worth a visit.",
          "A little longer than it looks but really a great hike with the reward of cool lighthouse and sweeping views of the coastline. Don't be afraid to continue to the water and walk the rocks if it's not too boggy.",
          "Another windy windy cold winters day that we visited Neist Point. The walk down is easier...down hill all the way. It was so windy waterfalls were being blown back up in the air. Again the effort was worth it, a must do on your Isle of Skye visit",
          "This place is a bit of a drive (depending on where you're staying) but absolutely worth it. There is an enjoyable walk to reach the lighthouse and all the while you will be rewarded with beautiful views and a fresh ocean breeze. We saw an amazing winter sunset.",
          "Wowee! The winds were so strong I could lean back into them without falling over! But the view at sunset was just spectacular - even on our cold wintery day. We trekked down the bluff to overlook the lighthouse and were treated to red, orange, purple skies, blue and white",
          "No matter which direction you look, the scenery is so beautiful - the cliff, the sea, the vegetation, the sheep, the rocks. And you can suck in the views from whatever point you decide to stop along the easy walk from the parking area to the lighthouse. Do not forget to head",
          "It was a long, blustery hike out to Neist Point in December but worth the effort! We loved it! It was raining and windy but our tour guide persuaded us to try the hike and we are so glad we made the effort. Bundle up though.",
          "A lovely place, beautiful view of the surroundings. From the top of the cliff overlooking the sea looming, pastoral landscape, the silence around addictive. Dress well on cold days that the winds are blowing strong.",
          "Well worth a visit and a photographers paradise for sunsets and northern lights so can get quite busy. Although there is plenty of parking it gets quite full and then people park on the sides of the road which is quite narrow and full of potholes. The scenery is amazing,",
          "I had a chance to visit Scotland in June 2015 along with my friend. We decided to Go Visit Northern Highland and island which we had heard is the most beautiful part of Scotland. We had the Map and our own rented car so we could enjoy the freedom of stopping wherever we want",

          "Windy cliff top views and a steep walk down to the lighthouse and rock formations. It's not too difficult but wouldn't be suitable for everyone. Shame about those piles of stones that seems to be the fashion these days for visitors to make- what happened to 'leave only",
          "As ever on Skye, everything is narrowed down to single track roads with passing places, so first of all you need to take care driving there, and drivers... the views are to die for, so don't even think about it, or you will! The road to the lighthouse deteriorates even more",
          "The scenery is stunning and worth a visit I will admit I never walked to the light house as its one hell of a walk but even just to admire the view its worth it.",

          "Amazing view. It is worth a visit. The road is narrow and mostly single track. Check the weather before you visit. Make sure it is a nice clear day. it is a big no no if foggy. You won't see a thing and the road is dangerous.",
          "Was here a few times on my trip to Skye both for a walk and with my camera, got some loverly sunset shots worth a visit",
          "We visited during October and there were quite a few people there...but we hear it's chaos during the summer. Nice views and a good place to see seals and dolphins....though the lighthouse could do with a lick of paint!",

          "Great views and the walk to the top of the point is well worth the view. Take your binoculars out around the lighthouse to watch the feeding birds",
          "The wind was blowing so strong I kept losing my balance!! There's a path to the lighthouse, but my favorite view was from the tip of the hill close to the car park (the view in the picture).",
          "Did not manage to visit this part of the island during a previous visit. So, this time around it was very much on the list. Always been attracted to its Westerly position on the island and its outlook over the Minch towards the Hebrides. As we drove along the road, could see",

          "What a fantastic place. We decided to hike through the muddy land above the lighthouse to get pictures of the whole point. Easy hiking but wet and muddy - when you least expect it. I want to go back to hike out to the lighthouse and I want to go at sunset. Another reason to",
          "This lighthouse is not to be missed if you are in the area. We caught it on a blustery rainy day with winds on the bluff about 40 knots...so bring your warm hooded jacket and good hiking shoes. Its a bit of a walk all the way out to the light house but well worth it. On a",
          "It was quite wet when we visited but that made it even more atmospheric. The lighthouse was really pretty but a steep walk. Make sure you have good footwear, especially when it's wet as it is a steep decent.",
          "Sunset at Neist Point Lighthouse on the southwest tip took our breath away when we walked there\u00b4in Lars von Trier's wave noise. Be prepared that the single track narrow road with passing places is more narrow than ever. It really worth going there but it could be a little bit",
          "If you are into hiking and love lighthouses, this place is an excellent choice when visiting the Isle of Skye. the drive is beautiful, but challenging at times; and the views spectacular. the day we went, the overcast/rain weather didn't dampen our enthusiasm, and we hiked out",
          "The drive is along one way roads with lay bys. Plenty of parking. Long, steep trail back to light house. You will be winded. Worth the hike for the fabulous views! Very windy. There are very dangerous areas with no fencing near the cliffs. I would be very cautious with children",
          "Spectacular views, very steep walk...not for the faint hearted! We didn't walk all the way to the lighthouse as it was a beautiful backdrop to the sunset. I wouldn't fancy walking back up the path when the sun disappears completely so we walked back up before that happened",
          "Recommended to see this, roads were very rough and towards end no more than a track, car park small, no facilities. The walk down is not good pretty steep and I'm sure in wet weather could be slippery, a lot of rubbish and broken machinery laying at side of track, towards the",

          "We visited Neist Point on a recent trip to Scotland and it has an outstanding view. We did not walk out to actual lighthouse as it is a rigorous, steep walk although it appeared there is a good path. The cliffs are magnificent and I am certain that sunsets are beautiful.",

          "it started dripping when we arrived. by the time we left it was raining with a lot of wind. the view was a bit blocked because of low hanging clouds but still the view was worth the walk up and down the steps. parking is a bit limited. the tower is in good shape and had just",
          "Yes the lighthouse is in a poor state and there aren't any tourist facilities but the Point is a rugged place with great view's and walks and coves to explore around the Point. But if you are looking for tourist amenities it may not suit. We did stopped a Lephin Cafe on the way",
          "This walk is not for the feint hearted and represents the typical Highland contrast of breath taking scenery with non existent facilities. Parking is very restricted, the last 2 miles of road barely lives up to the name and the final cattle grid is a disaster waiting to happen.",
          "Long way along a windy single lane road.The views at the end were well worth the drive. Good path, but very steep in places. We couldn't believe the mess at the lighthouse however. it was just awful after all the well cared places we had seen in the rest of Scotland. It was",
          "As everyone else has said, the mainly single track road to get here is a little hairy, however once you arrive the scenery is stunning. We didn't go too far down the track as what we could see from the car park (as per others reviews) was photogenic enough!",
          "Set in one of the most dramatic landscapes in the UK, Neist Point lighthouse rightly attracts huge numbers of visitors. With a long, undulating drive on largely single track road, it's not the easiest of places to get to, but seemed worth the trip from first impressions. The",
          "Basically anything one does on Skye is simply the best at least in my humble opinion. This wasn't a long stop for us but we did hike down (and up) and it's a gorgeous view for sure. The cliffs are pretty unreal. Be ready for some intense wind and wear a toque though!",

          "First of all...the drive is long. And a little sketchy at times, as it is mostly 1 lane roads. But once we arrived, it was worth it for the views. Be prepared for the wind. The day I went, they were gale force. I was knocked down by the wind at one point. Thankfully it was",
          "Neist Point is the most westerly point on Skye. The view is spectacular especially on a clear day. It is a popular tourist site and can be busy especially during the summer months. Wear sturdy walking shoes - the walk is invigorating. We enjoyed the visit and will come back",
          "My husband and I decided to go all the way to the lighthouse which is quite a steep ascend on the way back. The lighthouse itself was nothing special to me personally, but the way there is well worth the sore muscles. It was very windy when we visited so I was a bit squeemish",

          "The views from each point of the walk was simply amazing. Lovely little beach down at the bottom too. The buildings around the lighthouse were a bit of a dump with broken glass and empty alcohol bottles. But the views made up for it.",
          "Thrilled to visit Neist Point! Finally reached the car park and after a short walk came face to face with a steep cliff! Yes there is a handrail, which is on the outside edge of the stairs/walkway but if you are dubious about heights and also have high winds to cope with, you",
          "After seeing this and the famous Old Man of Storr, I can definitely attest that this is more worth it. There is a lower risk of weather ruining your experience and it\u2019s an easier target to reach. If you go all the way to the lighthouse (which isn\u2019t really necessary in order to",
          "So, Neist Point was also a 'maybe' on our list. We had some time left at the end our time on Skye and made the trek out. First, this is THE craziest road I've driven on, and I had been all over Skye by this point. Was the drive fun. YES. We finally got to Neist Point, however",
          "Driving to Neist Point is challenging as it is along a one track road with passing places however, the scenery along the way is beautiful & when you get to the destination it is absolutely breathtaking. On a clear day you get a lovely view of North Uist, Benbecula & South Uist.",

          "The drive to the lighthouse is slow going along a single lane road with passing places. Although it was too windy for us to walk down to the lighthouse, we didn't regret the trip since the countryside and viewpoints along the way were beautiful.",
          "The drive there and back is quite demanding, particularly if you are not used to driving in the countryside. Lots of narrow roads with passing places, blind corners, steep drops and of course the occasional Highland Cow on the road!! But it is definitely worth the trip,",

          "The road up is horrid ... just before the car park there is lots of pot-holes. So be careful. Unfortunately we arrived on a day that was absolutely pouring with heavy winds ... it was a task to even open the car door never mind walking near the sheer drop. We managed to go",
          "The lighthouse, meh. But the views, stunning. It's quite a steep hike to get they're, and remember you've got to come back, but well worth it. It is a bit off the beaten path, but who's complaining with the beautiful scenery along the way.",
          "Long road there but really worth it as lovely scenery on route and at Neist Point. Parking was very difficult and no public toilets as seems quite usual for Skye. Lovely view from the carpark and as walk down to the light house and from lighthouse. Quite a difficult climb back",

          "The Neist Point is a really nice place to visit. You can walk down to the lighthouse and make some amazing photos on the way. This place also gives you the ability to make some great photos from the top. It is a really beautiful place which also gives you the chance to spot some",
          "It must be a fantastic walk when the weather is good. We did it in the mist and rain. The lighthouse itself is all locked up and deserted with many parts of it in a bit of a state. If you are planning the trip to visit the lighthouse then don't bother because you will be",

          "The view from near the parking lot is pretty decent, but if you're up to climbing the stairs down (and back), it gets even better. There's a railing most of the way and most of the stairs aren't too difficult (unless they're slippery from rain). There are lots of midges though.",
          "A hike to the lighthouse - it's not for the feint of heart. There is a fairly well-maintained path - fairly even footing for those that are mobility challenged - but you need to be in good shape to make it the entire way. The drive there is a bit harrowing though - mostly one",
          "We're visiting Skye at the end of August, thinking we would have good weather - think again! Neist Point is beautiful but we didn't venture out to do the hike because the wind was something else - blustery and very cold. It was also raining. The car park / parking lot is",

          "A beautiful hike even on a not so sunny day. Recommend going down all the way to the water, as you get to enjoy the area from different viewpoints. Very picturesque. The hike itself is not difficult - going back would be a bit steep, but not too bad",
          "Great view at the lighthouse. Some distance to walk (15-20 minutes) from the carpark to the lighthouse. But you will not regret when you have reached the lighthouse.",
          "It is a magic place. It takes a while to reach it with a tiny bu wonderful road. But then the sea touch the sky and you feel as you are back to the origins \nI would have loved to stay more but even few minutes make sense",
          "Beautiful scenerio but only go on a clear bright day, otherwise you won't see anything. it is a tiring walk and not suitable for people with mobility issues. There are no toilet facilities so make sure you \"go\" before you go",
          "Beautiful place -no facilities -single track road. Please take your rubbish home! I saw a leatherback turtle here  and Minke whales in August  so keep our sea clean!",
          "Worth visiting! Great view! It can get very windy!",
          "Amazing view on the coast and cliff.\nA 30 min hike will bring you to the lighthouse.\nThe walk is not difficult but it goes up and down with high height difference.",
          "Fabulous landmark to visit and the views are simply breathtaking, on the way to the lighthouse and once you arrive there. \n\nIt's easy to park a short distance from the foot path, just know that it will take around 25-30 mins of walking to \u2026",
          "Amazing scenery! If you've not been to this place you have not experienced Scotland. It's absolutely amazing - I wish I could go there every weekend!",
          "A MUST if you are by there. Will NOT be disappointed.",
          "STUNNING!!! If you're on the isle of Skye and it's non-cloudy, VISIT",
          "Brilliant attraction. Visited end of November. The walk down can be a bit steep but it\u2019s definitely worth it to see the lighthouse up close. It was a long drive but you won\u2019t be disappointed",
          "Very adventurous way there, but the greatest spot, I have seen. We had luck that the sun was shining in the evening and the next day. Good for doing a lot of walks on the hill at the opposite or around the lighthouse itsself.",
          "This place is totally worth it you\u2019re willing to make the hike. It is just s beautiful sight to see and hard to find anywhere else.",
          "A must if you are visiting the Isle of Skye. Unique landscape if you are lucky enough to find a sunny-ish day",
          "A fabulous place where its good to plonk yourself down somewhere with a bit of breeze (to keep the midges down), look out to the Hebrides and just be for a while. I stood looking out for a good 45 minutes and didn't regret a second of it. I \u2026",
          "single track road gets crowded given the popularity, so just drive slow around corners and pull over properly and you'll be treated to beautiful views and landscapes. went at sunset but it was cloudy.",
          "Wonderful views! It was quite windy and misty when we were there, so dress accordingly. There was also a steep staircase down. Glad we were encouraged to visit!",
          "After a nice walk you reach the lighthouse, you cannot enter so view is a bit limited",
          "Great short walk to see breath-taking views and a cool lighthouse\nIts a bit a shame that there are no signs that explain the history of the plcae and how it came to be other than a few short words",
          "A beautiful day out on the Isle of the Skye, walking and taking in the beautiful views with amazing air. The walk from the top down to the lighthouse isn't too difficult and suitable for most.",
          "Not sure if it is a must see place but quite interesting for a small walk. Very, very windy as you can expect.",
          "We got are stairs in today!! Steep up and down parts, so take your time if it is wet out. Luckily there was no rain today. Spectacular views allover the place.",
          "Must visit spot in Isle of Skye. It was a unique experience visiting this corner",
          "Stunning. One of the most beautiful places I've ever been to and made me want to go back to the Isle of Skye.",
          "A great walk and explore for a morning or afternoon. The place gets relatively packed so be down earlyish to get a parking spot.\nThere is an okay cafe building which sells good enough food, but I would recommend to bring your own.\nSunsets \u2026",
          "Excellent short hike and an incredible work out due to steepness. Lighthouse is all locked up but still a great little walk. You can see over to the Outer Hebrides islands on a clear day.",
          "Wonderful scenery all around. Glorious at sunset. Patience & care needed on the single track road. There are plenty of passing places.",
          "Definitely worth the .7 mile trek down to the lighthouse from the car lot. A bit steep in some sections but I think a vast majority of people can make the jaunt down. Sheep are in no shortage and happy to pose for photographs. The \u2026",
          "Such a gorgeous view! We came here to watch the sunset and it was so romantic:)",
          "Unique place, get along hike getting down to the lighthouse.",
          "Beautiful photo opportunity. The best picture spot is on the hill to the right of the parking lot as you look at the light house.",
          "Nice view, lots of parking space, just drive in.",
          "Its definitly wort of visiting it in sunny or normal  weather. Would definitly not recommended in foggy and windy time. Also the road to there is an \"unique\" driving experience \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
          "The view was absolutely stunning and breathtaking. We are lucky that the day was a sunny day with the sunset and all the stuffs (still windy but it is Scotland). Just be careful with every step you take because it might be a bit muddy and \u2026",
          "Awesome vista from the top of the cliff. Quite a steep walk to get the lighthouse but well worth it!",
          "Great little walk from the car park. Well maintained path but steep in places. The lighthouse is a delight from every angle but the cliffs are what amazed us the most.\n\nAs a bonus, build a little rock man just past the lighthouse, great fun for kids and adults alike!",
          "Fantastic place for visiting. The Lighthouse is most recognised lantern in Scotland. Very recommended.",
          "Very nice place. Hike for an 30min one way. Windy, and suoer windy.",
          "I wish I could give more stars but when I visited this place, it wasn't as pretty as the one in pictures. For a start, I didn't even get to actually get off my car because the wind was too strong I literally feared for my life. It was also \u2026",
          "The place is beautiful, the tower is beautiful from a distance, but close up ist looks derelick and ugly.",
          "Very pretty and you can see some wildlife off the shore, saw Harbour Porpoise",
          "Fabulous views.  Very nice place.  Recommended",
          "The road is a bit narrow and busy, but be patient, it's awesome",
          "At the time of writing this has been the busiest Summer on Skye and the increase in volume of traffic has caused problems on the narrow single track access road from Dunvegan. I would think twice about trying to drive here in peak season \u2026",
          "Amazing! The views are something else! Good long walk there and back.",
          "Go to this place during sun set and this place will not disappoint you. Make sure you wrap up warm might be very windy.",
          "Beautiful walk down and if you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll see a great sunset!",
          "Absolutely stunning views and a breathtaking walk",
          "A bit dissapointing driving an hour from portree. the lighthouse is not as nice as the pictures you see on the internet and there was sheep poop everywhere on the trail. be warned if it is raining or wet it will be quite challenging walking back up the trail. very steep. i would say pass on this one not worth the long drive.",
          "Fabulous location with stunning views. You can see the fog horn on the side facing the sea. People have taken to stacking stones, which is a bit eerie. Apparently the small cable car was for carrying sheep.",
          "Cool light house with incredible landscape views. Warning: there are no bathrooms and it is a bit of a hike once you get there.",
          "Though it can be crowded and have that touristy feel, the setting is still spectacular. There is a steep staircase that takes you from the parking lot to the point itself, where you can wander around the lighthouse, inspect the old fog horn, and gaze out at the Outer Hebrides.",
          "Beautiful viewpoint with easy access from road - approximately 20mn walking",
          "The road is nice for a place this far out. Parking was free in October and the view can be reached with a few steps. Going down to the lighthouse is also worth it, just as going for sunset if it's nice weather. Only annoyance are some of \u2026",
          "Fantastic view, steep path and steps but worth the walk. Best view from headland about 250m up from car park",
          "If you're visiting the Isle of Skye make sure you make your way to the western most point of the island. If the weather cooperates you'll be rewarded with amazing views of the coast & the lighthouse from afar. You can't get into the \u2026",
          "What a breathtaking place! A must for anyone traveling to the isle of Skye....",
          "The drive to get there was quite tight but worth it.Walk to lighthouse invigorating.",
          "One of my favourite fishing marks and place to be in Scotland. So much so that I named by daughter Skye.",
          "Quite a walk to get to the lighthouse but 100% worth it. We were lucky enough to be almost the only one (winter time) so we had that amazing view all to ourselves (along with a couple of sheep of course!) Absolutely stunning.",
          "Warning the road to get here is a single lane for quite a while, go slow and let others pass if need be. Here you can see some wildlife (seals, diving birds) make sure to bring water and use the toilets before heading out",
          "30-40 mins walk to the lighthouse, scenic views, make sure it is not raining",
          "Great views and interesting drive to get here. Parking once you're here can be a bit difficult as it wasn't designed to have so many visitors.  It's a bit of a walk down then back up to actually get to the lighthouse itself, but well worth \u2026",
          "The view is nice, but to get there is a single file road for 30 min. Also it's long walk.",
          "Beautiful place. Only downside is the hike. However, the view is amazing. :)",
          "A very nice trail, not too long",
          "Best place in Skye to visit definitely, even on a rainy day!",
          "beautiful views across to the outer islands, little bit of a walk, especially for me, but beautiful , especially when the sunsets, only negative there is no place to go to the toilet, however there is a giftshop not far that lets you use there toilet in upper miloviag",
          "Truly stunning views. From the road st the top it\u2019s about a 15 minute walk down to the lighthouse - you can\u2019t see it from the road but it\u2019s there! The path down is very steep - it\u2019s graded with steps but be prepared for it. Once you get to \u2026",
          "Most amazing views of Scotland are here. It's a MUST place to visit in Scotland. Getting there is not easy as the roads are very small, but the time spent to get there is totally worthy. Walk to the top of one of the cliffs and you will not \u2026",
          "Spectacular scenery and a successful day catching Pollock off the rocks",
          "Amazing view. In a fog and clouds, with loads of stairs, but it's worth to walk all that way. No access with prams, no toilets, no bins, no benches. Should be more amazing on clear day.\nThere was loads sheep poo on footpath",
          "Beautiful scenary and lighthouse",
          "Proper nice place with amazing view, but the traffic and roads are awefull, \nWhen we were leaving the traffic broke down on the single file road and we were stuck for 1 houre",
          "amazing place, one of my highlights in Scotland!",
          "A MUST see!!  The lighthouse is amazing but the surrounding area is stunning!!",
          "Nice place to camp and to be at sunset/sunrise! A small shop with some beverages and normal food is open till 7 o\u2019clock.  \nThe Neist Point Lighthouse is best seen from the cliff. Just walk up and not down to a perfect spot for your photo :)",
          "Amaizing place. Really beatiful.",
          "Very cool lighthouse! Prep for savage up hills though! Very much worth it!",
          "Challenging one lane road but beautiful views of Scottish lanscape/seascapes.",
          "Really spectacular view. A must if you come to Isle of Skye",
          "Great little hike (20mins) from the car park to the lighthouse. A bit steep from time to time. Worth doing a loop around the lighthouse and peeking into the windows. Also, walking down to the jetty with the rusty red crane is nice. The views all around are lovely.",
          "Nice, but it was rainy so the visibility wasn't so clear. Better to couch suny day",
          "This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen! Without a doubt the most beautiful scenery to watch a sunset. The way the sun casts it's last light upon the lighthouse and the cliff on which it stands is just incredible. I've \u2026",
          "Well worth the effort to visit the land that time forgot, but be prepared for that wind",
          "Good for the views and the fish. Worth the walk",
          "Got there just before sunset on a beautiful clear day. Amazing view. Made the journey from southern  United States worth every minute. Beautiful country and people!",
          "Beautiful dramatic views of the Scottish coastline! We arrived later in the evening which I was happy for, because of the low crowds. We were able to take it all in and enjoys our visit. The road to get in was a single lane for quite a \u2026",
          "Epic scenery and a nice, easy walk, but nothing really to do or see at the Lighthouse itself.",
          "Very nice lighthouse, lots of steep walking involved",
          "Neist Point was gorgeous! i could have spent all day here and still not felt satisfied. The hike down and up to the light house was fun and scenic. There's some other minor cliffs around which you can go up to as well.\n\nThere were tons of sheep in the area which sat peacefully while I clicked pictures.",
          "Excellent little walk (with a very steep slog back up to the car park). Lighthouse is located on a beautiful and remote end of the island. Can get extremely busy so I would suggest either getting their very early or even better going there \u2026",
          "Breathtaking views.  Love visiting here.  There are unfortunately no toilets available for the public though.",
          "Gorgeous even in the atmospheric wind and rain. Not too strenuous or long for even casual walkers, but those with strength or balance issues may take longer on the path. Scenic views of the coast and ocean.",
          "The ride through some of the most beautiful scenery on Skye is in its own self well worthy of the journey. When you arrive at Neist Point be prepared for an energetic walk, which is well worth the effort. Make sure you go the second climb \u2026",
          "Nice landscape but not organised",
          "Absolutely stunning views! Very windy and would recommend boots. Very lovely",
          "Awesome visit.  Fabulous absolutely fabulous",
          "Beautiful and worth the hike.  We went around 10 pm and it was light out until around midnight in early June.",
          "Amazing place to catch a sunset hike! The lighthouse is neat enough, but the landscape an views surrounding it make this worth while. It's a short hike, but steep. Be sure to check out the slopes and shoreline below the lighthouse",
          "One of the best viewpoint in Scotland Highland!",
          "One of most touristic places on Isle of Skye but the road and the views are worth it.\n\nThe best views are close to the parking place. Don\u2019t go down, walk forward from the end of parking place as long as you can see the lighthouse (the walk is only couple of hundred meters and majority of people skip this one)",
          "Amazing place for sunset",
          "Great view and you must walk down to it and walk round the peninsula, go of the path. Saw seals sunbathing away from the crowd. Well worth visiting. Parking pretty tight at peak times.",
          "After you have braved the long, windy, one lane road to reach the beginning of the trail, prepare for some amazing views! The trail down then up then down to get to the lighthouse was a little worse than it looked, especially with the insane wind, but it was still very enjoyable.",
          "Amazing view of a lighthouse from top. Incredible place, got there just in time for winter sunrise and it was worth 10hr drive!",
          "Great sight. Could be a heavy walk for some people because of the steep path back to the car park but when you're fit you can easily climb some other cliffs in the neighborhood that offer great views on the lighthouse and its surroundings.",
          "If you manage to make it on a good day expect great views! Careful driving up here, the roads not great.",
          "Stunning spot to watch sunset, well worth the walk",
          "The views are amazing! Make sure you wear shoes with good support and grip. You want to climb up to the peak right in front of the lighthouse for the best view! We went at what would be a reasonably busy time and we didn\u2019t have any trouble getting parking",
          "Gorgeous scenery,but it you're planning to visit the lighthouse then a certain amount of fitness will be required..beautiful place..",
          "OMG. Wow. The view is amazing. You must be fairly fit to walk the path (which can be treacherous in bad weather) to get to the lighthouse itself. Also, wear good walking shoes, take waterproofs and some warm clothes (as the weather can \u2026",
          "Great views good fishing",
          "Perfect place to see the sunset, do not miss out on this!!! There is a nice walk to the light house and to a small hill where the views are spectacular. \nIt is also a good place for wild camping if you are up for it, a few sheep around... But there are plenty of flat grass surfaces.\nThere is also a cafe next to the carpark.",
          "As always , a really beautiful time spent at Neist Point. Not only the fantastic views of the lighthouse but also the birdlife and the bays and cliffs. The roads leading to it have been partially repaired/resurfaced so a bit less hazardous \u2026",
          "Stunning location with a breathtaking view.",
          "Very pretty at sunset. Was exceptionally busy. The drive up was intense which kinda made the journey",
          "A very nice small hike to the lighthouse with nice landscapes all around.",
          "Beautiful views, breathtaking cliff leading up. Parking area very adequate relative to others on Skye. The walk is well paved but you'll break a little sweat. Only disappointing part was no access to the lighthouse itself.",
          "Nice spot for sunset, two long climbs to get back to the car park",
          "If you want a Land's End kind of experience, come to Neist point. You have to be willing to walk the mile from the parking spot to the lighthouse, and you will enjoy it more if you are prepared to be a little adventurous. In the Summer \u2026",
          "A good and fun day out. Our two year old enjoyed going up the stairs. We were lucky to go on a sunny day. Not too windy. The view was great.",
          "Very crowded but wonderful place",
          "What a place! A must visit for anyone wanting a beautiful view and if brave enough to walk up to the highest point for a big buzz!!  Take the extra 5mins to walk past the car park to get a glimpse of the cliff edge and lighthouse.",
          "Beautiful views with waterfalls going into the ocean. The path down to the lighthouse is steep so wear shoes with some grip because you'll also need to take that steep trail back up to the car park.",
          "Worth it. Super strong winds and gruesome climb, but worth it.",
          "Stunning views, especially during sunset. The walk is very simple so it really is for everyone. There might be a problem with parking, but generally you should find a spot. Definitely worth the ride! :)",
          "The lighthouse itself is an easy 30 minutes walk from the car park through staggering Scottish landscape, that is - at least in January - more exciting than the lighthouse itself.",
          "Easy hike down to lighthouse.",
          "the lighthouse itself is not very pretty imo but i love the surrounding view.. travelers with young children have to make sure they are up for it....",
          "A lovely walk with dramatic scenery. Good paths and hand rails. The lighthouse looked great.  All newly painted. Quite sad to see the disused buildings that used to be occupied by the lighthouse workers. Really pleased we visited. Went along the cliffs when we got back to the car park to see the lighthouse from a distance.",
          "This place totally surprised me. Delightful place . Parking free.",
          "You need to make the journey and see this outstanding area of natural beauty",
          "Great view, lots of stairs but the buildings around the tower are run down, without access, broken windows and no standard facilities such as a public lavatory. Since it's a long walk some public lavatories would be greatly appreciated. Skye is becoming very popular so some basic investment are necessary. ",
          "Brilliant for a western sunset.",
          "Beautiful scenery is out of this world.",
          "Lovely views on a good day. Worth swinging by if close. Walk is short (maybe 2 miles) but quite steep at points. My partner who has mild serable palsy found it challenging but achievable.",
          "Absolutely stunning. Come at sunset and enjoy the view. Wind can be intense up here so come with a nice jacket. Quite muddy too so don't wear your white designer shoes. :)",
          "Nice view and Nice walk around the Light house",
          "We didnt take the path to the lighthouse, but  the walk up the hill to the right of it gives you a stunning view!",
          "Best view with walkable to the top",
          "Short walk (20 minutes) and beautiful scenery. Lovely sunset spot. Good for the whole family.",
          "Stunning location. Bring good footwear the walk down to the lighthouse may be beautiful but my word is it steep!",
          "Amazing views and hike to get out to the Lighthouse. Be aware that there are steep paths throughout but definitely worth the climb.",
          "Quite scenic but driving to the place isn't easy due to narrow roads and steep slopes near to the place. Getting to the light house is again a long walk with slopes and you need to be very careful.",
          "Extremely beautiful view of the Scottish coast.   There is a looong descending staircase down to the bottom from which you will then walk 1 km before you get to an upward slope on your way to the top of the neist point.  Parking space is limited.",
          "A brilliant point to visit in Skye, especially if you like lighthouses! With only a short walk you can head right down to the lighthouse. I would advise taking a right before heading down the steps and head along the cliff for about 200 metres and you should be met with a brilliant view as my pictures indicate.",
          "Great walk and views are amazing.  Its a longish 2 mile walk so perhaps not for young kids, my 8 year old coped fine but found the steep steps very hard.",
          "Even in rain and foggy it\u2019s a beautiful place",
          "Awesome views.",
          "The best thing we did in Isle of Skye..loved it. The views are beyond spectacular..walk is not very difficult and there is a side railing for most of the way.",
          "Interesting walk around this little headland which on clear days give great views out to sea. It's worth heading up the hill to the top of the point beyond the footpath to catch the best panoramic views over the lighthouse and surrounding cliff line.",
          "Absolutely beautiful views, love this place",
          "Stunning scenery and amazing walk.",
          "A TRIP IN THE HEART OF ADVENTURE... Astonishing landscape! When we got there, the wind was really strong. Quite a lot of steps to get to the lighthouse. You should also be careful if you have children with you. Never leave them unattended \u2026",
          "We got the weather and the views are just the best. Parents log young children beware as there are a number of cliff edges, dramatic views but definitely keep your eye on the youngsters. The lighthouse is now automated so not accessible as \u2026",
          "Well folks I didn\u2019t expect the really steep walk down then up then down to lighthouse. Once there it\u2019s nice enough but there are nicer ones round Scotland. However the scenery that surrounds the lighthouse is spectacular and although we had \u2026",
          "An amazing place but rather sad and mysterious. Very crowded at Easter with a chaotic parking situation in the cramped space. One car ended up in a ditch.\nFantastic walk done to the lighthouse with spectacular views of the cliffs.\nThe \u2026",
          "Nothing there only a light house some good walks but some steep climbs",
          "Really nice views, the weather really helped",
          "Loved the walk and the views, but the lighthouse itself seems to have closed down.",
          "Amazing views and landscape.",
          "The lighthouse itself isn\u2019t the best but the walk and the views are spectacular. It\u2019s a 15 min walk to the lighthouse and starts with steep steps. Must-see if you\u2019re on Skye.",
          "Amazing view ...roads are narrow but in the end it was worth the travel",
          "What a place - incredible",
          "Fantastic views and beautiful sunset! We were the only people there when we went, as it was cold and the end of the day. It's pretty spooky, the lighthouse is abandoned. Stunning views, dramatic cliffs. A must!",
          "The lighthouse is nice but the best is the view you can have walking a bit on a small mountain just before it. Not for everyone. If you suffer of mountain heights better to avoid!",
          "great distance away from Portree, but many people come here, it\u2019s a popular destination on Skye isle, the view is quite depends on the weather,.",
          "Was there with a mobilehome and walked down as one on the first in the morning when we were the only ones there. You can stay there at the end of the street over night. Fantastic!",
          "Unbelievable  scenery.  Stunning views. Hilly  but well worth the walk.",
          "We arrived around golden hour (an hour or so before sunset). It was raining all day so I believe that was one of the reasons why there was no one else around. The only people we saw were a couple who actually made the hike down.\n\nI was \u2026",
          "Very good location with great views",
          "Wonderful but dangerous with dogs or children",
          "Amazing place and very nice view",
          "We didn't make it to this place. When we were 3 kilometers away, a storm came up and we had to go back. Anyway, we could see the landscape and enjoy the atmosphere of this wonderful region.",

          "Visited during Easter holiday. Weather was way better than expected. With nice weather, the place is  stunning! Highly recommend to visit for the sunset view. The road to there is not perfect but noy too bad as well. Best pictures are all \u2026",
          "Beautiful and wild in the wind. Go down to the Lighthouse and around it, on the rocks, left (South) of the lighthouse. Take care on slippery rocks and especially with strong winds - a drop of 50ft in the sea!!!",

          "Go for sunrise or sunset",
          "One of the main landmarks of Skye and if you are here why not give this short climb a try? It's nothing too strenuous but it does get tiring with the stairs, but as you know the views at Skye is phenomenal and the whole walk is going to be breathtaking",
          "This place is really Scotland, HEAVY on-shore winds with sleet, low clouds wrapping around the face of the cliff at times. Shooting with an umbrella sideways to keep the rain off my camera and the camera steady as well as holding it down, \u2026",
          "This is a great place for views of the coast, the sea and the Outer Hebrides. The lighthouse is abandoned but makes for a great photo motive. The walk from the car park is short but strenuous, esp. on the way back up. There is also not a lot of parking space.",

          "Great place to visit with brilliant views and a good spot to see the island",
          "READ ME!  This lighthouse is in the middle of nowhere on the worst roads I've traveled in Scotland. The parking is horrendous and there's still a fair hike when you've finally arrived (if you made it that far!).  Given the unpredictable \u2026",
          "Stunning place. It is the most westerly part of Uk. You\u2019ve to walk a bit to reach the place. It\u2019s worth every step. Every beat and every breath to reach this pace. It was super windy and raining the day I went.",
          "Well worth the single track drive and long walk",

          "Definitely a must go if you are chasing for the sunset in Skye. The lighthouse itself does not really offer much as a tourist attraction but the mesmerising sunset views on the cliffs overlooking the sea makes it worth the visit. Try not to \u2026",

          "A lovely place to visit in the evening when the sun\u2019s setting.",
          "Of course, the view is spectacular and that alone worth the visit. What is really a shame is that the lighthouse itself is dilapidated and turn into dump featuring everything that was ever moved down to the place. This is a disgrace and not easy to understand as it is one of the most popular tourist destinations on Skye. ",

          "It sure is a lighthouse. You can't go in it, and can hardly go around it. You can see it from a couple hills.  the path to it is steep uphill both ways, which means it's a steep walk down too.  Lots of sheep poo on the path too. Plenty of parking. ",

          "Long walk but worth it.",
          "One of the most beautiful and remote parts of Skey. It is not the lighthouse itself that is beautiful, but the entire scenery, and the tranquility when walking to the coast, away from where most people walk around. Even spotted a northern gannet.",

          "Very steep climb to get down to the lighthouse itself but totally safe and worth the trip. Roads are pretty good all the way to niest but can imagine in the summer it could get quite dangerious on the small single track due to numbers as \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Quiraing (Scottish Gaelic: A' Chuith-Raing) is a landslip on the eastern face of Meall na Suiramach, the northernmost summit of the Trotternish on the Isle of Skye, Scotland. The whole of the Trotternish Ridge escarpment was formed by a great series of landslips; the Quiraing is the only part of the slip still moving \u2013 the road at its base, near Flodigarry, requires repairs each year. \nParts of the distinctive landscape have earned particular names.  The Needle is a jagged 120-foot-high (37 m) landmark pinnacle, a remnant of landslipping. Northwest of it is The Table, a flat grassy area slipped down from the summit plateau, with vistas of the Torridon Hills and the mountains of Wester Ross.

          "The view from the top is phenomenal and not to be missed, particularly in good weather. The craggy green promontories, the road twisting through the valley, and the bright blue sea beyond form a breathtaking view which is hard to take in and try to remember for ever, however",
          "This is an amazing place to hike, you could hike all day and not see everything to want to. Make sure to wear good hiking boots or shoes. It starts out at a slow incline with a stoned path, but quickly progresses to a very rocky and uneven one. We were lucky the day we chose",
          "Stunning views even on a wet and windy winters day. Definitely get out to Quiraing to see it\u2019s beauty.",
          "Absolutely worth the visit. A fantastic drive up the hill from Uig. The views to either direction are stunning and the snow just added to the atmosphere. \u00a35 to park seemed a little odd and I can say we saw people clearly not paying it.",
          "Wow the views were incredible.... Nothing clears my head like the hills.... If you have a spare few hours get yourself up and have a explore",
          "A must visit - incredible, breathtaking location. Mind the hairpin bends on the way up but it is worth it. The views are astounding and far reaching. There is a little car park at the back and a walk can be undertaken. Even in bad weather it is an amazing sight.",
          "We travelled across the Quirang from east to west on our way to Uig. The main pictures you may have seen on the internet were taken near the beginning of the road on the eastern side. There is a pretty good sized parking area where you can get off an take pictures. There is",
          "We visited Skye in July 2019. The weather can be variable so you want to seize the good days and visit the Quiraing then. It's so worth going past the look out and traveling along the paths. We parked on the side of the road like everyone else and were happy that we got a",
          "Was part of a group trip to the Quiraing mountain range. What a breathtaking view, just another gorgeous area on the Isle of Skye.",
          "The road up is a little scary. Very narrow with few pull offs. We only had enough time to enjoy the view point. It was beautiful!",
          "Amazingly beautiful views for even short walks. Good parking lot. Only unfortunate aspect is the over-crowding. So what else is new?",
          "I have a panoramic shot of the Quiraing that I really like. It captures the light and green of the scene. What an incredible view! Highly recommended!",
          "Has to be one of the best walks ever With amazing views over to islands And beyond. Also around the old man of storr Had some realy wild weather But that just added to the beauty of the place. Done this walk a few times now Look forward to going back Bryce graham",
          "A beautiful drive from Portree along the sea with lovely views. At Quraing view point the wind was very powerful, my 14 year daughterhad difficulty keeping her balance. But the views from there were amazing, there is a medium difficulty hike as well but the wind did not let us",
          "Don't miss this hike! and plan on staying for 3+ hours. Truly on of the best hikes that you want to take your time exploring.",
          "Had a hard time locating trailhead and believe we may have tried to tackle it from the wrong direction. Our 5 year old brought her A game that day when we made it pretty far. Typical Scottish fog hurt our view but still beautiful.",
          "Located not far from Kilt Rock (10min drive) with plenty of parking and free-entry, Quiraing is another must-visit on Skye. With just a short hike from the parking bays, the views were incredible. One could hike for a whole day as there were plenty of trails. Wear proper shoes",
          "Despite the fact that you can drive right up the most scenic spot of the area, this doesn't diminish its beauty, though the ease of access also means crowds during peak season. Serendipitously the day I went it was horrendously windy so there was hardly anyone. My skirt didn't",
          "We walked the entire loop and had 2 short but heavy rainfalls. It was wet but a wonderful adventure.",

          "We hiked this beautiful spot on a recent trip to Scotland! Our entire family was there staying at the Sligachan for our son\u2019s wedding. Each day we chose a hike that we all could do together even a six year old. The Quiraing did not disappoint but rather filled us with awe each",

          "Lovely walk nice scenery and dramatic rock formations.Very muddy and rocky with some strong wind gusts which you have got to be careful of.Not that busy and the path goes all the way along the top of the cliffs which I suggest you do not do on a windy day so you just head the",
          "Let me first start by saying we've done a considerable amount of hiking, worldwide even. This is definitely one of my favorites. I felt like I just couldn't get enough of the beauty....something about this place is just so magical. We were lucky to be hiking on a fairly clear",
          "We drove over the one track road to the Quiraing. The heather grew alongside the road and up the hillsides. It was so beautiful. When we got to the Quiraing Car Park, it began to rain. However we walked out the path quite a way. It was so breathtaking. Words cannot express",
          "If you are on Skye and like hiking and amasing views then this is a must do. The loop hike takes about 4 hours and is reasonably strenuous. In October it was pretty muddy, so Hiking boots are strongly recommended. And... It is so worth it!",

          "This place is just magical. We got there around 7am long before the crowds. There were only a couple of locals walking their dogs that were on the track. It\u2019s a relatively easy hike up, and stopping to look back behind you was just stunning. After a couple of hours it was time",
          "Drive up the unclassified road to the car park. This is a thrill in itself. The car park gets very busy so go as early as you can, or I guess as late, especially in high season. From there there are exhilarating walks along narrow paths, not recommended for unfit people or those",
          "Lovely views, good walk (out and back). Clears the lungs and heightens the spirits. The drive is aw-inspiring. Parking may be a problem.",
          "Very nice location for a good hike! Make sure you wear good shoes! The views from up there are amazing!",
          "We simply drove through this area and enjoyed the views. No need to stop and deal with parking if you aren't planning on hiking. It still feels beautiful and majestic.",
          "The Quiraing was stunningly beautiful. The walks are great without being too challenging. But beware of parking. The car park can get very full. Best advice is either to go out of season or early / late in the day.",
          "We recently were in Scotland and toured the Isle of Skye stopping at the Quiraing. It is a steep drive to the top, with lots of tourists. But the views and landscapes were so beautiful!",
          "but then so does everybody else in the world. The views from here are magnificent; the walk is a single track path that is much worn down due to toooooo many people. Parking is awkward.",
          "Even if people have limited mobility they will be able to enjoy amazing views. If you park and cross the load and follow the track for approx 10 mins there's even better views to be had., Even folk you are not too fit and have limited mobility will be able to manage this",
          "Another part of Skye which we marvelled at the view. An absolutely stunning vista was on show. Just sad that there were other tourists up there like us!",
          "This was my favorite hike of my trip. Stunning views. You really feel like your walking into the Skye. We did the complete loop and I actually think it would have been more fun to go up to the view point and hike back down in the same direction. The backside of the hill back",
          "Such a beautiful hike, take extra layers and maybe even a touqe as the wind can be brisk. Make sure that you follow the people path and not a sheep trail as it can add extra time :) There was mud and water in places so do wear proper boots or shoes, this is not a hike for crocs",
          "This area has appeared in many films an TV series, and when you see the view you can understand why. The area is easily reached, there\u2019s a pay car park and a short walk to reach a viewpoint with stunning views (weather permitting) You can walk further if you\u2019ve got the kit for",
          "Yes, there is a single track road to get through the Quiraing from Uig to Staffin. Yes, it gets busy. Yes, the cemetery parking lot is closed now (locals told us of some disgraceful behavior there, so very understandable) and people do park in the road. BUT...if you get there",
          "Worth the ascend on a sunny day. Isle of Sky is known to have sudden weather change, so please make sure you are well prepared. Lots of boggy patches and you may have to leave the marked track to progress. It is a grade 3 walk, so walking sticks are highly recommended. View from",
          "Plan at least a half day or more to take in the beauty of this place. We spent about 2 hours there and needed much more. The hiking is easy and views breathtaking.",
          "This is a very experience? ! The scenery is unreal, stark and so beautiful you want to take photos all the time. The round-trip is easy as long as you have good shoes and are a good walker. What was more challenging was going up to the green plateau amidst the black rocks.",
          "Hands down the most spectacular views I've ever seen! This is truely an otherworldly place. I felt like we were heading into Mordor! I had no idea the scope of the place until we started hiking and let me say that as breathtaking beautiful as it was it was also quite",
          "Only got to spend 30 minutes there but could have spent an entire afternoon walking around, the beauty there!",
          "Amazing views and lovely hiking. So amazing! Can be a little tricky wending a vehicle around traffic on the narrow road. Be prepared for wind/ weather that can change on a dime and scenes to take your breath away. So lucky to spend time here. Highly recommend! Do use the",
          "Stopped at the car park to do a bit of a walk and stumbled upon a wedding out at the base of the mountain. Beautiful to watch with a solo bag pike playing off to the side. Impressive mountains to view with many trails to wander into. Amazing to be that close to the mountain",
          "Great spot to do some hiking if youve got the time. Very windy spot so be sure to dress warmly and be prepared for rain. A fair amount of parking available and lovely views if you just wanted to do a quick stop. There is a coffee stand near the parking lot as well for",
          "It's a beautiful hike, incredible scenery. Not very difficult, just a couple of passages. The hardest part is the road to get there by car. The parking can be full in summer and the surroundings can be crowded with people, but once you start the route, is nice and quiet. It's",
          "Our guidebook said that a visit on Skye was not complete withou visiting Quiraing and it was right. It is the most beautiful landscape I have ever seen, and each step you take gives you a different view",
          "This attraction is very unique. You can drive right to it, park for free and explore its unbounded beauty. If it is raining, then wait and the skies will eventually clear (if not, only momentarily) and you will get a glimpse of one of the most wonderful views and structures",
          "This walk was challenging, gorgeous, scary, exhilarating, and simply stunning. And that was just in the first half hour! We started in the rain, with no view of the ocean, and most of the mountain shrouded in mist. Even so, everything around us was stunning. But as we hiked (we",
          "Surprised how many people were up first thing in the morning, great views, interesting walk, and its all about the view, well worth the effort",
          "So it was 20 years and 9 months ago when I carried my then 3 month old daughter Skye to the Quiraing and there was no-one else around. How things have changed. There is now a rather large chargeable car park to cope with the huge campervans, tour buses even thought the access",
          "An amazing view, we were lucky to take it all in with pretty good weather, highly recommended! We almost didn\u2019t try as the mist was quite low but glad we took the risk, give it a shot if there is any doubt you may be able to see!",
          "How do I describe such a place, I have never seen anywhere so beautiful. Seeing the Quiraing was like going back in time. Unspoilt hills and scenery with lovely views. There was a small car park on the top.",
          "We were here for birdwatching, but couldn't possibly ignore the breathtaking scenery. Even with rain, wind and fog, this place is unforgettable. The driver will need to concentrate, as the road is one lane with passing places, busy, and has some 6\" dropoffs on the edge of the",
          "Absolutely glorious views and fantastic walk. If you get a clear day head straight here as you'd miss out on a misty one.",
          "My partner and I did a two hour round hike along the Quiraing, the scenery is beautiful and the walk was not difficult - we aren\u2019t avid hikers by any means! The car park is pay and display but takes card payment which is handy. \u00a33 for 3 hour or \u00a36 for 6 hours. We walked as far",
          "This is one of those \"must see\" places if you can possibly handle the hike. The view from the top is second to none. Oh my goodness. If you happen to hit one of those rare breaks in the mist you can see for miles. Our question: How do sheep hang around on such steep slopes",
          "We used the Walk the Highlands website instructions for our hike and it was perfect. It described exactly where to turn and climb over the two fences. The landscape is breathtaking like you stepped into the prehistoric times. The first 20 minutes of the hike is busy with a lot",
          "We didn't go very far beyond the car park but the Quiraing was breathtaking! So beautiful and absolutely worth a trip! The views are just what you are dreaming Isle of Skye would be. Will not disappoint!",
          "We came as it was a highly recommended place. We were not disappointed. I was sorry that the day we came it rained all the time but we still got to see the beauty of the place. I would love to return again on a sunny day",
          "We were very much looking forward to seeing the Quiraing - but alas, due to the absolute sheer number of tourists and cars driving - and parking! - badly, the road was impossible to get up. Would highly suggest NOT going in August; Skye really has become a victim of it\u2019s own",
          "I want to make my own trip back to Scotland just to go to Isle of Skye and hike. Spend some time camping and being in this nature.",
          "This was our very first trip to Scotland and Isle of Skye - and it was everything we hoped for as a traveller. We started walking and hiked for some time. The scenery became more and more beautiful. It\u2019s not a hard hike - but bring some water, as it\u2019s a little far. (Well, you",
          "If you have time to do only one challenging walk on the Isle of Skye, this is the one. The views from start to finish are breath-taking. My 10-year-old daughter and I are novice hikers, so this was no easy hike for us, but it was so worth the effort. We had to contend with an",
          "Our favorite hike on Skye with amazing views and awe inspiring sites along the way. Easy to moderate hike with lots of greenery, crazy landscape features and sheep galore. Wasn\u2019t that crowded and got a bit wet with foggy/rainy weather but that just added to the experience.",
          "Best views in Skye are from this spot! Parking can get busy at the top , but a larger parking lot underway. Take your camera, though a video may be the better option. It can get windy,and sunny as you are in the open. It's like being on the edge of the world! There actually",
          "Back after 20 years and the difference is scary. You will need to queue to park and may need to queue to pass each other on the narrow path in. However it is still amazing to see.",
          "The Quiraing is a stunning place to visit while on the Isle of Skye. I have climbed every time I have been, which is about 7 times. The scenery once at the top is breathtaking. Take a flask and just sit and admire the view and the sound of silence.",
          "amazing hike, stunning views. well worth a visit despite the lack of parking. Beautiful scenery. One of the many places on Skye that has to be seen to really appreciate it beauty.",
          "I'm sure if the weather is with you it's a great hike. Unfortunately, we came in on a rainy day so the view could have been better, and there were way too many bogs. For an inexperienced hiker, I'd advise to do this hike with clear weather.",
          "This is a truly wonderful location, scenery to die for. But some advice: - get there early or late and avoid the crowds - be prepared for people camping just yards for the car park - be prepared for there to be a lot of litter (take it home with you!) - I\u2019ve never seen so",
          "This was at the top of our places to visit and hike while on Isle of Skye. We arrived on Skye in the middle of a summer storm and were frankly not optimistic about getting our hike I the next day. The morning broke clear, sunny and bright so we got an early start to the",
          "Moderate to good physical ability. Not for those who hate heights. Hiking boots a must. Awesome views.",
          "The experience you get from that trip is simply stunning with great views and some (more or less) demanding passages. We has a lot of fun during our trip",
          "Is a cloudy day with intermittent rain, but the view is catching our breath all the way from strat till return. We taking the loop from the bottom track and retrun at the top of the hill. Is two differrent experience as hike throgh the bottom track, you have the view of the",
          "Most beautiful wiews. Worth the effort. We walked the loop path. Dont hesitate and do it. Very muddy be sure you have good hiking shoes.",
          "We found a nice place for a couple of tents for our family of 5, set them up around dusk, and left early morning next day. IT was beautiful, worth the stop, and was lovely seeing all the sheep wander by. From the open door on our tent we could even see the Ocean.",
          "The road way out here is narrow but turn outs for passing exist. This is worth a stop as the views are wonderful.",
          "We did the full 6 mile loop. They suggested to allow 4 hours and that's about what it took. This was on a clear day, so if it's rainy, expect a little longer. Wear STURDY boots and take the rain gear and plenty of water. You'll be rewarded with breath-taking views, fresh-air and",
          "Breathtaking views over mountains, lochs and the Atlantic sea. Possibly the best viewpoint in Skye. There are multiple hills to climb and paths to follow to reach great spots for amazing photos.",
          "Unbelievable views and one of the highlights of the entire trip. While the entire island of Skye is one of my favorite spots in Scotland, the Quiraing was STUNNING. The views are breathtaking. To be fair, we went on a beautiful day and it might not hold the same appeal in the",
          "Very disappointing, crazy bikers/car drivers putting everyone\u2019s life at risk- no patrolling,no speed camera! Never doing it again and do not recommend to anyone! Disappointed with over rated beauty as the place was a mess made by the overflow of tourism!!!",
          "This is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. The hike from the small car park to the end was great. It was not a difficult hike but if you are afraid of heights you may have some trouble in few places.",
          "Beautiful scenery with stunning panoramic view. A short walk will take you to the many pinnacles. A word of advice, the car park can get very busy at times. Best best to visit would be early morning or late afternoon.",
          "We drove this single lane adventure up to the pass, along with a ton of other folks, including small tour vans. Very difficult to find any parking at the top, so we just turned around and drove back down. Even from the car we still enjoyed the lovely views, with sheep roaming",
          "Beautiful but raining. When we got to the Quiraing to hike it was pouring rain! We found a place to park and sat for about 20 minutes and waited. It did clear up enough to get out for a few photos but not enough to hike. After we made it down the road the sun came out and gave",
          "Very foggy day, missed out on views but the burger van lady at the top was lovely. Good priced food and drinks.",
          "Fabulous walk with great views but make sure you have the right footwear & clothing for the Scottish weather",
          "Magnificent views of the sea links lands below. Hikes are available at the top pass area. Seeing the village area near the sea brought visions of Norse invasions.",
          "Just wow - you have to see it! Stunning views and landscape! Absolutely worth seeing! You can walk through but be asure of the correct path you choose - it is a very spacious area!",
          "We were able to go see Quiraing on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon with clear blue skies (could see mainland Scotland!). So completely gorgeous! We were there with a tour group, so we couldn't hike much, but we definitely wandered a little and got a feel for this amazing place.",
          "Even better in person than in the photos and the photos can be quite awesome. This is a MUST SEE if you are on the Isle of Skye. Everyone seems to understand this as the tourists in June absolutely swarmed the place. Probably best to visit in the off season.",
          "Our seven year old was just old enough to climb up to the main path from below, this was the best way to avoid the crowds at the main car parking area. Amazing views from every angle and still feels wild and unique. Needs good walking boots and a clear day to do it justice.",
          "Getting here is very straight forward, I used the walkhighlands website for a starting point. Once you are here you can enjoy the view or continue along the path and complete the hill circuit. Views to die for in a totally mystical setting.",
          "As everyone else has said, the scenery is stunning. You can do the entire circuit (6.5km) with a moderate level of fitness - just walk slower and stop often to admire the view (or take photos!). Easy walk with plenty of up and down on obvious tracks on the way out, and a decent",
          "Then you should visit Quiraing. We had about 20 minutes on a tour, but I would have enjoyed a half day of walking here to peaks and cliffs and plateaus protected by towers of rock. Be prepared for bracing wind!",
          "I love hiking and have done so all across Europe and the States. This may be the best hike I\u2019ve ever done in terms of the ratio of ease to spectacular views. Just an incredibly pleasant walk that has an epic, postcard-worthy shot every 10 feet. Leave lots of time to take",
          "Stunningly stark and beautiful with views stretching far and wide. We went once in the morning, but it was raining and rather busy and crowded. Since we were staying nearby, we went again around 8 pm and I would say it was the highlight of our trip. Very quiet, long shadows",
          "Felt like a long way on a very hot day, a few tough bits but generally a straightforward walk to see some of the best views anywhere, especially if you are into geology",
          "We drove up the east coast of Skye to see the amazing view from the top, looking east. The last hairpin bend was steep but thankfully we didn\u2019t meet anything. New parking areas are being constructed at the flat bit in the top, which will make it easier to stop. We continued",
          "Amazing views. Lovely drive there through the countryside. Well worth it. We didn\u2019t have the right clothing to walk all the way up but definitely looks like it would be worth it. Even to just stay near the car park is still fantastic views",
          "Originally we planned to hike through the mountain from East to West, but had to rely on public transport, and couldn't find a bus back. So we took a guided tour, and honestly, it was worth every penny. We are from a rather flat country, therefore these magnificient mountains",
          "Spectacular vieuws, nice scenerie, just stunning. If you have plenty of time and like hiking, do the hike. I was jusy lazy enoigh and took a road up somewhere up the mountainrange and enjoyed the vieuw, like other (a lot) of tourist do. When you'r travel along the coast, you",
          "Beautiful and not too strenuous walk. Superb views. Slippery in places scrambling through small waterfalls. Car park gets busy!",
          "Anywhere else in the wold would have this a stand-out, but it is merely \"just\" yet another amazing geological feature of the amazing topography of Skye. Access into the heart requires some fitness but it can be appreciated from all round. Like most bits of Skye now it'll be",
          "Really a beautiful walk of about 5 miles if you do the full track. However de lower route is far more beautiful then go over the top. But really amazing but you have to come early to avoid the crowd.",
          "Visited in the pouring rain and howling gale but that didn't diminish it's special feel. A truly magnificent and haunting place. Like several easily accessible but magical places around Scotland the site will need careful tourist management - the road up is quite eroded and even",
          "It's true that it looks like something out of the Lord of the Rings. It's really a spectacular mountain and you can drive up to the best part of it. Not far past Duntulm Castle and the Single Track cafe the single track road will become a dual carriage road and shortly after",
          "Felt like we were on another planet, just a very cool and scenic place for hiking and enjoying the awesome scenery!",
          "Great hike with amazing views. You can go as far as you wish and explore connecting trails. Parking is difficult, but since you\u2019re there to walk, it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not nearby.",
          "Beautiful views! The walk is quite long but not too demanding, even for people with poor fitness. Take comfy shoes, though",
          "We went on a guided tour of the isle and this was one of the stops. The view was so spectacular that it brought tears to my eyes. Really do not miss this",
          "This was one of my favorite places in Skye and I hope I am placing its review in the right place. The plaque at the overlook area said: \u201c5 Cuith-Raing\u201d. We went in the evening after dinner and there were only a few other tourists at that time. The place was soo beautiful and",
          "Being a tourist myself I realise how this will sound but...there were just too many tourists!! There are amazing views here and an easy-to-follow path along the edge of a dramatic hillside, so I'm glad we went, but we were surrounded by other tourists the whole time and for that",
          "There is the tourist route through the main section or a longer and more rewarding circular route that takes you above the Quiraing so that you can look down on it. Both need walking boots and a bit of confidence in your footing though. Make sure you keep an eye on the weather",
          "Nice and beautiful place to visit. Can drive all the way to the view point and just walk abt 200 metres to enjoy wonderful scenery. Unforgetable one.a must to go if visit Skye of Isle (Portree)",
          "This is a beautiful hike that brings you right up and along a mountainside that offers incredible views of the very unique landscapes below. What can you say about this place to do it justice? Stunningly beautiful, you have never seen anything this awesome. One of the most",
          "There are plenty pf parking and lots of walks to choose from. We walked around the Quirang and it took us 2 hrs, please note the paths get really muddy and climbs can be steep. There are also a few steps over fences that are not very dog friendly. No facilities or cafe on site.",
          "A great view on original rock formations and on the sea. Many paths around, if you leave the tourist track you can even enjoy the views alone",
          "Some of the most breathtaking views in Scotland high above the Highlands. It will be cold and very windy but so worth it for these views!",
          "Second time we have been here for a lovely walk with great views and plenty of photo opportunities. A bit busier than the last time we were here, but we still managed to park relatively easily",
          "The views and scenery at Quiraing were awesome and well worth the trip. We were there early in the morning and the crowd was already building, so don't get there too late in the morning or you will have trouble parking.",
          "Fantastic views and you should not miss going here. There is a car park so you can do the full trail or as much as you want to before returning to the car.",
          "We stayed at Digg, Staffin close by to Quiraing Mountain and were over awed by the beauty of it. A bit of a hair raising drive to the top from the Staffin side but no worse than many of the other single track roads on Skye. Views from the track on the climb up were stunning in",
          "The scenery is beautiful. This trail is not too difficult with regards to elevation gain. However, the path is narrow with immediate drop-off beside it. No room for error. You have to scramble over rocks in some parts. In parts there are little rocks that make it very",
          "The scenery on the Quiraing starts right away and does not let up throughout. Some steep sections but don\u2019t miss this hike. If you only hike one place in Skye, do this one.",
          "We stopped by here on our way to Staffin and wow the views were amazing. We got out and had a look around. Would love to go without children and walk along the path.",
          "If you\u2019re on Skye don\u2019t miss this destination. Be prepared for tough hiking. The views are worth it though.",
          "It is well worth the drive up here on a clear day for the spectacular views. You can see right across the water to the mountains in Sutherland. Simply stunning and feels other-worldly!",
          "Well worth the drive up to the top. The views are simply stunning especially on a clear day. We were on a tour so did not walk for long but we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Would love to walk more if we go again.",
          "Well worth the drive to the top. we did only a short walk,but others were setting off for major hikes. The road up and parking were a bit of a challenge.",
          "During our 2 week trip to the UK we planned to visit the Isle of Skye for only one reason...to visit Quiraing, Fairy Glen, Fairy pools and hike Old Man Storr. We lucked out. The weather was crystal clear and the temps were perfect. The drive up to Quiraing parking lot was in",
          "Narrow trail moderate hike (with lots of other trail options for more challenging hikes). Absolutely breathtaking! The scenery was beyond gorgeous! We did have trouble finding any sort of trail map. I used my alltrails app to pick a trail.",
          "Ok....i am in decent shape, 62 with a new hip....this was a challenge for 2 reasons.... 1. It is a pretty long hike. i only did 5 miles of it and eventually turned around and back tracked. 2. It is a narrow, rocky path with steep terrain and no guardrails or trail markings.",
          "Drove through this area on a private tour of Skye. The rock formations, the coastline, and the landscapes are all beautiful.",
          "We went with a small bus tour. Probably the best way to get there (other than hike) as I wouldn't drive myself (not from Scotland so the roads are foreign to start with). Stunning view even on an overcast and drizzly day. Take the opportunity too look from the top and from the",
          "Drove up to the Quirang from Portree on narrow roads with passing places. Well worth a visit for the stunning views across the landscape.",
          "Worth the drive if you're at the Isle of Skye. It's a windy and narrow drive up (part of the adventure). But go slow, and at the top it's gorgeous. Was very cold and windy, but totally worth the drive.",
          "Loved the clean fresh air. Lovely scenery and had a good hike. There are some parking spots available at the side of the road. No toilets, so might want to drink less or use the toilet before heading over.",
          "Love the quirang. Scenery out of this world, great views to the south, Rassey and the mainland. Well worth a couple of hours of what is a gentle walk.",
          "Drive up is steep on a single track road. There were more than 100 cars up at the top. Crazy! Still worth the hassle. We walked out the trail a ways. Rough footing. Wear sturdy shoes.",
          "Excellent walk through a set of amazing views. Really unique and majestic. You could feel history in the air. Walking boots I think are essential. The path is slippy in places and there are some high spots where you would not want to be at risk.Some people had sticks which",
          "This is one of the best walks I\u2019ve ever done. The views were spectacular! Breathtaking views over the rest of Skye and over to the Outer Hebrides too.",
          "Amazing landscape and views. It\u2019s a bit of a trek to reach it by car but once you\u2019re there footpaths can take you 2 directions to the summits",
          "Amazing trail with views for miles. One of the most beautiful hikes I've ever taken. We spent two hours here and it just wasn't enough. Do not miss this on Skye!",
          "The Quiraing was one of the highlights of our trip. Absolutely beautiful and a very easy hike in. It does get crowded so go early.",
          "As everyone says, if your visiting Skye you have to visit this place, the views are breathtaking in any weather, except fog! Parking is free but chaotic as no actual allocated parking bays, stay to gravel and avoid very soft peaty edges unless you want to become part of",
          "Remains a transcendently beautiful place, despite Hollywood and the coach parties discovering it. Do yourself a favour and go out of season or when the coach tours aren't running.",
          "We were recommended to visit the Quiraing where we were staying and I am so glad we went as it was spectacular! As you travel North on the A855 you will get to the village of Brogaig. Turn left and follow the road up the hill. There are a few passing places along the road but",
          "The pictures say it all! Quiraing is everything you see in pictures and more. Stunning views, beautiful walks. This was the first stop on our \"tour\" around Isle of Skye. We didn't do the full hike as we only had one day, but I would recommend taking the time to do the hike.",
          "Came here last month. Thankfully got a fine clear day which made it truly memorable. The walk to the Prison was relatively easy apart from one dodgy bit and some loose scree areas.",
          "Tremendous scenery to be had here . We did the entire hike out and back , went slow , took about 3.5 hours . We saw golden Eagles soaring shortly after starting . Well worth while . A couple of pieces of advice - Get there early ! We were there shortly after 9 a.m. and there",
          "Stumbled across this by accident, so pleased we did though ! Only a fleeting visit, would love to come back and do more of the walk. We find it on a par with more famous geological formations",
          "Possibly the most amazing place in an amazing island, the Quiraing is just out of this word. Do yourself a favour and do the whole loop. It takes two to three hours and you'll be glad you did it.",
          "If you want a true picture of the Isle of Skye and Scotland in genereal, drive through this valley. You'll see lovely sheeps and smoothly shaped hills all over the place. The road is mostly single-lane but there are passing places all over the place.",
          "Truly amazing place. You will want to make photos from every perspective since each look better than the previous on. The loop is really a loop and not just a bounce back, start at viewpoint level and go on the crest on the way back, both views are amazing",
          "Used the \u201cWalking in the Highlands\u201d walk around the Quiraing which was 6.5km. Stunning walk, scenery & views. Couldn\u2019t stop taking photos. Definitely a walk to do when on Skye. Iconic location with unique scenery. Get there early to ensure parking space on road between Uig",
          "Tough hike if your out of shape. I took it slow and steady. The views along the way are amazing. Pack water and enjoy your time.",
          "We visited the Quiraing several times durning our stay on the Isle of Skye in April. The weather did not play nice but didn't spoil the trip. Will be returning when the weather is better.",
          "A totally magical place, well worth a visit. But crowds could detract from the experience... so earlier/later the better, I guess, if you're a photographer you'll be planning that anyway.",
          "Visitors of the Quiraing should expect a two hour walk (one way) in a quiet mountain area with a few small pools, some distinctive rock formations and fine vistas along the path. Most sections of the track are rather even and not very steep. The start of the track is poorly",
          "Such an easy place to reach - should be pretty accessible to most. You only really need step out the car and walk away from the car park and you will see the best of the Quiraing. There are walks to take but they do not improve on the initial and primary vista really.",
          "The road is challenging, but you can get great vistas not a 10-minute walk from the parking lot. It is a topography unlike anything I have seen. It looks so old you would not be surprised if a dinosaur passed by. If pressed for time, the first 30-45 minutes of walking gives",
          "We were lucky with the weather. Sunny and warm at Easter!! Great hiking, amazing views, well worth a visit.",
          "We were advised to arrive early (before the tour buses) and we did (around 8AM). If we could do earlier we would have seen an amazing sunrise! The car park is decent but can get really busy really quickly. There are 4 ways you can take in the scenery. Either you can drive",
          "The views here are stunning, whether you stay near to the road or venture further. We went right to the end and the return trip in total took 2 hours approximately. Views all the way were amazing and not too strenuous either. Big thumbs up. Parking is alright as you can park at",
          "Scotland = Nature. You can't say you have visited Skye without going to Quiraing! It's undoubtedly one of the best places to be to connect with Scotland. Take it from someone who has been there and left her heart there <3",
          "Such a gorgeous region to visit and take a hike - breathtaking and wonderful. The trail is a simple dirt path that leaves room for excitement, but elderly people should take precautions as some areas can be slippery. Your hike can be anywhere from 20min to 3 hours depending on",
          "Enjoyed this strenuous(in parts) walk today in bracing but pleasant weather. Walking boots and poles advised as it can get quite \u2018technical \u2018 in parts! Well worth it for the views across to the torridon mountains.",
          "The scenery is just stunning and epic - like something out of Jurassic Park. It\u2019s must for when visiting Skye. I\u2019m not a hiker but completed 6k round hike. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anyone with knee, back, hip problems or another physical condition that might make ascending",
          "The view from the car park alone makes the visit worthwhile, but go walking and it gets better. If you are only on Skye for a few hours, this should be your destination.",
          "This place is a wonder of natural beauty and shouldn't be missed, whatever the weather. Drive up to the top not for the faint hearted but well worth it. Plenty of parking spaces and a lovely place to walk/hike. Views are spectacular.",
          "A 6.8km round trip hike that took us 3 hours total. Well worth it! Spectacular views! Large car park near the start of the trail. Turn onto the one lane road at the Staffin Bay View lodge if coming from Staffin direction. Gets muddy in places so be prepared.",
          "Beautiful, stunning, beyond words. Must see for anyone visiting Scotland. We got lucky w weather. So many amazing places. Wow",
          "Even though it was a little bit misty and very windy, Quiraing was simply amazing. The views were spectacular. The drive up to the viewpoint added to the adventure.",
          "This landscape is well worth a visit. The hike is relatively easy with stunning and breath-taking views. When we went it was a foggy rainy day, but that didn't ruin our experience, it actually added to the ambience of the place. A must see!",
          "If you're in the area, you *must* visit this. Really beautiful - a highlight of our trip to Scotland and that's saying a lot. You can see quite a bit just by driving out, hiking 20 minutes out and heading back to your car, but I got the impression that there's a loop hike you",
          "I live in Glasgow and have seen quite a lot of Scotland and Highlands, but Quiraing is just something else. Every second I was questioning - is it Scotland? The hike here is quite easy - you don't have to go up much. Also, there is an easy path to follow, not very rocky,",
          "One of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen! A definite must if you're on the Isle of Skye. Not suggested if windy and don't follow the route on the Isle of Skye website (we couldn't understand it) but the views were incredible!",
          "very windy in March and it was a bit overcast so we didn't hike the trail, but could easily get to a viewpoint.",
          "Everyone who sees this place will remember it! Yes, this is a stunning landscape, and what most coming to the Isle of Skye region will drive/tour to see -- just breathtaking! Incredible example of land shifts, massive rock formations, views of the coast, and sheep grazing on",
          "Yes! Just go! If you love nature and scenic views, this is a must! I went during low season in February so no crowds. I\u00e4d try to get here early early, with first ligth, so that you get here before the tourist minivans. The road is narrow and a there is a lot of pot holes but",
          "Simply stunning. Worth taking a brief hike up the hills despite inclement weather. Great views of iconic landscape.",
          "This is a stunning location. A high vantage point without the need to climb as the carpark is on that level. There are walks that loop round and back or straight through to a lower location at Floddigary",
          "This is a great way to really savour the journey round the circular route from Uig to Portree via Staffin. The views are incredible but care must be taken with driving as there are lots of tourists who are not totally familiar with the protocol required on a road with passing",
          "The roads are narrow but there are a lot of passbys provided to allow oncoming traffic to pass easily. From the top the views are breathtaking.",
          "We stayed on skye for 2 nights. The is an amazing beautiful place. Well worth the visit. A little difficult to get to in bad weather.",
          "First, if you are a nervous driver and it is a busy day think twice. The road at the top of the pass can get VERY congested and create a need for lots of reversing etc. Whether you intend to walk into the rock face (good path but strong footwear advised) or just view from the",
          "Absolutely beautiful views from all directions and in any weather. The drive up to the top is easy to navigate and once there, the views can be admired by anyone - you don't need to have excellent fitness or climbing skills. The only downside is that there are no facilities at",
          "The Quiraing is a great walk- not too hard and the views are fabulous. It took me three and a half hours (and I am not a fast walker). You could add another half hour to that for walking to and from your car however, as there is very limited parking. It is a circular walk,",
          "Easily reachable from small car park and provides a beautiful view. No good when it\u2019s misty but if the weather is good the views are to die for. Stay away from the edges though as they are highly unstable.",
          "Drove to the Quiraing on a beautiful day. The roads were narrow, but easy to navigate. Great views and lovely scenery every where!",
          "Quiraing is one of the prettiest spots imaginable, full of stone outcroppings, surprising waterfalls, perfect vistas of seas and sky in all directions, with a path that leads on a circular trip through landscape both wild and impressive. It also features a somewhat harrowing",
          "The landscape is very rugged and wild, a steep winding road to the top with beautiful views everywhere you turn, you want be disappointed",
          "Very little parking, but once you get a spot, the hikes in the Quiraing can't be beat for out of this world views.",
          "We visited in January with limited time and it was snowing and cold so we wimped out and did not walk far. We did drive the single track road across from Uig and it was an amazing drive, particularly in the weather! We would love to come back again with more time and slightly",
          "By far our most memorable experience on the Isle of Skye. The scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The trail is not very steep and everywhere you look is stunning. The road to the trailhead was charmingly narrow but as long as you proceed with caution it is nothing to worry",
          "This has to be one of the most beautiful places on our planet! We spent an afternoon hiking here and oh, the beauty. Every step was a tad different and so beautiful, words can't describe. I highly recommend this, even if you don't hike. Drive up just to soak in the view.",
          "A landslip on the Trotternish peninsula. The name is from the Gaelic words for \"pillared enclosure\". That's what it is, but the soaring towers, pinnacles, and buttresses make for a wonderful hike, and if you're fortunate enough to have a very very clear day, you can see all",
          "We drove along the road to Quiraing, which is a very steep road (15%) but when we got part way along the road there was a car park where a number of cars were already parked. We got out and walked up the hill and when we looked back over the roadway the views were absolutely",
          "My husband said this was the most awesome hike of his life and I full heartedly agree! It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a Tolkien movie. So uniquely beautiful and really puts things in perspective on a spiritual level. The hike itself took us about 3 hours at a leisurely pace, take your time",
          "Views from this point are amazing! You can walk in the nature and having good time doing hiking. Place is very nice and it is an obligatory stop while you traveling in Isle of Skye.",
          "So we visited here but 100% cheated and didn't actually do the walk, we were running out of time, but we drove up for the view and its stunning, we did a little walk, and there is a refreshment van at the top so you can get drinks etc. If we had more time we would have happily",
          "Such an amazing place, so beautiful. A tough hike and worth it. Incredible views from the top. Don't walk too close to the edge, it has fallen off in some places. Stay safe and enjoy the views.",
          "Wonderful wild landscape, amazing scenery and well worth a visit. Great to stay nearby. Untouched beauty",
          "This hike is absolutely beautiful. We visited in September on a extremely windy day but this didn't deter us from going on the hike, it made for eery photos and a wonderful experience. The views are breathtaking. We preferred this hike over the Old man of the Storr.",
          "The landscape of the Quiraing is amazing, full of small lochs and streams with waterfalls. A truly fascinating trip on the Isle of Skye. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Skye.",
          "A very very beautiful place. We were lucky to have very few people visit Quiraing when we were there. The roads can be small and narrow but the view is the best reward. Extremely beautiful view of mountains, roads, and sea...one of my best memories:) views were like post card",
          "Visit this place, the path is easy and the view is breathtaking! It\u2019s for sure one of the best place to visit on Skye",
          "You don't have to hike to get an amazing view of the dramatic cliffs and the view to the sea as it's just a couple minute walk from the carpark you can get stunning views while watching the sun come up!",
          "yet another reason why Scotland is the most beautiful country in the world!! Really interesting and relatively easy walk with stunning panoramic views all round.",
          "We were there on a misty, cool morning and the surrounding country side took on an eerie, mystical feel. Well worth the drive.",
          "I understand the hypocrisy of a tourist complaining about tourists, but this isn't a complaint, just a warning. We thought we had missed the tourist season, but the vans and buses were still pulling up in September and dropping crowds of people off at this gorgeous hike. Most",
          "My first day driving around it was rainy and the rain and wind just got stronger throughout the day. I was disappointed that I couldn't make out any of the landmarks that I had come to the Isle of Skye to see. I knew that the weather was supposed to be better the next day so I",
          "What walks are for \u26f0\ufe0f\ud83c\udfde\ufe0f... Beautiful views on the walk on Isle of Skye, taking in the lovely Scottish greens and blues that outstretch.",
          "A stop one must make when in portree. Someday I\u2019m going to return and hike as I can\u2019t 8magine the view from above,",
          "If you make it to Isle of Skye, you should defiantly do this hike. You can make it what you want. a loop, an out an back. It really is up to you. The views are fantastic. It was a little windy and rainy when we went but we still had a beautiful hike. Enjoy.",
          "You simply mustn't miss this place if you visit Skye. It is just so beautiful, even on a wet day. Words cannot describe the views. Just go and look for yourself.",
          "Don't just park and snap a picture, take a walk down the path to get away from crowds and open up new vistas. Go early (sunrise and morning light is best and helps beat the crowds).",
          "Just awesome views, like something out of middle earth. The walk itself is relatively easy, though at some points it was necessary to step over waterfalls and ravines.",
          "A two hour walk from the top car park to The Table and back. Lovely clear day. Fantastic views , amazing natural structures. Totally unique. Path a bit muddy and a bit of a scramble in two short lengths. Would recommend stout walking shoes or boots for good grip and support. Not",
          "An amazing area for hiking. Fantastic landscape and views. The carpark is located at the highest part of the single track road 5.5miles from Uig or 2.5miles from Staffin. We took a 3 hour hike along the prison / needle and later on the table. The way down from the table was a",
          "However Skye or Scottish authorities wish to do this, the road across this beautiful and immensely popular beauty spot must be improved. I fully understand the need to protect the site from despoliation but the present road is a disgrace. Keep it the traditional single track",
          "We were there on a day of mixed rain and sun with low clouds, so I'm sure we missed some of these formations. Even so, it is a stunning alien landscape.",
          "Quiraing is even more beautiful than Old Man of Storr. It can be more lengthy hike as you can choose to go how far, but spectacular views are just one of a kind! There are spots on the path that are eroded or slippery with gravel and narrow, so caution is necessary. Again,",
          "While the roads in rather narrow to get there and the carpark grossly inadequate, I must say the place is a must visit while on the Isle of Skye. We visited in September so we missed the summer crowd and was able to get parking easily (it was still full). I cannot imagine how",
          "I didn't get to see the Quiraing in all its glory as it was a misty and windy day ,I was determined to go anyway as I had a limited amount of time on the Island. At least I didn't have to fight through the tourist masses and on return mine was the only car in the car park; a",
          "Our small tour van stopped here for a short stay. The wind was so fierce it was quite difficult to walk/hike. However, the views were absolutely spectacular - will take your breath away! The road leading up to it is quite a tough drive with the traffic, being single track,",
          "Walking the Quiraing was a highlight of our time on Skye. Extraordinary landscape and views to the Hebrides. The wind was really blowing at the top so just check the forecast before heading out.",
          "We climbed up for 1,5 h in a rather nice weather, but after a couple of rainy days; wearing good shoes is essential, because it can be very muddy and slippery. the scenery is really stunning, and each time you start taking pictures, you want to climb further to get a better",
          "As can be seen from the photos, it's a beautiful place. We visited in September and so glad we weren't there in summer as I would imagine things could be even worse on the roads and in the carparks. Like many places in Europe, being loved to death by tourists. So it wasn't",
          "My friend and I completed this hike the first week of October. It's a more remote trail head to get to and completely worth it. Get there by 9 am if you want decent parking and to avoid a lot of people. Also be sure to read the instructions on the hike ahead of time as there",
          "Really enjoyed this walk. The rock formations are magnificent with ever-changing skies and the blue sea as backdrops.",
          "Stunning views to be seen in this outstanding area of beauty. The views are reached by driving up a single track road which keeps climbing to reach the car parking area. It is well worth the trip. To make the most of the views ensure it is a clear day and make sure you take your",
          "This is a challenging walk. Our hotel map said 2.5 hours but it took us about 3.5 to walk the circuit. The views are amazing. The walk is not easy as it is on.a narrow ridge which can be muddy. If you walk for about 30 minutes all the tourists who stop every 10 seconds to take",
          "The views from here were absolutely stunning. We went around the whole circuit and were not disappointed. Some paths were narrow and slippery, the way back down was very boggy and wet sonwesr appropriate footwear.",
          "We traveled to Uig to visit the pottery and Skye brewery and decided to drive the Quiraing Pass to Staffin on the way back. The roads are pretty narrow with only single passing. They are also not in thybest condition with sharp twists and turns. The gradient, up and down is also",
          "Easy walk/hike to see one of the best landscapes in isle of Skye. The views are just breathtaking. By a sunny day, you will get extraordinary photos. Would recommend to get there early. Best for finding parking and less people. Just go!",
          "We couldn't do the whole walk but what we did was fantastic. The views are stunning. There's a long winding one lane road up to the car park so caution needs to be taken - not everyone seems to get that you need to show consideration for other drivers.",
          "A really nice trek, with moderate ascent and amazing views. Some places require crossing running water over stones.",
          "We rented a car and were just driving around the island. Had no idea of this hidden gem, and luckily offered to give someone a ride back to their car as they got lost hiking. Amazing views although quite narrow road. Had a hot dog at the top from the woman that runs the snack",
          "This was an acheivable walk with very rewarding views! It is a must see if you are travelling around Skye. There was a coffee cart/food stall at the bottom of the hill and olenty of car spaces. The walk only took 10-15 mins and it has stunning views wherever you pause to look on",
          "Well worth getting your hiking boots on and spend 2-3 hours exploring this magnificent scenery. Even if you're not up to hiking too much, park your car and take a short walk to some of the look out points and enjoy the dramatic views.",
          "A great walk along narrow paths with spectacular views all the way. Quite busy on a weekday in early October but not too bad - many people only go a short way along. Could be very different in peak season - the car park was full as it was by late morning. Could be challenging if",
          "This is an exceptionally beautiful area. If you do hike, bring all things waterproof (shoes, pants, backpack, coat) because it alternated between sun and hail for us. The lower path out was nice, but the upper road back (top of the ridge) wasn't obvious and it was very muddy and",
          "Leave the car and go walking in this amazing area of Skye. This is what the beauty od Skye is about. Once again small carpark so be early. This may test your fitness but is worth the effort. If not take your time driving and stop where you can to take in the beauty of the area",
          "We drove through the Quiraing and stopped a few times to take in the scenery. We didn't do any of the hikes but just took in the beautiful vistas. Once again it was a one lane track with areas throughout for passing. On a clear day I can imagine you can see forever and",
          "This walk is definitely an experience. It\u2019s not an easy climb as the path goes through all kinds of terrain...waterfalls, over rocks, up rock slides, puddles, mud etc. But what incredible views. Literally it takes your breath away. Not to be missed!",
          "weird and so very interesting, I'm old(er) and got some lovely shots from below. I leaving the climbing to the younger more energetic people",
          "We spent about 45 minutes walking part of the Quiraing range. It was cold with blustery winds, so we did not wander too far. Fantastic vistas. Not to be missed.",
          "It was a Five member Highland tour with Discover Scotland... My son and I joined the others and climbed up... The soil was wet and black... and the bone chilling wind was ready to blow us away.... but we enjoyed every moment spent at the Quiraing... and we clicked the most",
          "From Fairy Glen, we came here and arrived at 10 am. We found a parking spot in the parking area and there were already plenty of people. It was a beautiful day with a few clouds and blue sky. We came on Monday, September 24. The trail isn't that difficult - not too much",
          "First: If you drive up to the Quiraing parking place, take the road from Staffin. It is more impressing than the road from Uig. Second: The Quiraing is a little bit tricky to walk. It is not a \"sunny\" walk but a kind of walk in the alps. With climbing ups and downs, with rocky",
          "Awe inspiring! Mind blowing! Beautiful! Spiritual! Plan to spend 2 hours here. Hike is pretty easy with a couple of rocky spots to cross. After 8 days on Skye this was a favorite. Don't miss The Quiraing hike!",
          "This holiday just got better and better The weather was quite kind to us and the landscape was astounding Bit tricky drive up to the Quiraing but our experienced driver had no problem Worth the drive and muddy shoes to experience this amazing view",
          "Dramatic scenery with views over the island and out to the mainland. The only downside on the day we went was the volume of campervans and tourers that were clogging up the road. Definitely worth a visit though if weather permits.",
          "a bit overrun by tourists but there is room for all. take a tour vehicle there and save on the wear and tear of the mountain- get your camera out for stunning photos - you should not miss the view",
          "And it's a very BIG but... GET THERE EARLY! Or walk. The car park is probably the most inadequate in the world for a well-known location like this. There were horrifying photographs on various websites this summer, showing the narrow road with hairpin bends, clogged with cars",
          "We visited on a rainy day and the views weren't visible at all times. We still had a nice time, despite the weather. The path is easy to find and you can decide yourself how far you'd like to walk before turning back. On a clear day the views would be stunning and visible right",
          "Stunning views on the Trotternish Penisula at Quiraing,Isle of Skye.We stopped here as part of a tour day with Happy Tours.Wonderful scenery.Bring a raincoat and suitable walking shoes,as the weather here is very changeable!It was very windy and rainy when we stopped",
          "Be sure to include this in your travels around the Trotternish Peninsula. The views are beautiful. Yes, the drive there is on a 1-lane road, but the drive doesn\u2019t take that long and the views are gorgeous. Be sure to wear appropriate layers. It can be quite windy.",
          "We lucked out on a sunny day. The hiking is amazing and the views definitely worth the journey. It took my breath away",
          "This was yet another beautiful drive to a stunning location. We were disappointed to find that the best views required a substantial hike up to the top of the bluff - we should have done some checking before making no the drive. Still, the views we had were terrific.",
          "These rock formations are the \u201cdon\u2019t miss\u201d attraction on Skye. Unfortunately your experience is a bit weather dependent, particularly if you intend to hike up the hill.",
          "The Quirang offers any visitor to Skye a chance to enjoy the landscape at it's most rugged. The area has a number of trails keeping reasonably level to the area of parking just over the ridge edge. Some come and go within 15 minutes of arrival, getting in the main views....but",
          "After visiting the Old Man if Storr, it would seem logical to drive on as far as Quiraing which is not one spot but a whole expanse of land and hills and breathtaking views. Definite worth the very pleasant drive. Get out and take in the views and breathe in the fresh air!",
          "We went to the Quirang toward the end of the day to check it out. If the trails had been as steep as the Old Man of Storr we probably would not have gone very far as our legs were beat, but fortunately since the car park is rather high up, you also start the trail among the",
          "The Quiraing was the favorite hike of our trip! We would rate it as a DO NOT MISS hike! It is a bit of a climb to get to the top but SO WORTH the views! Hardest part of the whole hike was the trip down. Most reviews say it takes 2 hours to complete but it took us 4 hours. Start",
          "Tackled \u201cThe Quiraing\u201dtoday left early to catch the sunrise instead met with a stormy sky and slight drizzle with pretty good vis. Onwards we go...One and a half hours up the mountain and we feel the capricious nature of the scottish highland weather. In the clouds, heavy rain",
          "We did this on a clear day, without rain, and we are beginning hikers with an average fitness level. We easily made it and you can make it as hard as you want; you can only see the mountains (Prison & Needle), or you can go way up there and see the Tableau and a beautiful view",
          "Simply breathtaking! A must see whilst on s kye. Have a little climb up - the views are well worth it. Almost like another planet!",
          "No photos can do the area justice. You can make the walk as short or as long as you wish. The views are absolutely breathtaking. Take your time to stop and look around to enjoy the scenery. There was a bit of a challenge with parking the car but it wasn\u2019t impossible. It\u2019s",
          "Such a peaceful feeling going to this wonderful place. The only sound we heard was from the sheep on the mountains. The scenery is truly spectacular. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "My husband and I and our granddaughter spent several hours here, hiking, climbing and just soaking up the magnificent scenery. The place really does feel magical and otherworldly! One of our favorite places on Skye.",
          "This is simply awesome. We walked from the car park with our 11 and 9 year old and enjoyed amazing views, colours, joy, awe and wonder. Cannot be missed as it is simply amazing. Could have looked at the view for days.",
          "We didn\u2019t make it all the way up, but to the point we DID make it to, it was absolutely stunning. Skye is breathtaking!",
          "I can\u2019t stop thinking about this walk. It took just over 3 hours and we messed about a bit. It\u2019s stunning, more a walk than a climb. We went early and it was nice and quiet. The return was much quieter and the parking area was chaos. My advise, go early and enjoy all it has to",
          "Our trip in Quiraing was amazing. The scenery and views are simply stunning and we couldn't stop taking pictures. We walked around the whole place and enjoyed every second of it. Definitely do not miss when you're on Isle of Skye.",
          "A very amazing and awe inspiring landscape awaits you here. Put this on your bucket list and you will have no regrets.",
          "A visit to Quiraing was part of the 3 day tour of Isle of Skye. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking. We had a fabulous guide, who volunteered to take group pics of us on the mountain top.",
          "The rock formation of the Quiraing is amazing. In the North of the Isle of Skye this rock dominates the landscape and is very impressive.",
          "We started this hike with the intention of just walking out a quarter mile or so for some pictures, but we just did not want to stop! We were losing light by the time we passed the Needle, so we turned around there. Some of our party went back the next morning and completed the",
          "We did a number of hikes on Skye and this will go down as the best and most memorable. The views start almost immediately and don't stop for a few hours. We did the entire loop and while the path walking out was really clear, the path back up and over the ridge was much less",
          "WOW! The views of the most wonderful landscape were seen from this hike. We are from Alberta, Canada so use to hiking in the Rocky Mountains which are breathtaking but I have never seen the type of rocks and land formations that we say here, It was green and lush and peppered",
          "This was an absolutely breathtaking place to go for a hike. However, the path can be treacherous. I would recommend hiking sticks and shoes with a very strong grip (I wore regular sneakers and I wish I had brought my hiking boots) if you\u2019re going to do the full hike. Me and my",
          "The roads are very narrow and this is enough space for just one car at the time..... but it is so much worthy!!!!! Just park your car where you can see the other cars and take a walk. The trail is 4.5 miles, but I just walked 10 minutes from the car park and took the best",
          "This is a must visit ! The scenery is incredible - I can\u2019t think of any other place like this ! A word of warning - thousands of other people want to see this too, so at peak holiday times ( August ) go early or late in the day - as the single track road makes for chaotic",
          "Lots of people and cars and a bit difficult to get a parking space. One treck is long (did not do it) but probably gives a magnificent view. The other treck is shorter (just walked a short distance). The view from the starting points to the trecks is stunning in itself.",
          "Moderate difficulty walk with stunning views. Could not recommend highly enough. Would be difficult in winter but we went in August and got lucky with the weather MUST SEE MUST SEE",
          "Bautiful landscape. To see the best you should walk beyond most people. It's really beautiful on sunrise.",
          "Many people hike up to get a close view of the Quiraing, but there is a single track road from Uig to Staffin, and you get a wonderful view from this road. We did it about 7:30 after an early dinner, and the rocks looked fantastic in the setting sun.....all crumpled, folded and",
          "The best hike I did on the island of Skye. I would absolutely recommend it. Check the WalkHighlands website, \"Quiraing hill circuit\" for an accurate description of the walk. Sleep in Portree, wake up early, hike the Old Man in the morning and this one in the afternoon. It was",
          "This place was recommended to us, but we hadn't done much research so we were pleasantly surprised by the breathtaking beauty. There is a hike you can go along, not sure how far it goes, but we went 2 miles to the gate before turning back. It is really beautiful and has",

          "Wow! This place is stunning! The walk was not hard, but so very rewarding. Be prepared. We had pouring rain, wild winds, sunshine and fog all in our 2-hour walk. We were lucky enough that the rain ended and the clouds parted to reward us with spectacular views. A very",
          "Beautiful place but long walk uphill to reach the end. Otherwise unusual place well worth to visit. Try to be there in the morning so can park closer to the path, if you come in the busy time then expect to walk a bit longer. Still didn't figure out what's the difference",
          "Fantastic scenery but challenging to negotiate by road due to extensive park g on roadside and number/size of vehicles overloading the limited passing places. Would recommend parking further away and enjoying a longer walk in.",
          "Came here only a couple of hours after walking up the Old Man of Storr! We parked up to take photos from the viewing area (you'll see it, there will be many people taking photos there) and headed on up. We took a slightly different route, we walked passed the viewing area and",
          "A very nice walk with generally good well marked path. The day of our walk started with good weather. Unfortunately, the cloud closed in a bit later and at one stage the wind is so strong that it was like trying to walk in a wind tunnel. There are a couple of water crossing but",
          "quiraing is the best place i had even been to which beauty is out of my prescription It took two hours or more if you walk slowly And I sugguest that you should bring a raincoat with you and a pair of walkable shoes",
          "Although could be challenging for those not steady on their feet. Be sure to come equipped for rain and mud, especially suitable footwear. You are in the mountains here. Some lovely rock formations to admire and a loop to walk. There is fording of burns involved and some places",

          "If you ever have the pleasure of touring Scotland, and more importantly, the Isle of Skye, which is one of the most beautiful, natural places on earth.....take the time to find the Quiraing! We hiked in to the rock wall which was one hour in and then one hour back to the",

          "I\u2019d wanted to do the Quiraing for a couple of years. I seen pictures and read about it. Fantastic day out. Not as difficult as climbing a mountain, but you need to keep your wits about you in certain places where the path is very narrow. Very popular but not over crowded like",
          "The Quiraing is stunning and it's beautiful to walk the several kilometer route along it, from the unofficial car park over towards the port town on the other side of some of the peaks. It was very busy but this wasn't one of those places that seemed ruined by there being a lot",
          "This was my personal favorite of the four places that we visited in one day (The Old Man of Storr, Kilt Rock, here and Fairy Glen). The rugged views are stunning and almost supernatural. It\u2019s incredibly windy, even on a relatively good day, so don\u2019t expect to take selfies -",

          "Wow! Wow! Woow! This was a hike that\u2019ll be remembered forever! Okay, clouds and rain were present and it might limit some views but this was amazing! The hike we took to the bottom of the needle and prison was an hour - an hour and a half (depending on tempo and capability) and",
          "What can I say that the pictures don't? The geography is fascinating. The views are spectacular. It's easy to spend the better part of a day exploring the area. Note: we went late morning and the lot was full. The area is pretty big so it didn't feel totally overrun, but",
          "The landscape is absolutly stunning, even though if you don't walk along the hikes. the round walking trial is breathtaking, it takes about 4-5 hours. But you can walk a shorter trail and enjoy the views as well. Make sure to wear walking boots and wind and waterproof clothes.",
          "This drive is magical! So much to see and take in, one of the highlights of our trip to Skye. Well worth the visit",
          "Beautiful landscape wherever you go. If you like the highlands, this is your next must be. You see rock formations, sheep, green shades. Everything done in 2 or 3 hours. Take time, don't stop, take pictures and run. You miss the moment.",

          "isle of skye is so atmospheric, so out of this world. it feels like a peaceful jurassic park, the rolling greens of the hills are easy to hike, and everywhere the view is breathtaking. We stayed in a caravan in staffin, about 1.5 hour drive from the bridge where we entered skye,",
          "Such a nice hike/climb to do on Skye! Really enjoyed ourselves, not too hard of a climb (although there are some parts where there is a lot of instable/loose rocks), beautiful scenery. When we were halfway we decided to go to the cliff before making the turn up the mountain to",
          "Amazing. Photos don't do it justice. It's a quick hop from Uig and you can hit kilt rock and the old man of storr on the way back to portree. I did it WITHOUT enthusiastic hikers (rain), and still found the view amazing.",
          "Nice views but in my view a little overrated, but, it was apart of the tour. Had lots of rain which deterred my enjoyment.",
          "The Quiraing is the most stunning landscape I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s so immense, it\u2019s like looking out over the Grand Canyon for the first time and not knowing how to take it all in.",
          "Sorry, but we tried twice to find a car parking space - boy do they need to biuld a better car park! Couldn't even find a spot to take a picture. Crazy drivers trying to put cars where they shouldn't, hold ups, delays etc etc. Hugely impressive views, walking not easy - best",
          "Having spent a few days around Staffin my wife and I were able to visit some of the great natural wonders of this area. The most imposing of these being the Quiraing range which dominates the landscape. These are a couple of different tracks to take, the most common of these",
          "My husband and I walked up from Brogaig and followed the trail from the top all the way to Flodigary and back along the road to Brogaig. The walk to the top following the road was easy, only getting steep at the end. Once you get to the top you are rewarded with breath taking",
          "Stunning views, we did a circular walk - walking boots recommended, couple of steep scramble bits but not too scary. Gets busy with parking, but there is more in the lay-bys and also near the cemetery below. Windy up there - best to wear layers with a waterproof on top.",
          "Tremendous landscapes, dramatic vistas and an extremely fun single track road to drive along trying to avoid far too wide camper vans, far too fit cyclists and far too arrogant sheep who quite happily wander down the middle of the road and only move over when they\u2019re ready. A",
          "Beautiful! Absolutely worth a stop along the way. Breathtaking views for miles. Take a moment to take it all in.",
          "If there is one walk to do on the Isle of Skye I would choose this one! The loop will take you about 3-4 hours. It is pretty wet and technical so I would recommend good fitness and good waterproof shoes. Having a map of the hike is also recommended as there is no indication",
          "Definitely the most atmospheric place n Skye. Takw an early morning walk along from the car park at the top - careful at the gully. Recommend walking boots!",

          "Quiraing is one of the most beautiful places on this earth! The landscape is fantastic, dramatic and extremely beautiful. The views are stunning and you see many things that you can only see and experience in Quiraing. When you first see Quiraing and the view over the",
          "This place is brilliant but busy. To avoid the crowd simply walk a bit further along. Wild windswept and giving great views.",
          "We came on a very foggy day, but this did not take away from the sheer magic of the place, and our enjoyment! It was a difficult hike because of the weather, so would advise you check before setting out. Loved the walk, and the landscape was spectacular.",
          "Outstanding area for lovers of the outdoors, geologists and historians alike. The road from Staffin is also like a mini alpine pass. A good walk just remember this is Scotland and you may well get 4 seasons in one day so dress for it.",
          "This hike is worth it 100%. Right from the beginning, you get to experience views of a most spectacular valley with sheer cliffs and the ocean in the background. The hike itself is pretty easy, and although the trail is still one of the more popular things to do on the island,",
          "We stopped at the Quiraing on our Isle of Skye bus tour. We took \"Wow Scotland\" . We got out and walked the hills, was told history of and stories. Our bus driver even got out a ladder and clean the widows at one stop, so we could see better. Shout out to Sandy and Christian",
          "Outstanding fairytale landscape, but a word of warning about the level of fitness required to walk the path. The greatest \"landslip\" in the UK presents itself as something like a giant sea of waves frozen in rock. It defies description. BUT the path, that starts off quite gently",
          "The Quirang is a great place to visit while on a Trottenish Peninsula tour on Skye. Get up early, skip the Old Man of Storr if the parking is lot and road looks full. Keep heading up the Peninsula - have a nice lolly at Three Brothers and then head on up to the Quirang. If",

          "A nice hike up to some amazing rock formations. good views of the loch and skye. definitely worth the hike.",
          "Stunning beauty. Like most things in this area...getting there requires negotiating single.lane roads. There is little parking. It is beautiful and is free for all to see.",
          "Do not miss this while on Skye! If you have a clear day, it is well worth the bumpy drive to get here!",
          "This is a beautiful place to spend a few hours hiking. The views are guaranteed to take your breath away. The hiking trail can be a bit narrow at times and it can get very windy too. So caution is advised.",
          "Another beautiful part of Skye. Take good notes because all the distinct areas to view are hard to remember how they differ. Also be sure your battery on the phone is full!",
          "Haunting beautiful place to spend time. Wonderful views over valley from trail. Need to be in shape for this one. Car park is a nightmare though.",

          "Starting our day in Isle of Skye , reaches this place in the middle of the day and in very windy and wet weather, hence could explore it partially but still it was amazing .The slopes, greenery dotted with sheep grazing and staring at you is just awesome . I heard there are",

          "The scenery is positively extraterrestrial. Take your time, and enjoy the hike. I would classify this hike as strenuous.",
          "The area is just gorgeous, and we had a lovely day here. I thought I read enough about the hike to know where we were going and what we were looking for, but somehow we got muddled up, and it took a little extra long to make our way to the parking area. Once there, we did not",
          "This was a fun hike. We started right outside our house we rented and hiked for about 5 miles. There was always something new and amazing around the corner. Water pools, green mountains, Stone fences and breath taking moments",
          "This was one of the most beautiful places we saw on Skye. It was truly stunning. If you have time, park and take a long walk. We say many people hiking and wished we had had time to join them. Plan the extra time here, as the views in the glen must be astounding.",
          "Don\u2019t worry about single track roads, reading previous reviews I thought my wheels would just be on the road....the roads are fine, just drive carefully. Roads not designed for fast driving. Quiraing - we arrived about 10:00 hrs, perfect time..not many visitors. The track was",
          "We had to visit the Quiraing twice in the one day due to thick fog but it was absolutely worth it! It is very easy to get to and only a 5 minute walk from the car park. There was also a snack van at the top selling tea/coffee/snacks. The views from the top are absolutely",
          "A beautiful meadow and with Lovely sky It\u2019s one of the most wonderful places The truly spectacular Quiraing is an icon of Scotland. Many people visit only the first short section of path, but this complete hill circuit goes further, passing the Prison, Needle and other features",
          "What a treat... This must be one of the great drives of the world. Single track and steep so must be a good confident driver.",
          "The view from Quiraing was nothing short of breathtaking. After you arrive, you can climb up to see even more. We climbed a bit, but absolutely nothing strenuous in order take in the views. This was the highlight of my trip to the Isle of Skye. Go see it.",
          "So worth seeing, amazing vistas, exquisite scenery. Extremely windy on the day we were there, adding to the mystique.",
          "Took the local bus to Uig and circled back to Portree. Such an amazing island with stunning scenery.",
          "A moderate hike with absolutely beautiful views. A few areas require some scrambling and care, but we always felt safe. Wear hiking boots. Snack can at the car park provides some refreshments.",
          "I would recommend this place to go, if you have very less days to visit isle of Skye. View from here is spectacular if the weather is nice.",
          "Although the road to get here is a little harrowing, it is worth the effort. The hike and the views are worth it. This is a wonderful way to enjoy the Isle of Skye and the beauty of the area.",
          "It was a very cool hike that had some beautiful views. It had a lot of hard climbs but every step was worth the views! Our family really enjoyed this amazing walk and we really recommend you try it. The summit has a gorgeous view of a few islands and cliffs. There\u2019s some hard",
          "This was my favourite walk on Skye. It is fairly easy and the scenery is brilliant. It takes about 2 hours, but every few minutes the scenery changes. I returned the same way because it was dead windy that day and it did not look safe to return on the top of the mountain walk. I",
          "The drive to the Quiraing is an adventure in itself. Single track, switch back roads: but if you are willing to drive it, its worth the stress. The views are endless and the hiking is a backpackers dream. We did not hike up this time but hope to in the future. Take care",
          "Awesome place to walk and absolutely stunning. The trail isn\u2019t too difficult but walking boots definitely recommended! Be warned it\u2019s a single track road to get there and depending on which way you come from you could meet the local bus. The bus driver we met was very patient",

          "This was amazing! We have been fortunate to enjoy some great hikes over the years and this one ranks right up there with some of the best of all time. The views are astounding, and I agree with the others who say that pictures just can't do it justice. Good walking shoes are a",

          "A really nice walk, but tread carefully as it is easy to slip on the path if you,re not paying attention. Make sure also you are wearing appropriate footwear. Flip flops won,t do I,m afraid. The views are certainly worth the walk.",
          "Looking for a short hike on the Isle of Skye? Try the Quirang. You will be rewarded with great vistas of the sea, walk though mountain meadows dotted with sheep and descent into the groughs of the towers ringing the northern path of the walk. A wonderful way to spend an",

          "Amazing views especially if you get a sunny day in May like I had. Unforgettable beautiful vista's. It's a loop. I did not know that it takes 2 hours non stop to do the loop supposedly. I would wear sneakers or light hikers and bring water. Some people afraid of heights stopped",

          "Did the walk all the way to the pinnacle and past it round to a peak. Weather was outstanding and views just incredible. Definitely worth the visit and the wall",
          "Granted we had amazing weather for our scotland adventure but the hike was really enjoyable and the views are the best I have ever seen in the UK. If your considering a hike then I can't recommend this enough. Could be a bit sketchy in the wet as the full hike is steep and would",
          "This is breathtaking place to hike and view. We were here on a sunny day and the area was lush and green. There were a lot of folks enjoying the day here as well, but the area was big enough for us all. My warning of note are the roads to make it here. For those not familiar",
          "Stunning panorama. Well worth the visit. It's incredible in the sunlight. Parking was a complete nightmare, but you have to persevere, it's not something you want to miss.",

          "This is a really cool sight to see but beware of how crowded it is. We weren\u2019t able to stop because there was no way to park with all the people there. Still worth it to drive by and there are still more beautiful things to see on the road past it.",
          "Stunning views on a relatively easy walk/scramble lasted about 1 hour 40 minutes. The weather was superb the views even more spectacular. Drive up to parking area a little challenging.",
          "My husband and I visited here in early May. It was a very wet and windy morning! There is a car park which is free and it was fairly full, but most people just have a quick stop to look at the view and then go again, so spaces opened up pretty quickly. There are amazing views",

          "Wow doesn\u2019t even cut it. This hike was magical and spectacular. We did hit sun late in the day after driving in rain all day. The hike to the Quiraing ridge and around behind it and back took about 1.5 hours. Stunning views every second of the way. You share the hike with a",

          "The Quirang is an amazing place to visit though it must be said the car parking is somewhat haphazard! Worth the effort t get there however. Superb views and walks to suit most abilities but not for those less mobile. We were lucky to be there on a beautiful sunny day but I",
          "Words cannot describe this place, you just have to go. One of the most mind blowing vistas I have ever had the privilege to view. We had a clear cloudless April day and were blown away by the sheer beauty. Be prepared for car parking chaos, in April roads were very quiet in",
          "Saw the photos and put Quiraing at the top of our list. We traveled to it on the single track from west to east in a smaller Land Rover. It was cold and raining, just beautiful! Took many pictures and would have enjoyed hiking more if we had the time. Definitely deserves a",

          "You can definitely appreciate this range from the road, but we wanted to hike here. It was just difficult to find the right parking place and entrance to trails. There are trails; it's lovely on a sunny day. I wouldn't recommend it in the rain, as the trails were muddy even",
          "Leaving Uig and crossing the island towards Staffin we came to this scenic landscape which is just breathtaking. We had a sunny day to really set the stage for this awesome view. Although we did not do the hike into the terrain, the stop was worth it and highly recommended.",
          "Very busy at the time we went, August. But it's well worth it. Stunning views everywhere you look and a beautiful walk which is fairly flat with the occasional small waterfall to jump over. Golden Eagles in the area, one flew above our head which was an incredible sight.",

          "If there's one thing you definitely should do on Skye, it's this! Spectacular walk with breathtaking views on Skye. The whole walk is a bit long and can be a bit difficult some times, make you sure you're wearing good hiking shoes. It's definitely worth spending the whole day",

          "Great walk with amazing views. The track is quite small and not maintained too well. It follows along the base of a ridge. It took us about 1 hour 30 minutes to do the walk nice view to stop and have lunch at. There were plenty of people around on the walk when we went.",
          "2 ways to enjoy. A quick up the slope 100' yards to a nice photo opportunity. Or the 4 mile loop trail which can  be very slippery and had some steep edges, and slopes. Good shoes, poles are helpful and some pants you might not care about getting dirty. All in all a great half day or quick stop over.",
          "Really great walk, quite busy all the way up to the car park. Saw a few families but probably a little bit too challenging for the little ones. Also quite muddy and slippery when wet. One stream crossing so wear suitable shoes.",
          "This place is a must. It is an essential walk for any photographer as it passes though some of the most spectacular landscapes in Scotland.\nIt has been formed by a massive landslip which has created high cliffs, hidden plateaus and pinnacles of rock. Choose a clear day and bring your camera. You are going to love it.",
          "A stunning, unique landscape which probably has even more impact on the moody day I was there. The six mile circuit along the foot of the cliffs and back over the top is an easy walk, but the summit and descent get very boggy in wet \u2026",
          "This should be on everyone\u2019s list when visiting Skye. The trail has very atmospheric views the entire way with no dull moments. Very quiet and beautiful and only takes about 3-4 hours total depending on how far you want to walk it until you \u2026",
          "Fantastic scenery, a bit of exercise but not too much.  A memorable experience.",
          "Absolutely breath taking place to visit. If on the Isle Of Skye, this is a must visit!",
          "Beautiful walk. Stunning views.",
          "Very beautiful mountains and nice path (not always cleared marked) and a parking which you have to pay even if there is no toilets and no trash, a bit strange!",
          "I did the hike while it was raining and in very windy weather. The path underneath is a nice hike but the part where you climb to the top is not recommended in wet and windy conditions. It is very slippery and muddy. If you still want to do it bring good gear",
          "It is of course stunning but Social media may be to blame for it's popularity. When I first visited 10yr ago not a soul but now 10+ people were there as early as 0630.",
          "We woke up early so that we could catch sunrise at this place, it was magical. It was December but fortunately, it wasn't cloudy or too cold. It was so beautiful. Even if you didn't plan to hike all the way to the top, you could still enjoy \u2026",
          "Brilliant walk at the top of Trotternish. Took us just over 3 hours to do the loop. The scenery was amazing.",
          "Very nice, even a little rainy, and there's fog It is a little disappointing to reach the end and come across a thick fog that hides the ocean's landscape. I think the authority should mark the way back through the mountains and not the same way we did",
          "Took a late evening hike in the Quirang.  Stunning scenery and had the place nearly to ourselves!  We hit the trail at 8 pm and were back to the car by 10:30.  Still quite light out in early July.",
          "Absolutely beautiful place. The few mile trail loop bright some breathtaking views.",
          "Magnificent views. Worth going",
          "Amazing views with some hiking. Definitely recommend.",
          "A very good walk through the valley to the View Point at Fir Bhreugach, then back up over the top of the grassy ridge to the parking. Advise reasonable footwear, with some ankle support, and the wind could be cold up on the ridge.",
          "Walked the lower path. Fairly flat, and most people should have no problem. Outstanding views. Recommend going in the evening, great light and fewer people.",
          "A great hike with views like middle-earth",
          "Amazing views, nice easy walk",
          "Out of this world scenery,  the walk is not for the faint hearted.  \u00a35 car park . No toilet.",
          "Amazing views. Didn't manage to get up the top as it was super windy and too dangerous to keep going. Lots of people near the carpark but the walk was a bit too challenging for it to be crowded. My favourite part to a trip to Skye",
          "This place is magical. Unforgetable views in all this area of Skye... You just have to be lucky enough to get a sunny and not much windy day,  but in Scotland that is something that is not easy to find. Nice place for an easy hike, accessible by anyone in an average condition.",
          "Excellent views of Isle of Skye. There are good photo spots near the parking lot and also along the trail. The trail is very well marked and good for all levels, though you are walking on the side of a very steep hill, so while the trail is \u2026",
          "A beautiful place to walk among old rocks. Amazing views.",
          "The Quiraing is an incredible feature. Lovely walk and the views were awesome. The only downside is how busy it was. The island in general was the busiest I've ever seen it. The level of idiocy regards parking on the single track road and \u2026",
          "My advice would be to go early as the parking is limited and people tend to dangerously start parking at the passing places....we went around 8.30am and only saw three other groups of walkers but by the time we finished the circuit, the car \u2026",
          "The scenery is magnificent and the hiking is enjoyable in sunny days",
          "Don\u2019t bother parking in the main car park, head on down a bit further and park near the cemetery.\nScramble up as far as you want for amazing views!",
          "Amazing rock formations. Amazing views.",
          "Beautiful breathtaking scenery. Good for hiking, though some parts are difficult to get across.",
          "Just amazing place to visit, no pictures can describe this place, you need to visit it yourself.",
          "This is a beautiful hike that brings you right up and along a mountainside that offers incredible views of the very unique landscapes below. At the end of the hike that goes around the rock formations, you can continue up to the top of the \u2026",
          "Spectacular. Go early or late to avoid the crowds. And make a loop of it. And consider hiking south on the Trotternish Ridge from the opposite side of the road.",
          "If you are on Skye, make this the one place that you visit. The walk is amazing and the views are the best I've seen in the uk. Go and see it!",
          "Awesome views, one of the best hikes ever.",
          "This was one of the most amazing hikes I have ever been on, it rivals the Na Pali coast hikes in my opinion in terms of beauty, views, rock formations. We did the ~4.5 mile loop where you start at the car park and go along the traverse \u2026",
          "Can get very busy at any time of year. Get away from the car park and main view point, only then can you truly appreciate the spectacle of this place. If you are up to it, you can go over the plateau and do a circular walk. That's not \u2026",
          "The best views on Skye. Many different legs to the walk means you are getting a ever-changing backdrop to take in. Some parts can be tricky because of the mud.",
          "Beautiful views, place from Lord of the Rings\nYou can stay there whole day and its not enough",
          "Amazing place but accessible by road so do not stay and get moving towards Trotterish Ridge to enjoy these \"massive\" views and the whole environment.\n\nThe more you go, more you see.\n\nShowers of rain happen from time to time. Get used to it ;-)",
          "breathtaking views. very windy. cows!",
          "Remote\nThere is a reason wildlife photographers come here, mind you I don't know where the wildlife was but the views are nice. Be prepared for the wind and the tiny bugs trying to bite your face to bits. Come prepared (walking boots, hydration and layers) and plan your route and just take in the bliss",
          "As the sun washes over the landscape during our early morning climb, we are once again reminded of the vastness of nature and it's beauty. The lack of signs makes every turn and every corner into and adventure",
          "Beautiful scenery.difficult walk ! Round trip at least 3 hours",
          "Fantastic part of the Trotternish ridge mountain range. Have walked the hike on and around the ridge. Landscape is stunning. The hike was realively easy as the path is usually easy to follow and not too hard.",
          "One good trek! For us, The Isle of Skye trip would have been incomplete without this trek.",
          "Uplifts your soul... An absolutely brilliant place for a day or even camping... Might want to be careful as the path can be very narrow and slippery especially if it rains...\n\nFood on wheels close to the start had great options as well",
          "A must visit. Amazing view upon arrival.",
          "Breathtaking hike. Wear suitable shoes, you\u2019re going to get wet.",
          "Simply stunning!!!",
          "Stunning place. Well worth a walk but go early as it can get busy.",
          "Great for adventurous mountain bikers. Go early to miss the crowds and expect epic views, wind and some awesome riding. The American tourists will love you \ud83d\ude02",
          "Great place to hike",
          "I'm terrified of heights, however, I would've regretted not doing a hike here. It was breathtaking, wonderful, & beautiful. Plus it was awesome getting to see where part of one of my favorite movies was filmed. (Stardust)",
          "Not an easy climb, but the view is spectacular!",
          "A very nice and scenic trekking. It takes about 3 hours the whole round.",
          "Stunning landscape, beautiful mountains & rock formations. You will not be disappointed. Small car park so everyone parking on the verge.",
          "Some challenging walkinng trails\nSpectacular views if you make the effort.",
          "Stunningly beautiful, you have never seen anything this awesome. Well worth the trip.",
          "Beats the Old Man of Stor hands down IMHO. Easier to walk as level, and higher elevation affords better views. Can be made in a loop, instead of up/down. Has lots of interesting rock spires (although admittedly they are not as dramatic as \u2026",
          "One of the most scenic views I've ever seen",
          "Great hike up, not too tough and great views of the ocean and the isle of sky!",
          "The view is great, but it is not so easy as I read from the internet.",
          "Best thing in isle of the Skye is to do the hike. Views are amazing.",
          "Extremely beautiful.",
          "Amazing views !",
          "Plan at least 3 hours to spend around. We started on the level track going below the ridge and came back on top - which proved to be an amazing circuit. Beware of boggy places towards the end of the path, on the way back down to the parking. Sturdy boots are definitely recommended. Avoid the circuit in high winds or heavy mist.",
          "Amazing walk and scenery - but definitely aim for an early start if you want a bit of solitude whilst walking. Some tricky spots in the walk and the final descent back to the car park was very interesting!!!",
          "Expect amazing views, especially if you take the long route to the top of the mountain.",
          "Definitely one of the more impressive stops in Skye. Dramatic landscapes, a winding road and the emerald green colour of the surrounding landscap.  Fun to hike, but from the parking there are also opportunities to take nice pictures of the \u2026",
          "On a day with good visibility this hike is stunning.  If you hike a lot then it's not a very hard hike but one that will require some time.  My biggest tip for anyone doing this hike is to actually go clockwise instead of the way almost \u2026",
          "Awesome hike! We did the full Quiraing circle walk and it was really great. Come early for easy parking (@08:00 was om - can be crowded later in the day) A few harder inclines, but nothing serious if you take it slow. Great views! The hike can be very windy, so remember your windbreaker.",
          "Spectacular view if you walk the whole loop.",
          "Incredible walk, took a few hours, check the weather",
          "Out of this world experience if you take the hiking round trip.",
          "One of the most stunning places I've ever been. Make sure and do the full circular route so that you get up to the highest points. From there you can see as far as the Outer Hebrides.",
          "Go there and enjoy!!",
          "What can you say about this place that would do it justice? I would recommend following the path to the north from the parking lot until you reach the second fence line. Cross over and keep heading north to the top of the cliffs that look \u2026",
          "One of the most beautiful hikes I\u2019ve ever done.",
          "This was such a good, fun hike.",
          "Exciting trail, recommended for nature lover of all age.",
          "Great place! Lovely place to take in the area of Skye! Beautiful place to go and visit",
          "Amazing views and perfect hiking.  Don't miss this opportunity to see the best views of the highlands.  Bring plenty of water and good hiking boots.  May need your midgie spray too!",
          "The walk down the cliff is nice. You can climb up on both ends and enjoy the view, but the path is badly damaged because used too much when the soil is wet. On the southern part especially ascent and descent are dangerous.",
          "This is our most favourite walk on Skye, and is most certainly the most rewarding. We recommend it to everyone who asks. Parking in July and August can be a nightmare before you start the walk but there are plans in place to rectify that soon. The walk (path) itself is perfectly suitable for all ages and all abilities.",
          "Awesome view and trek",
          "This is a stunning area of beauty and bad weather, with long walks that can be accomplished by most people. Lots of mud and beautiful views. The temperature can be cold, so be prepared. Rain is always there ready to get you, so also be \u2026",
          "Very nice walk. In a sunny day the landscape is amazing. It is very turistic and it can get a bit crowded so it is better starting the walk early.",
          "Such a fantastic hike with really magnificent views! Majestic is the word that comes to mind. It really puts into perspective just how small we are comparatively",
          "Great little walk, can get busy.",
          "Amazing walk with sensational views. If you are visiting Skye then the Quiraing is a must. We were lucky to have beautiful weather for our visit and could have stayed forever.",
          "One of the most beautiful places I have ever been",
          "A great place to wild camp. Within about five to ten minutes of the car park, there are some great spots to set up your tent with amazing views all around. I highly recommend wild camping. This or staying in a bothy are must dos for anyone going to the Isle of Skye",
          "Spectacular nature of the Isle of Skye. Definitely worth the ride (or walk up). But be aware, the road is not suited for scared drivers I would say. The views on top are unbeaten, even in rainy weather like we experienced. \n\nI would advise to come early or arrive lTe because parking is limited.",
          "absolutely worth the hike if you can get er done!",
          "Really great place. Even better when raining since there won't be much tourists.\nSome iden paths, that might not be for the faint or heart, can lead you to the top of the mountains. Epic photo shots from there.",
          "One of the best hikes I've taken. Do yourself a favor and go all the way to the Flodigarry viewpoint. Breathtaking views. Be prepared though! Winds are VERY strong and when a quick storm blows though, which happened 3 times on our 4 hour \u2026",
          "Really long trail through the mountains. Views are astonishing from the beginning of it, so you can walk as much as you can and go back to the car without feeling guilty. Might not be suitable for everyone, there are some slippery areas due to the water falling from the mountains and others due to pebbles on the narrow path.",
          "Perhaps the best place in whole scotland",
          "A must place to stop and go for a walk, especially if you're a keen photographer. \nAs with most west coast locations the weather can be unpredictable so come prepared and keep to the path if you didn't! \nSpectacular views of the rock formations themselves as well as views of the mainland to the east.",
          "Definitely a hard hike. Was really Misty and rainy the entire time. We had trouble making it over the summit. Would love to try again someday more prepared!",
          "Just stunning view.",
          "Beautiful walk, with a very rewarding finish. Some scrabbly parts, appropriate footwear us a must!",
          "Beautiful nature walk with iconic views, definite must of you're traveling through Isle of Skye. Just don't forget to bring proper shoes, expect strong winds in some places and plan for about 2 hours.",
          "This is a beautiful place to stop and hike, the views are amazing and the parking space is very conveniently located.",
          "For sure climb to the top!!",
          "It is one of the best place to view the scenery in Isle of Skye. After a long walk from the starting point, the view from above is outstanding. You can see the lake and some hills from here. The path is not always great, but it will be worthwhile after the walk. To get here is a must.",
          "Stunningly amazing! Worth a day to spend... for the nerds probably two",
          "A must see on Skye. Very dramatic sight and it surprises you most when you come by the road from Uig. You can just stop and snap your picture or you can walk to the Prison and the Needle. Both are very rewarding, so everybody can enjoy.",
          "An awesome walk - definitely deserves a high recommendation. Don't park at the public parking. Go to the cemetery instead. From there you will have two options to hike to The Prison and The Needle.",
          "Legendary and breathtaking walk. Good options for both beginners and hard-core hikers. This alone would be enough to make a visit to Skye worthwhile!",
          "I would never get bored with this view.",
          "Accidentally dropped an apple and it went rolling down the side at high speed. On the other hand, amazing views on this hiking circuit.",
          "While all of the Isle of Skye is beautiful, Ferry Pools, Kilt, etc., nothing compares to the magnitude of the beauty here. After hiking for 10 minutes beyond the car park, we were alone for most of the 2-3 hours here.  We took the (main) lower route north of the road - which seems to have been the correct choice. Really unforgettable.",
          "Quiraing!!!? Don't take my word . Just go . Isle of sky. The Storr .",
          "The view was amazing!!",
          "Amazing views all throughout the hiking route. If going right after a rain, beware of falling rocks and very muddy terrain.",
          "Awesome views. Start your walk taking the steep part up, on the other side it's easy to go down again. The other way around it might be dangerous for the inexperienced.",
          "A sheep once bit my sister.",
          "The Quiraing is an absolutely stunning hiking area, with an other-worldly look and feel to the place that will leave you in awe. The main hiking trail is not particularly difficult, with the trail going only up and down slight \u2026",
          "Amazing!",
          "Wasn't the best weather but its an experience being up there. Its all wet and cloudy when I was up there.",
          "Not an easy one whatsoever!  It\u2019s challenging and despite the awesome whether there\u2019s still unavoidable bits of mud that really gets into the shoes! Ugh!  Too many peaks!  To really do it, set aside the most part of the day cos it\u2019s a hell of a trek!",
          "Walk through and enjoy the landscape",
          "Amazing place, well worth the hike even in the mist.",
          "Brautiful Lord of the ring landscape \ud83d\ude00 Was really windy here, so we just took a look from lookout spot. Parking free.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful hike, but the signs marking the two trails weren\u2019t clear, so we ended up on the harder path, which is fine. We just tried to get as far as we could in an hour and turned around (the full trek takes 3-5 hours). \n\nBe sure to \u2026",
          "Very beautiful. Been here few times. First on a attempt do Skye trail over winter which I had give up on due to strong strong wind and just now in June which I finally completed Skye trail. This is one my favourite parts of the trail",
          "Great place to climb amazing views ( just bearing in mind be careful very slippy due to all the loose stone could easily fall to your death )",
          "Killer place, breathtaking scenery",
          "Just go! Dress for the walk and enjoy the wilderness.",
          "Probably the most scenic walk I've ever done in my life!  We walked from the top car park, probably about half-way along, and then doubled back.  The beginning part of the track is quite flat and suitable for children, but there are some \u2026",
          "Gorgeous sunsets, best views of the stars and incredible sunrises what more could you want?",
          "Prepare for wind. Put your phone down, and be present in this stunning place.",
          "Nice walk, several steps / uneven areas / steep bits. Path is narrow in places, with sheer drops. Would recommend got footwear (walking boots), many people were also using walking poles, but would be fine if you wanted to go without poles in my opinion. Nice views",
          "Great hike, lovely views",
          "What a truly stunning place. Felt like we were in the lord of the rings",
          "Popular for walkers, but a good bucket list MTB ride; get there early to avoid the crowds.",
          "The view is breathtaking.  I would love to go hiking there again.",
          "Fabulous hike in the mountains!  Most people who go just go up the trail a little ways and take some photos but they are missing the best that this place has to offer!  It is worth doing the whole loop trail.  I think it took us between 2 \u2026",
          "Vast, stunning natural beauty. Be sure you do the full loop that goes to the very top. The view is worth the hike.",
          "Great walk but more testing and quite dangerous in parts so please be aware before attempting. Stunning views",
          "Great walk, wonderful weather",
          "Wear appropriate footwear! It's a pretty narrow path & you have to climb over lots of stuff. I was a little terrified, but it so very worth it. The views are incredible & it's just stunning.",
          "Been there twice and it's always amazing. A good place to witness the sunrise.",
          "Stunning part of Scotland, well worth a trop",
          "Nice place for hiking difficult paths you have to got necessary accessories like warm jacket, boots, gloves independent from the weather if is good a good jacket and gloves in pretty cool, and most important you have to got  very patience \u2026",
          "One of the best places to hike on Skye. The scenery is similar to the Old Man of Storr, although the Quiraing is farther away from Portree and a little bit harder to get to. There is plenty of parking along the road near the trailhead, \u2026",
          "If you have ever wanted to feel like your returning jewellery to mordor this is the place to go",
          "Absolutely stunning and spellbinding!",
          "Amazing hike, the views!",
          "I drove up over here on the longest day of the year just before sunset and it was absolutely stunning. this place is other worldly and you can see why its used as a location for lots of different films.  Take your time and enjoy this \u2026",
          "U can see spectacle views from here, but there were full of cars in close passing places. Strongly recommend to enjoy walking around here.",
          "Amazing scenery and great hiking trails.  Scotland at its most beautiful. Providing you don\u2019t just park up, walk 10m and take pictures before leaving like a lot of tourists! Get out there and enjoy the heights and views.",
          "Perfect hike",
          "Stunning! Wear full rain gear, sturdy weatherproof foot wear, be prepared for wind, rain, mist and sunshine - all in the one hike!",
          "Can be super windy. Amazing views make it worth while.",
          "If you come to Skye, you really must visit this place. The road up offers some of the most iconic scenery the island has to offer, and the views from the top are breathtaking. Don't cheat yourself out of a visit to this place. ",
          "Very nice mountains, awesome views ale sheeps on the top hills. Really nice trip here, but be careful as the path is a bit wet and hill is steep.",
          "Stunning views of Skye and pictures can\u2019t do justice to this place at all.",
          "Great loop hike, or add it to some of the other trails.  Proper footware and some planning is a must, temperature vary significantly in parts of the route.  Stunning vistas and great spots for a picknic allong the way!",

          "Among the best hikes you can do, period. Breathing views, rugged landscapes, sea and mountains, just wow.",
          "Perfect home for those who who want to see a beautiful spot on the skye but cant do a difficult hike. Views start once you park your car and continue the whole hike!",
          "Stunning scenery if you're lucky enough to visit on a clear day.",
          "Magical walk but wrap up against the wind!",
          "great views all round, especially if you walk far enough from the carpark to be away from the crowds. The fastest way to get a good view of the range will be to follow the path from the carpark till you come to a fork, take the left fork \u2026",
          "Long and majestic walk. Hard to describe it - you simply have to be there yourself to see it :) . At start of it there is parking with enough pretty places for picnic. ",
          "Gorgeous, awe inspiring, \"wow\" moments every step of the way.  Bring trekking poles if your unsure of your step.  This narrow, sometimes exhilarating, walk had a few places where people decide not to go further because of steep drops.",

          "If you hike in Skye and don't go here, you're not living your best life. Bring real hiking shoes.",

          "Amazing scenery. Lots of people up there so go early!",
          "Perfect getaway place to trek. My entire hike was 4 hours long, but I took many breaks to admire the views and to snap a few photos. If not, 3 hours would have been fine. The trek is not very difficult, but children and the elderly will \u2026",
          "What a wonderful trekk, completely into arms of mother nature , make sure to wear trekking shoe and carry water along, there is a food truck near the parking but I would suggest don't rely on it,there is no washroom around or even close to \u2026",

        "wiki": "Talisker distillery is an Island single malt Scotch whisky distillery based in Carbost, Scotland on the Isle of Skye. The distillery is operated by Diageo, and Talisker's 10 year old expression has been nominated as part of their Classic Malts series. The brand is considered a premium Single Malt Whisky.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe distillery was founded in 1830 by Hugh and Kenneth MacAskill, and built in 1831 at Carbost after a number of false starts on other sites when they acquired the lease of Talisker House from the Macleod of MacLeod . The distillery was rebuilt 1880\u201387 and extended in 1900. When a new lease for the distillery was negotiated with the chief of Clan MacLeod in 1892 the annual payment was to be \u00a323.12s and a ten-gallon cask of best-quality Talisker. It was rebuilt in 1960 after a stillhouse fire completely destroyed the distillery. The distillery operates five stills; two wash stills and three spirit stills. All the stills use worm tubs (condensing coils) rather than a modern condenser, which are believed to give the whisky a \"fuller\" flavour (itself an indication of higher sugar content). During this early period, the whisky was produced using a triple distilling method, but changed to the more conventional double distilling in 1928. Talisker was acquired by Distillers Company in 1925 and is now part of Diageo. After the 1960 fire, five exact replicas of the original stills were constructed to preserve the original Talisker flavour. In 1972 the stills were converted to steam heating and the maltings floor was demolished. Talisker's water comes from springs directly above the distillery via a network of pipes and wells.\nThe malted barley used in production comes from Muir of Ord. Talisker has an unusual feature\u2014swan neck lye pipes. A loop in the pipes takes the vapour from the stills to the worm tubs so some of the alcohol already condenses before it reaches the cooler. It then runs back into the stills and is distilled again. Talisker now has an annual output of three and a half million litres of spirit.\nTalisker was the favourite whisky of writers Robert Louis Stevenson and HV Morton. In his poem \"The Scotsman's Return From Abroad\", Stevenson mentioned \"The king o' drinks, as I conceive it, Talisker, Islay, or Glenlivet.\"\nRecently, Talisker has come under scrutiny after a radiocarbon study suggested Talisker 1863 whisky was produced much later, either between 1957-58 or 2007-2014.\n\n\n== Character ==\n\nThe spirit is most frequently matured in American oak casks. The malt is peated to a phenol level of approximately 18\u201322 parts per million (ppm), which is a medium peating level. Additionally, the water used for production, from Cnoc nan Speireag (Hawk Hill), flows over peat which adds additional complexity to the whisky.\nThe distillery began producing special bottlings of the whisky for connoisseurs in the early 2000s, with a 20- and 25-year bottling (where previously only a 10-year and 18-year were available). The 25-year bottling, despite being more expensive than the 20-year bottling, was distributed more widely.\nIn 2007 Talisker 18-year-old won \"Best Single Malt In The World 2007\" at the World Whiskies Awards. and in 2015 Talisker 10 Year Old won a Double Gold Medal and \"Best Single Malt Scotch up to 12 years\" in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.\n\n\n== Bottlings ==\n\nTalisker 10 Year Old\nTalisker Skye\nTalisker Storm\nTalisker Dark Storm\nTalisker 18 year Old (limited annual run)\nTalisker 25 year Old (limited annual run)\nTalisker 30 year Old (limited annual run)\nTalisker Distiller's edition\nTalisker 57\u00b0 North\nTalisker Port Ruighe\nTalisker Neist Point\n\n\n== Reviews and accolades ==\nTalisker whiskies have generally performed very well at international Spirit ratings competitions and have won some acclaim from liquor review organizations.  The 10-, 18-, 25- and 30-year Taliskers have been awarded mostly gold medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.  The 10- and 18-year varieties, meanwhile, have received scores of 85-89 and 90-95 from Wine Enthusiast.  Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and others, classifies Talisker's 10-year scotch in its highest (\"Tier 1\") performance category.Talisker Distiller's Edition won Best Islands Single Malt at the 2013 World Whiskies Awards.\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nTalisker is repeatedly referenced in the BBC Radio 4 comedy Cabin Pressure. Three separate episodes (\"Edinburgh\" in series 1, \"Paris\" in series 3 and \"Timbuktu\" in series 4) revolve around First Officer Douglas Richardson's attempts to steal 25-year aged Talisker whisky rightfully belonging to the wealthy regular passenger Mr Birling, and it is also mentioned in several other episodes.\nIn the movie Charlie Wilson's War, CIA agent Gust Avrakotos presents US Rep. Wilson a bottle of Talisker. The agent explains to Charlie the scotch is mentioned in a Robert Louis Stevenson poem, \"The Scotsman's Return From Abroad\". The bottle is bugged and allows him to listen to the congressman's conversations.\nTalisker is also referenced in John LeCarre's \"A Legacy of Spies,\" as Alec Leamus' favorite.\nIn the 2019 Amazon Prime / BBC co-production Good Omens, the demon Crowley (played by Scotsman David Tennant) drinks Talisker by the bottle as he awaits the coming apocalypse. Director Douglas Mackinnon is from the Isle of Skye and inserted references to his home area wherever he could.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of whisky brands\nList of distilleries in Scotland\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGeneral\n\nStephan Gab\u00e1nyi (1997).

          "Of course, the well known distilleries offering tours are tourist attractions. Well, so I cam to visit as well. As Talisker produces Whisky the styl I prefer (smoky...) and I spent a week in the Highlands not too far, I decided to go there, and book a tour. It was nice, the",
          "On a day of torrential rain and whipping winds that had the Hebridean sheep screaming for their brollies, we drove down the single-passage roads of Skye to the ends of the earth on our quest to uncover the greatness of Talisker Whiskey. We arrived to a half-filled car park in",

The tour was very intriguing, although I think that if you\u2019ve done another whisky distillery tour, there won\u2019t be much different to this tour. Since we had never",

          "The distillery is located in such a nice setting! We booked a tour around the distillery and it was well worth it. Lots of interesting information and a tester at the end. Afterwards we had a proper taste of different kinds at the bar and we bought a nice bottle afterwards.",
          "Rommy was a lovely guide and the tour is short but really nice! Especially the washing tons were awesome to see!",
          "We are disappointed. Talisker is a factory. Big buildings. Rich shop offers set of different brands owned by same company. No soul of own product. Just offer. I am not a fan of smoky whiskey. But travelling around Scotland - we decided to give Talisker another try. Day was long",

          "We had, hands down, the worst tour guide I have ever had anywhere ever. Katherine could not be more poorly suited for her job - no energy, no humor, no apparent interest in the subject, and she talked so incredibly slowly it was honestly like some kind of joke. She had obviously",
          "We took the tour and were lucky enough to have Gordon as our guide. It was informative and funny, so it never really got too heavy with facts. He was quite good at making sure that if we had some questions that they would be answered. Humorous guy with a lot of knowledge.",

          "We booked our tour ahead from home, but on arrival that didn't really seem necessary. Anyways, Luke took us on an interesting and witty tour of the premises. As I am just getting to know whisky, I learned a lot and still have a lot of tasting to do. We tasted the Talisker Storm",
          "Great tour. The guide was very good and took all questions well. The wee dram tasting session was lovely. It you like peaty whisky, you\u2019ll love this tour. The smell of the peaty toasted barley alone sent me to whisky heaven.",

If you have time check out Gleann Bhreatail (Glen Brittle) on the way back, allow at least an hour and",

          "Make sure you\u2019re on the tasting tour, tasting six different whiskies! It\u2019s more expensive, but worth it! No need to buy whisky. It\u2019s 5-10 pounds more expensive than at Systembolaget in Sweden.",
          "Well done Talisker. Great team, bright and knowledgable guide coping really well with our multi-national tour group. Nice \u2018wee\u2019 shop, with healthy choice of whiskies!

          "This great old destillery was great to visit. The tour can be recommended! Even if you're unable to book online, due to unavailability, they do reserve spots for people that walk in, but a good advice is to book at least a day in advance! The tour is complete with a tasting at",

          "Visited on a wet Thursday arvo. Really interesting tour of the distillery. Finished at 5 and everything was closing up so no chance for further tastings. Audio on tour needs adjusting as hard to hear the guide. There were lots of people moving through the centre so definitely",
          "We stopped in knowing the tours were booked, so I am only reviewing the tasting. I chose the elite flight- it came with incredibly large pours of 3 scotches, that ran the gamut of honeyed to a bit smoky/peppery to full bodied, sherry cask aged. You also get water and dropper in",

          "The location and the road there were spectacular. It was in the beginning of the season and our guide had been there less than two weeks but she managed to give an ok tour. At the end we had a tasting of Talisker Stormy. The bar had a good selection of whiskeys to try with",
          "Thanks for the tour Matthew. Was my first distillery tour and the bar has been set high. Matthew was friendly and knowledgeable, staying behind at the end during the tasting to answer all of our questions. The distillery itself was impressive and in a picturesque location.",
          "Talisker must be more popular than I thought, as the place was busy for a weekday morning. The reception area is well designed and appointed, with a retail shop on one side and informative exhibits and tour sales on the other. We had a wait before our tour began, but",

The access road is (understandably) wall-papered with \u201cresidents only\u201d parking signs, so it\u2019s up to Talisker to engineer a parking solution in such a tight area. The place is an absolute",

          "Talisker was the first distillery we visiting on our journey through Scotland, and it couldn't have been a better start. We had booked the full tour & tasting and it was well worth it. Our guide, Rommy, was a joy - very informative, personable, and kind. It was fun to see the",
          "Highly recommended. Shout out to our guide Nick, who explained everything in great detail. It's easy to notice how enthusiastic he is about Talisker, and that made the experience very enjoyable. Great tasting at the end of the tour. I must say I wasn't a big fan of whisky before",
          "My husband and I went on a vacation to Scotland for our anniversary. Talisker is a brand that we'd heard of before, so we decided to pay a little extra for the special whiskey and chocolates experience. All in all, a very good tour. Our guide, John, was informative and friendly.",

          "It is always to see the place which supplies whisky to the world. I went with too excitement but after the tour not very happy The guided tour had limited information 10 pound ticket and a taste of talisker is for taste not even half peg In short nothing exciting",
          "You cannot be in Scotland and not do a distillery tour. Talisker is located in the Isle of Skye and is the oldest running distillery in the region. Its set on the shore of Loch Harport. The distillery offers a classic and a tasting tour. We took the tasting tour, which costs",

          "The classic distillery tour at the Talisker Distillery was a great way to see the process and get a much better understanding of the craft that goes into making Scotch whiskey. Our guide Gordon was super informative and funny as well. Gordon was able to answer all our questions",
          "Good tour by Ronnie, who took us through the process and then gave us a sample dram of one of their newer scotches. Talisker has a fairly unique character, and while it's not my favorite whiskey I did appreciate what it had to offer, especially with Ronnie taking us through the",

          "Bit naffed off that we couldn't go on the tour with our 1yr old after travelling all that way. Not really much to see otherwise except a gift shop selling a few bottles and talisker branded jumpers.",
          "Lovely setting on the waters edge, right at the end of a single track road through the small village of Carbost. We didn\u2019t do a tour, so we can\u2019t comment on that. It was definitely busy in the visitors centre, but we managed to find a table to stand at with our drinks. Two of us",

          "We hadn\u2019t realised that Talisker was taking part in the Whisky festival and it was very busy when we arrived. They were trying out free short tours - quick, but taking in the main areas and with time to read the boards. Our guide was John and he brought it all to life. The main",
          "Booked in advance on line and am very glad I did, completely sold out today. Very informative and interesting tour led by Nick. Followed by a tasting masterclass. No hard sell but \u00a35 discount. Highly recommended",

          "The Distillery tour is excellent and very personal. Make sure you make a reservation in advance, that helps to avoid waiting time. It can be quite busy. They done a great shop where you can buy all Talisker products and also some other Scottish Whisky. The tour is in groups of",
          "Really enjoyed our tour of Talisker this morning. We have done a few distillery tours and understand the process of making Whisky but it is interesting to see what they believe makes Talisker unique.our guide was knowledgable and friendly encouraging people to ask questions.",
          "I have visited a couple of distilleries and thought I was fairly conversant with the process, but my visit to Talisker proved to be a learning experience. Our guide John, was extremely knowledgeable and made the visit a good experience, and I came away having been told some",
          "We took the standard 45 minute tour with a single taste. It was a very interesting over view of the whiskey production process, with highlights of Tallisker specifically. MIke really made the tour special, with his wealth of knowledge and charming, fun personality. You have your",

          "Worth a visit! Even if you don\u2019t drink whisky, you can still enjoy the craft in it, and the success of keeping exact replica of what you beleave is the perfect spirit. The making is in the barrel! Sl\u00e1inte!",
          "We were pleased to get the opportunity to visit the distillery when we were on the Isle. Around 30-40 minutes from Portree, the distillery is in Carbost. Visitors collect their tickets from the visitor and gift centre. Our tour guide, Kathryn, was really good. Very",
          "We had visited other destiler\u00edas before and this one was by far the most boring and uninteresting. Our guide was robotic, lack passion for the subject and didn\u2019t interact much Witt the group. The content of the visit was only focused on industrial processes and did say little",
          "We arrived on time for the 4pm tour but had trouble parking as the car park was very small. We sent some of our party ahead whilst the drivers looked for alternative parking. Both the initial members and the drivers were very rudely spoken to by the reception staff and by the",

          "Since the early 90's Talisker 10 has been my housewhisky, the benchmark in my cabinet if you will. So finally visiting the distillery after al these years of enjoying this whisky was a very suitable gift for my 50th birthday. After an extensive tour of the distillery Hugh, our",
          "Was not impressed early as we had to wait 35 minutes. But one of the guides started telling us about various item in the visitor area and was quite interesting. Tour started and I think it was too many people but the guide was the guy helping us inside. Hard to hear but we moved",
          "We had a fantastic time at the distillery. We did a chocolate and whiskey pairing tour and Nick, our guide was brilliant! His knowledge and passion for whiskey was super and engaging! All topped off with some great tastings at the end!",
          "My fiancee and I visited today and had the privilege of having Mike show us around. He gave a great tour and shared some new whiskys that neither of us had before, which was awesome. Everyone was super friendly and happy to chat, I couldn't recommend the trip more. We'll",

          "When we visited the Talisker distillery there were no tours running due to construction/ refurbishment. A very kind man named Gordon offered a small group of us a small viewing of the barrel basement anyway. He spoke to us for 30 minutes about the process of making Scotch",
          "We had a great tour of the distillery! My wife has trouble with a lot of stairs but the tour guide made sure she was OK every step of the way even though we were only 2 of a tour of 12. Nice history of the place and a little tasting once we were done. Our tour guide, I forget",

          "This was a birthday tour for my partner and our guide was Nick. The tour was originally small in size but walk-in bookings made it a large 12-15 people group. Great guide, tried to make the experience as personal as possible, kept everyone together and was helpful and",
          "We were taken on a grand tour of the distillery and learned how they make scotch and the history behind it. We even got a taste test. Our tour guide was very knowlegeable. Then we were able to purchase some Scotch to take home.",
          "Popped in here Monday the 14th in the hopes of having a tour. We just missed the tour but nick the man on duty that day took time out and talked us through the history of the distillery and his interpretations on the whisky he helps produce. He really knew what he was talking",
          "I really enjoyed this distillery. Our guide was very knowledgeable and it was an interesting distillery. I learned a lot about whiskey that I never knew before. There is a tasting at the end and their gift shop is excellent.",
          "On our visit we took a guided tour and were thoroughly impressed with our new guide. There is a lot of history to be discovered and the story of distilling whisky the Talisker way was super. There was also a small tasting included. The shop had loads of bottles I would love to",
          "What an impressive place this is, you can sample two spirits, there are more than just Whiskies here. The shop is good lots of items to sell. It can get very crowded when lots of buses arrive, so worth the visit.",
          "I finally made it, wanted to visit here for years and the location is stunning. The weather the day I visited was cold clear and sunny one of those days that make you feel alive. Ended up being the only person on the tour essentially a private tour. Great fun and filled with",
          "Another stunning location for a distillery. We had no objection to paying \u00a310 for the tour. However Diageo have added their corporate touch which takes away from the personal approach in a number of other Scottish distilleries. I would have thought with the revenue generated",
          "Had a brilliant experience going round Talisker Distillery - it was the last one my husband and I had to do on our whisky passports so we\u2019re slightly disappointed not to get a Quaich but know we can send for one instead. Our guide was very knowledgeable and was quite new to the",
          "My biggest mistake was to buy a bottle of Talisker Storm and Talisker Port Ruighe Back in Sweden prices are cheaper or at least the same ! Do the tour if you like but DONT buy from them Overpriced, expected better prices not more expensive than Sweden ! (systembolaget)",
          "We drove to Carbost for a tour around Talisker Distillery, John was our tour guide, around 18 in the group. John was great showing us everything and explaining in great details everything that goes into making the tasty whiskey.",
          "Loved my visit here, the guide was suer fun and friendly, and the whiskey tastng was unforgettable of course. Something unique and not to be missed when on Skye",
          "Talisker is one of the more significant brands of whiskey in the western part of Scotland and is well know world-wide. They have a large visitor centre and regular professional tours. Don't expect anything too intimate but they have a polished delivery of their tours which",
          "The staff here were excellent - extremely knowledgeable. We sampled a few special edition whiskeys not available in shops. Also the 8-yr old was surprisingly flavoursome! Lots of variety & something for everyone. We didn\u2019t do the distillery tour - but it was free (& busy",
          "Talisker Distillery is set in a beautiful part of Skye (let's be real, all of Skye is beautiful), right on the water. We went on the distillery tour that runs a couple of times per day; I had booked online a couple of weeks prior, but it didn't seem entirely necessary to book",
          "We did the tour and it was quite good, very informative and ended up with tasting Talisker 18 years. Nice area and beautiful surroundings.",
          "Very interesting tour with entertaining guide; learned a lot about distilling and tried a few scotches before selecting one to bring home!",
          "An interesting tour around this distillery. Nice to learn that local spring water and peat are used to help produce this island gold. A beautiful drive to get there and I\u2019d recommend staying at Portree.",
          "This place is a total rip off! I would not recommend buying any whisky there without googling supermarket prices first! Bought Talisker Sky and Storm at the shop only to find out that the Waitrose was selling the same bottles \u00a315 and \u00a310 cheaper ( even with their \u00a35 off voucher",
          "If you are on Skye, it's a bit of a 'must do', but of the distilleries we visited it definitely was the least inviting. Very corporate in feel - staff in the visitor's centre were polite but not exactly friendly. There was a bar serving whisky, of course, but no teas/coffees.",
          "The overnight hours brought the seasons first dusting of snow, and a cold chill. We were warmed by our guides smile and enthusiasm for his topic (Nick). This was a delightful tour, much enjoyed by all, and our Guides knowledge and experience as well as his passion for the topic",
          "Visited the distillery with my father and we both had a great time. We did a classic tour for \u00a310 each, which lasts for about 45 minutes and we get to learn about the process that is undertaken to distil and bottle Talisker\u2019s whiskey. Our guide Matthew was very kind and",
          "And an escape from the rain ! All tours had sold out glad we booked. Older children are allowed on the tour . We opted for the 1 hour tour. Gareth the tour guide made it interesting , husband couldn\u2019t escape without buying some Taliskers to take home on the way out. Lovely art",
          "Although we knew the kids wouldn\u2019t be allowed on the tour we were slightly disappointed by the tastings offered. Instead of giving recommendations, staff just expect you to pick a whisky off the menu and pay per tot (which can become quite pricey). There wasn\u2019t really any staff",
          "A wonderful informative tour and well worth the \u00a310 for and hour's visit with lots of knowledge and experience seeing all round the distillery, learned a lot and even had a dram at the end too to taste.",
          "Interesting if interested in whiskey. Notably, the barley is trucked from east coast of Scotland and the whiskey is bottled elsewhere. Hardly worth the \u00a310 price of the tour. However Isle of Skye is well worth the long ride from Edinburgh.",
          "We had the great pleasure of having a tour lead by Georgina at Tallisker. Her explanation of the full process from roasting the grain to the final barreling of the Scotch was informative and fun! I would highly recommend both the tour and the post tour tasting. Be sure to make a",
          "Thank you for a wonderful tour. Very interesting and amusing. We went on the 1pm tour and our guide was fab! Very helpful to learn the flavours of the different whiskeys and how each distillery differs. I could imagine going back 100s of years and how it would have been then.",
          "I was keen to learn about the whiskey making process and this tour was ideal. Very informative guide explained the steps and showed us the working equipment. I didn't realise there was so much detail and care that goes into the making of whiskey, nor how long it takes! Well",
          "Great cheerful dark-haired female ex-Londoner guide. Very informative and genuinely engaged and interested in showing guests a good tour. Learned a bit more about whisky. Five out of five (Danish) stars.",
          "We don't drink much whisky but we are so glad we visited Talisker Distillery! Beautiful area and the tour was fantastic! We learned so much and loved our tour guide! I believe this is the only distillery on the island and it is very special. The whisky is smooth and",

          "If you like whiskey (and who doesn\u2019t), then seeing how its all made is a must. The tour takes less than an hour and only costs 10 pound and they give you a good tour of the place. It also includes a whiskey tasting at the end. Great if its a rainy day. You should note that its",
          "Decided to visit the distillery whilst nearby. Whilst it is a little out of the way, I am a big fan of the whisky so thought it be a great place to visit. The tour by Mike was very good and purchased a bottle of distillers exclusive - which you can only get at the distillery!",
          "We just recently did a distillery tour at Talisker. It was definitely worth the visit. Everything was well organised and Joe did a good tour.",
          "We were on holiday on Skye, it was raining so we decided to take a tour of the distillery. Despite it being October, it was still very busy so I would recommend booking in advance. Our guide was very knowledgeable of the distilling process and about the range of whiskies",
          "We were hoping to join a tour of the distillery. Unfortunately, there was no way to sign up via internet and calls to the phone numbers listed were not answered. Talisker is a long drive from anywhere on the Isle (let alone from the mainland), especially on an ugly stormy rainy",
          "Had to visit Talisker and sample a couple of their best. Worthwhile to take the tour and see the process. Shop had plenty to purchase but only purchased a sample pack due to travel on aircraft. Loved the Dark Storm and the lingering smoky aftertaste. Drink this neat. There is a",
          "This wasn't the first distillery tour I've been on but I have to say our tour guide was very good, patient and knowledgeable. I won't give anything away about the tour in case you want to go but the general tour lasts about an hour, and you will have to walk up a few steps",
          "A very interesting tour, and worth doing on a visit to Skye. We enjoyed the tour and bought a few bottles of whiskey whilst there. Combine it with a visit to the Oyster shack just up the road for a quick bite to eat afterwards, it\u2019s worth it.",
          "Excellent distillery on Isle of Skye. Great whisky\u2019s and a good visitor centre and a well stocked shop. A must for Whisky buffs",
          "Tour was very enlightening and guide very knowledgeable on the equipment and process that goes into producing Talisker whiskey",
          "I visited this distillery with a friend. Talisker being one of our favourite whiskies, we were keen to profit from our visit to the Isle of Skye. We did not make a reservation, but we were in luck and only had to wait one hour. The tour was very interesting. We were particularly",
          "Myself and my girlfriend were heading to Talisker Bay further along the road...but we stopped into the distillery none the less before heading round. The atmosphere around the place was great.... full of hustle and bustle from the bar at the back to the busy shop at the front.",
          "Tours book early so if you want to do that then book ahead. We went to the tasting bar and had a great tasting with a very knowledgeable staff member (female, blond short hair). They have a small and very interesting museum in there too.",
          "My partner and I like to stop in at distillery\u2019s and learn the different ways of making and casking the whiskey as well as tasting it of course! The tour at Talisker was so interesting and descriptive. Answered all our questions and had a good taste session at the end. Sadly the",
          "We stopped in one afternoon and were able to get on one of the last tours of the day. 5 stars to our tour guide, Gordon. He was informative about the process from the water, peat, and barley, to the coopers for barrel QC. The tour ended with a sample of Talisker Storm. The",

          "John, our guide, was very knowledgeable and explained the whole process of whisky making in good detail. The tour ended with a tasting of the Talisker Storm whisky and John explaining how best to enjoy whisky (without ice and with some water!). Worth a visit!",
          "You have to pre-book your tour online as it is unlikely if you arrive on the day and you will be able to get a tour. The tour was interesting and informative and the whisky tasting before and after the tour was excellent if you like smokey and peaty whiskies. Can be time",
          "Very informative tour and a nice \u2018wee dram\u2019 at the end. Good shop and a whisky bar if you\u2019re not sure which bottle to take home. Staff knowledgeable and helpful.",
          "Informative and if you like scotch you will be very happy here! They started on time and very knowledgeable and professional. Decent store. We made reservations - you shouldn\u2019t risk it as it is packed.",
          "We pre-booked online for a noon tour on September 25, a Tuesday. Luckily for us, it was a very rainy day so it was a good use of our time. When booking online on their website, we paid 10 GBP per person with a .60 booking fee. We came in at 11 and tried to get in on the 11 am",
          "We came to Skye with the soul purpose of visiting the Talisker Distilery. Granted the weather wasn't at it's best but they were hoarding everyone in. It was absolutely packed and only my husband was able to do the tour but if we came back two-days later they could fit me in.",
          "We arrived at the only distillery on the Isle of Skye and were greeted very warmly by the staff at the visitors centre. We had \u201cFriends of the Classic Malts\u201d passports and we were given complimentary drams. Staff was very outgoing and very helpful. There were four of us and we",
          "Tried to get on a tour but all were fully booked due to poor weather forcing everyone inside. Large selection of whiskies from the Talisker distillery as well as distiller's selections from other distilleries such as Oban and Lagavulin. We previously enjoyed Talisker Storm but",
          "Talisker is one of favourite whiskies, so really enjoyed the tour. Very friendly tour guide who peppered his talk with numerous jokes. Finished off with a sample of Talisker Storm.",
          "We had to take the upgraded tour \u00a315 as the \u00a310 tour was full (which gets you a second whisky and a chocolate). Gordon (I think) our guide mentioned that he was also a French trained chef. He was charming, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. I have been on several of these tours",
          "What a great place to visit. Perfect setting for a distillery, Our guide (Gordon) was the ideal person as a tour guide, knowledgeable, good humoured, explained the whole process without blinding you with science. Would recommend a visit to anyone with even a slight interest in",
          "The tour was excellent and the guide very knowledgeable. The shop could have been better stocked with a wider range of products and a little caf\u00e9 would have been a welcome addition, after all, someone has to drive!",
          "Fairly standard tour in a packed distillery. Well, everyone on Skye just has to see the biggest distillery - so did we. Diageo tours can be special, however not here. The tasting on the standard tour is fairly simple, more can be tried at the bar. However, if you are on the last",
          "We travelled from Edinburgh especially for the tour. Over booked, rushed through and they didnt have any driver dram containers, they said they were on back order so we never got to sample. The tour guide was not very personable and rushed through things. Having done many",
          "Our party of four thought the tour was very well executed and very informative, However, having been on quite a few distillery tours over the years at various locations in Speyside, and also recently at Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Ardbeg on the Isle of Islay, we were surprised by",
          "Not the cheesy tourist trap distillery tour. One of the employees takes you through the distillery from grain to Scotch. Informative and fun",
          "Our visit to the Isle of Skye and the Talisker Distillery was exceptional!! The tour was very informative and our guide Mathew was a local of the Isle of Skye and had an excellent knowledge of Talisker and the Scotch making process. I have been to other Scotch Distilleries and",
          "Roger (Tour Guide) did a fantastic job explaining the distillery history and the day to day operations. He spoke clearly and not to fast and answer questions very well. I highly recommend this tour very informative..",
          "Our tour guide, Gordon, gave us a fine tour of the distillery and hosted our tasting afterwards. We loved hearing all about how these whiskeys are produced. We had some laughs and learned a lot during our tour. It was a highlight of our trip around the Isle of Skye.",
          "A family favorite whisky so we had to go there. Not our first distillery or tour. It was a proper Skye day\u2014 pouring rain\u2014 and tours were busy and full. Good tour, although much the same as other large facilities. Our tour guide, Joe, was humorous, self effacing, and grounded.",
          "For the mistresses of Wiskey, talisker's distillery is a canned milestone. Taste, tradition and trial. You can't miss the tasting of the amazing Talisker produced in distillery",

          "I'm not much of Whiskey drinker, but when we were visiting Skye the weather wasn't on our side. While driving around the island we stopped to take the tour of the islands only distillery. For the price it was a nice informative tour, with a wee sample to finish it off. The",
          "An interesting tour but the tasting at the end consisted of one very small shot of Talisker Storm. Would've been nice to have tasted something a bit more special, that we may then have bought from the shop. The Storm and other standard stuff was more expensive than it is in",
          "My fianc\u00e9e and I did the \u00a310 tour with guide John. It was informative, interesting and well-paced. I\u2019m not a huge scotch fan, but like learning about the distilling process and how to appreciate whisky. It\u2019s a beautiful distillery with friendly staff.",
          "The Talisker distillery offers a very informative tour about the history and the process of making Scotch Whiskey. We enjoyed tasting their whiskey which has a moderate level of a \"smokey\" taste that comes from drying the malt with burning peat.",
          "Talisker was our second distillery to visit on our roadtrip through the Highlands. The distillery tour felt more \"industrialised\" and less tailored to the actual audience although very informative wrt whisky production, in comparison to other distilleries we visited this time.",
          "I came with my family in August of 2018. Our tour guide, Mary, was absolutely lovely, informative, patient and responsive. If I were just rating her as a guide she easily gets five stars. However, the distillery was crowded and they did not have enough tours to accommodate",
          "This was our first whiskey distillery tour and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The process was explained very well and by the time you taste the whiskey you can taste the different elements within it. Booked 2 months in advance and just got into the timeslot we requested, although it\u2019s",
          "We bought a couple of bottles today 19/08/18) of which 1 is a limited edition that was made by a female who worked there for around 30 years :-) We shall keep this bottle for a few years as we were told that it may be worth something due to its limited availability etc. Lovely",
          "Great tour and friendly staff. Well worth a visit and we picked up a few bits and bobs in the gift shop before we left",

          "Really nice visit of the distillery on the Isle of Skye! Staff is lovely and the whiskey amazing ! I really recommend it!",
          "Very informative tour, although only the actual distilling process is still in Carbost. The guide was knowledgeable, maybe lacking a bit of enthusiasm. Tasting was only one (very) little sample.",
          "I came here with a large group so we each got one dram and were able to sample many of Talisker's offerings. One thing to note, although their hours say 9-5, the bar doesn't open for tasting until 11 am. The bar tender was very friendly and knowledgable about whisky. I",
          "We did the classic one-hour tour and learned a lot of things. However, the tour could have been a bit more punchy : it lacked maybe small intentions that could have made this visit fantastic! If you\u2019re not willing to do the tour, the distillery just opened a bar when you can",
          "We were a bit disappointed by the tasting of Talisker in comparison to the other visits we realised before [Bowmore, Glenfiddich, Lagavulin]. It is not a matter of price [10 GPB per person] rather than quality of tour. Our guide was nice but explained everything much too fast,",
          "A very informative, well done and interesting tour of the main parts of the distillery. A great way to understand the complexity of the process of making whisky and why it's become such a big industry. We had an excelled guide, a good tasting at the end, of one of the Talisker",
          "This was a great whisky tour of the Talisker distillery. David our guide was Very informative and knowledgeable. The whisky was also great! It was very busy whenb we were there, so good idea to book in advance but beware there is no internet to do so on Skye!",
          "Finally got to go on the tour of the Distillery and was worth it. Very informative and also got to try some whiskey. Must stop at this place",
          "I\u2019ve been here twice, about 3 years apart, and loved it both times. I\u2019ve been to many distilleries and in many tours, and this one is my favorite. Granted, I am biased because it is my favorite Scotch. But, the location is just amazing and the drive out to Skye is unforgettable.",
          "A very enjoyable tour at Talisker and we found Gordon (tour guide) to be very friendly and knowledgeable. We completed the classic tour. Although I\u2019m not a whisky drinker myself I really enjoyed the tour. Thanks Gordon",
          "Very interesting experience. The guide was very kind and happy. A great first contact with scotch wisky.",
          "Very informative visitors centre that is free to enter.you only pay if you want to tour the distillery.great products to purchase of course!",
          "Very interesting tour of distillery, lead by very enthusiastic guide. Thorough explanation of procedures to achieve finished whisky.",
          "Let me begin by saying we really don't know much about whiskey, and we really don't love it. So we went in to buy a sampler for a family member, and one of the men helping us offered and set up a mini sampler since we didn't have time for the tour. He was full of information and",
          "The tour guide we had was not super enthusiastic, but this could have been a one shot experience. As a teacher I know that we all have our off days and that sometimes the enthusiasm comes from the crowd... and our group was not particularly attentive (many were not native",
          "Had a tour with John in mid-July 2018 and was a great time. Even my (non-scotch drinking - at least to that point) girlfriend enjoyed it. Very cool to tour a working distillery in such a location on the Isle of Skye and to take in all the associated smells that come along with",
          "The tour was exciting, informative and fun. It lasted roughly 45 minutes with a tasting session at the end . Tickets also included a voucher for the distillery gift shop. The tour guide was engaging and exciting whilst giving the basics to understand the distilling process, bur",
          "Our Talisker Distillery tour was good. Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly and answered all of our varied questions. We got 1 tasting with our tour, wished we could have gotten more or the ability to try additionals in the shop. Making reservations online was easy. Would",
          "I toured the distillery with 5 adult family members. Our tour guide was Georgina. She was very friendly, professional and informative. The tour was great and the process was explained with both jargon and basic terms for complete understanding. Thank you Georgina!",
          "Talister distillery was one of the better distillery tours. The guide was very knowledgeable about the whole process of maki a beautiful malt whiskey. Step by step we got to see the various stages of making a good scotch. It took around about an hour and we were all gifted with",
          "Talisker Whiskey is the only single malt whiskey in the Isle of Skye. So if you love your whiskies, this is one tour that would quench your thirst! They give a comprehensive insight to the whole production process. Ends the tour with a tasting. You are taught how to properly",
          "This was an interesting tour. You learn a lot about how whisky is made and see all the main steps. You get a taste of only one of their whiskies, however. It would have been nice to taste two different varieties. Other distilleries I\u2019ve visited in Scotland give you two",
          "Hubby and I booked a slot to visit but the weather meant we couldn't get to it as we were stranded on our boat due to bad weather. On the Sunday we went along to see if we could still have our tour. The staff were lovely and fitted us in. We really enjoyed the tour give by",
          "We did the basic tour which was informative and our guide did a very good job. At the end of the tour we were given a taste of the Talisker Storm. Compared to other basic tours we had done previously this one provided a little less information and access. Parking was not an",
          "Had a very interesting and informative tour from our guide Joe, who is a local lad to Skye. He allowed plenty time for questions and handled some pretty technical questions very well. Nice selection of good in the shop too, not just Talisker. Would definitely recommend.",
          "An interesting distillery tour covering the history of the distillery and methods of production. Has a good, well stocked shop at the end. Makes for a good wet weather day alternative for either a morning or afternoon. Seasonal opening may apply.",
          "After seeing the local car park full of camper vans and cars from around Europe, we feared our chances of the four of us squeezing into a distillery tour might be remote. However, our luck was in and we could join a tour starting in 90 minutes time. 90 minutes soon evaporated",
          "We felt the tour was a bit basic, and that they were also a little too protective. For example, we only got to quickly pop our heads into the room with the washbacks, only getting to view the warehouse through a window- things of that nature. Tour guide was friendly and",
          "We had a fabulous guided tour around the distillery. Our guide was not just really interesting to listen to but passionate about the place too, (i'm sorry to say i didn't catch his name but he said he'd been a chef). I'd always wanted to take a look around a distillery and this",
          "This was a bucket list item for me. It was a great tour. Our tour guide Rommy did a great job. We did the 2 hour tasting tour. The tasting which is the last hour is really an experience. Isle of Skye itself is a beautiful place. Really work the drive.",
          "Great tour, only \u00a310, staff are passionate, pass on a lot of interesting information and ask any questions. Shop well set out and prices are good. Worth a visit, but you will have to book in advance. Carbost is beautiful too and there is a lovely wee cafe opposite the",
          "Our tutored tasting with Roger was one of our favorite activities during our holiday in Scotland. It's worth paying the premium for this special offering. In addition to the regular tour of the distillery, the tutored tasting provides access to the roof, where you get to see the",
          "The first thing you notice when you step out of the car is the distinctive aroma of malt whiskey. The tour is absolutely worth the 10 pounds it costs. Comes with a free tasting at the end of the tour. Worth a visit.",
          "A few changes since visited in 2011 with new Visitors Centre. Good tour which well explains the distillation process and distinctive style of Talisker. Tour takes c 40 minutes and you finish with 15cl dram and opportunity to buy from the Diagio range of whisky. Costs \u00a310 to",
          "Besides the thick Scottish accent of our tour guide, the distillery tour was very interesting and informative. We got to taste one blend at the end of our tour and then browsed in the distillery shop. I was hesitating between two different bottles and the staff let me taste each",
          "Our guide Gordon did a great job in both entertaining and educating us about the whole process! Strongly recommended!",
          "If you are on Skye and have an hour to spare this is a good bet. Informative tour with our great guide Rommy. Generous tasting too. Nice little local artist community small mooring to visit if you need to wait. Loads of free parking.",
          "Excellent tour, very informative and with a generous dram to boot. Car parking good, as were services and a good visitor gift shop. Unfortunately some areas of the tour out of bounds due to cleaning but we still got the full Talisker story.",
          "Talisker is a great distillery and the only one on the Isle of Skye. They have a great variety of whiskeys some of which are only available at the distillery. There is also a nice selection of shirts and other gifts available. The tour was very good and the staff were first",
          "Sited on the coast, a traditional whisky distillery with visitor centre, good tour with guide and, of course, a tot to finish the trip off!",
          "Really interesting and informative tour, learned a lot about whisky. Samples for tasting were provided as part of the tour.",
          "My adult daughter and I took this whiskey distillery tour. It opened a whole new world for me. I hadn't realized before this that whiskey could be so delicious! A very interesting, informative tour was given by Marilyn. It was highly enjoyable.",
          "For all of the build up and attention this distillery gets the experience was disappointing. The tour was okay but they don\u2019t offer a separate tasting option which was surprising as I visited several other places that did and those interactions were a big highlight of the trip.",
          "This is the only distillery on the Isle of Skye, and worth a stop (even if you aren't a Whisky fanatic). The history provided of the area (via well thought out and interesting displays in the Gift Shop) in addition to the informational tour are worth at least a 30 minute stop",
          "Detailed and interactive tour with an opportunity at the end to try out the whiskey! Try the storm series. It is really good!",
          "Of all the scotch whiskey distilleries I had honestly never heard of Talisker before I had visited Scotland, but I am glad this is the one distillery that I visited during my trip. Not only is it a scenic drive on the Isle of Skye on the way to the distillery, but the",
          "The Distillery is amazing, whether you are a whisky lover or not it is an amazing experience. A must do on Skye.",
          "A bit of a drive to get here; it\u2019s about 45 minutes from the bridge or the ferry on Skye. At the end of a single road in a small hamlet the distillery is a large building and had s visitor center and there is a cafe nearby. Tour depart regularly and even if you didn\u2019t reserve",
          "We have been here before, and so this was just a stop off to buy some choice bottles. A great location for a distillery in a sleepy village. The last time we came we did the tour. It is very informative and you are taken through the whole distilling process from start to finish,",
          "I had long dreamt of a tour of Talisker. A chance to see the home of a decent whiskey. But there were no tastings. A tasting bar was being built but nothing available yet. There was a very limited selection of their and some other whiskeys. Staff was mediocre at best. Smiles",
          "We enjoyed our tour (given by Matthew), it was very well presented and we saw plenty of interesting things. He relayed a lot of technical scientific information pretty well. We were told about Talisker's whiskies and how to sample them. There was a slickness to the whole",
          "Having seen a few distilleries this didn't offer anything really new. Of course, sampling some whiskies was appreciated, but I think I'll head to the smaller distilleries from now on.",
          "Brilliant tour, very informative, the tour guide Kenny was very knowledgeable and was able to answer lots of extra questions we all had. Got a taste of the whiskey at the end of the tour which was a great way to round it off. Tour lasted around 45 minutes",
          "We left it too late to tour the distillery. Book in advance. However the visitor centre was very informative with good displays and the shop was well stocked with clothing and Whisky. Staff were help and friendly. The interior of the shop was a little dark and very hot. Car",
          "Went on the 2 hour distillery tour. A bit pricey but the tasting was interesting and friendly. You get a voucher when you book a tour for a discount from the store so don't forget to use it like I did for 5 GBP off. The area is quite stunning but it is a bit of a drive. Parking",
          "My husband and I toured the distillery and found it excellent. The whiskey was peat smoked and delicious!",
          "According to them it\u2019s the only distillery in Skye isle. The whisky is quite strong, lots of pepper. I am not much of a whisky guy, but it was very informative on the process of producing the malt, fermentation and distillation.",
          "Having experienced the tasting tour at Balvenie which was superb and for a similar price (circa \u00a340), we found this wanting. I think it\u2019s because Diageo centralise production, so little is actually done here. Also the malting rooms were not accessible as \u2018there\u2019d been a fire\u2019 -",
          "The distillery is located at the end of a small bay - NOT Talisker bay or beach - and the drive to it is very pleasant. It is also well-located for trips to other interesting spots on Skye, such as Glen Brittle. Great visitor centre. Great Single Malt!",
          "My husband and I visited on a rainy day last month and we are so glad we did! We were worried we wouldn\u2019t be able to get in because we didn\u2019t have a reservation but we decided to try and we got in no problem. The tour itself was quite interesting on how the process works and our",
          "Very intetesting. Whiskey made in the original way, copper still, oak casks. And thanks to Louise our tour guide.",
          "Great tour and not that expensive. You don\u2019t need to be a whisky drinker to appreciate the process needed to produce the best in the world. Staff very friendly and Gordon was a very genial tour guide.",
          "We booked our \u201cfriends of the single malts\u201d tour and thanks that we did book it because they were so busy when we arrived! The tour and the tasting were great, we enjoyed!!!",
          "Nice gift shop, ok tour and a really mediocre (stingy) tasting. But it\u2019s the only distillery on the island so, why not? Nice facility, views and a great whiskey...we just didn\u2019t taste any.",
          "Even on a weekday tours sold out. I dive an hour out of my way and missed out on the tours. Fair warning that the road is steep and narrow, not to mention in poor condition.",
          "At the beautiful Skye a very nice distillery. We had a tour from a very enthousiastic guide with a lot of knowledge about the Talisker whisky proces. A must do!",
          "The distillery is well worth a visit. There\u2019s a lot you can learn, I found it a bit complicated, in som parts you could not hear was being said because of the noise. As always the shops where very expensive. They get very busy, Mack shore you book early.",
          "If you are into highland whisky this is on the must visit list if you are on Skye. Not particularly easy to get to and with limited parking the overwhelming impression of the distillery is of being overwhelmed with tourists. The shop and exhibition area was packed and tours",
          "Our guide on the tour was very knowledgeable about all aspects of the Whisky making business and made the tour fascinating. Her Scottish sense of humour provided a ray of sunshine in an otherwise rainy day. We had toured several distilleries earlier on our trip but the Talisker",
          "Booked tickets on line a while ago so that we could visit when we wanted to, on our day on Skye. They are well geared up for these tours and the place was really quite busy. Our guide was professional and enthusiastic though I did feel that we were being rushed along because of",
          "My wife and I planned a last minute trip to Skye since we needed some time away. I've travelled up to Islay in the past because I love scotch. My wife is less of a scotch fan, and so Skye seemed to fit the bill. I would get to visit Talisker, and we would be able to enjoy the",
          "Fantastic tour the guide was very knowledgeable and whisky tasted beautiful took a few boxes home you must visit the put up the road",
          "Arguably the most picturesque location of any distillery in Scotland, on the banks of Loch Harport, and with friendly tour guides and fascinating machinery and processes. I've tasted Talisker in Britain and in Europe, but it never tastes quite like it does here, where it's made.",
          "Tour of Talker Distillery - very interesting and very informative. Tasted samples of single malt and learnt new ways of tasting whisky.",
          "Took a chance that we may find a tour to join. No. No space for walk-up guests. There's more interest in an airport duty free shop than in the on site shop here. Zero is visible without the tour... just a room with some static imagery. No kit. No tasting options. No",
          "The distillery is in a great location and is very popular. Even at quiet times it is a good idea to book ahead. The tour (in May 18) costs \u00a310 per person which I thought was a bit steep given the stingy tasting.. Photography is not allowed on the tour inside the distillery. The",
          "Great visit with our guide Gordon who is a funny guy. Superb location. The coffee shop in front (Caora Dhubh, see my other review) serves the best coffee in Scotland. Since there is a lot less distilleries on Skye than in the Speyside, it can be busy. Groups of visit seemed",
          "Joe gave a really clear, fun ans informative tour. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. He gave very full, detailed responses to our questions and we learnt a great deal and had a great time. We also appreciated the discount given n the shop too! Well worth the fee and the",
          "We took the tour with a guy that looked like a young Sean Connery. He was quite informative and could answer any and all questions. While I really liked the tour, I wasn't crazy about their whiskey. It wasn't my palette. However, if you like a \"peaty or smokey\" whiskey...you",
          "Is Talisker the only company who can afford to have so poor visit booking system ? Seems to be so.. Not able to book using iPAD nor PC..",
          "This is a good distillery with a decent amount to learn as you go through the tour. Our tour guide was Joe - he was informative, funny and good at his job. He took us through the process easily, making everything very simple and easy to understand. The distillery itself is",
          "Really nice very traditional distillery. Our guide was brilliant, very knowledgeable and very clearly walked us through the distilling process.. Lovely dram at the end too. Great value tour, highly recommended!",
          "Excellent length of tour and size of group, with opportunities to view the action close up and lots of opportunities to ask questions. I enjoyed the fact that the guide didn't skimp on the science aspect - some other tours I've been on have glossed over the specific chemicals",
          "This tour is well worth the time. Our guide was thorough and informative. I personally learned much of the process and in turn gained a real appreciation for the effort to produce a fine \"single malt.\" Even the \"tasting\" at the end was very informative.",
          "We did the first tour on May 8 and our guide was very knowledgeable and pedagogical. Altogether it was an interesting experience which should be greatly enriched once the tasting bar opens, providing they won\u2019t just serve cocktails but do proper whisky tasting.",
          "Visited here with friends during a trip around Scotland. This was our fifth distillery in four days, so we did not do the tour. We did, however, sample the wares. The staff was quite accommodating in allowing us samples of the offerings we were considering for purchase. In",
          "When you arrive at the Talisker Distillery you can actually smell the scotch in the air! It is wonderful! We went on a tour with a great guide, his name is Eric. He was a visiting tour guide from another distillery and was very knowledgeable about the process. You could tell how",
          "From all the distilleries we've visited this one is in my top 3. Great tour, lovely guide with good explanations and good whisky. Highly recommended.",
          "It was a lovely trip! We chose it as a stormy day alternative, but the time there was well spent. Friendly staff, informative tour in an almost familiar atmosphere. Nice whiskey shop attached.",
          "I have not been to Talisker for 15 years so thought it was time to have another visit. The Guide was very informative and very knowledgeable about the history, the distilling process and the actual Whiskeys. The tour lasts approx 1hour with a taste of Talisker at the end. There",
          "We were there at 9.45 meaning they were just open. You would guess that there is a large chance you'll be able to get a tour. But the first tour was already full the day before. I found that disappointing and since we were travelling the island, we just bought a bottle and left.",
          "Get here very early if you plan to get food up the hill at The Oyster shed. The line can be long and slow moving. Extra parking towards the back. No photography on the tour, but very knowledgable guides. Friendly staff. Great taste testing at the end. Airplane protection travel",
          "Myself, my wife, Mother-In-Law & her partner visited the Talisker Distillery for a tour during a day trip to the Isle Of Skye. The tour was very good, perfect for those wanting a comprehensive overview of how single malt is produced. The only thing stopping this being a five",

          "Have visited several distilleries throughout Scotland with my husband who loves his whiskey.. this trip to talisker converted me to drinking whiskey. The tour guide was originally from Columbia was excellent (can't rem her name)..she explained everything and answered questions",
          "A very welcoming facility followed by an informative and well run tour. The guides (this was my second visit) are a bit scripted/robotic but they are professional. While this was 'dad's' stop, the kids kept attention fairly well. A nice tasting at the end as well. Great stop.",
          "On the NC500 tour, we took a day to see Skye and Talisker is a better rated Scottish distillery. We sampled and took back the Storm, 10 year and Sea pack and after enjoying them went back the next day for the same. Lovely little distillery.",
          "This was our fourth visit of a Distillery in Scotland. We booked a basic tour which lasted about an hour or so. The tour itself was very informative and the guide (joe?) was very knowing. The Distillery is quite modern. These in comparison to other visited Distilleries. A bit",
          "Fascinating one hour tour of the distillery with Joe which included whisky tasting at the end. \u00a310 but when you purchase a bottle of Talisker Whisky you get \u00a35 discount. Great shop and friendly staff. Free parking. Do go and visit it is an experience.",
          "We visited the distillery to take a tour and then buy some ofvthe goods. We were booked on to the 12:30 tour and due to a prebooked party of 12 not turning up we got the tour all to ourselves which was fab. Michaela was our guide, she was from a sister distillery and was there",
          "A nice tour of this working distillery. The tour guide was both charming and knowledgeable. The 5 pound voucher helps to off set the somewhat high shop prices at the end of the tour.",
          "Having visited all the Islay distilleries, and a few on mainland Scotland, I'm well used to the spiel and setup of distillery tours, and know the regular patter. On a trip to Skye with friends we decided to swing into Talisker to tick another distillery off the list -",
          "Talisker is my wife's favorite, so this was high on our list. We had visited 7 distilleries before Talisker, so we were looking forward to saving the best for last. Unfortunately, it was the biggest disappointment. Upon entering, we couldn't find the tasting bar that even the",

          "Beautiful drive across Skye to get here, arrived a few minutes late for a pre-booked tour on 2 April but were accommodated, guide was knowledgable and had to contend with a range of knowledge and languages so did a good job. We didn't get our discount vouchers on the way in and",

          "Gordon was a friendly and considerate guide, who showed us around. The talk was accessible to all and he included my kids. But the distillery is very sterile in its appearance and areas not accessible. This is the first one I've been to where you don't get to go into the",
          "I am visiting Skye on holiday and while sightseeing I went to the Talisker Distillery in Carbost. I enjoyed tasting the Talisker Storm at the end of the tour as I enjoy Peaty Whiskies. Our Tour Guide, Michaela was very knowledgeable and informative despite having told us that",
          "I'm not a fan of whiskey, but my husband is, which is why we went. I wasn't expecting it to be any good, but it really was! Very informative tour (well worth the price - \u00a310 each) and really interesting to go around the distillery - husband was happy with the drink at the end :)",
          "Visited the talisker distillery today, had a nice tour with Joe who was great. Had a dram afterwards in the tasting room. I even had a sample of their special bottle. Gave out a nice Talisker pin which was a bonus.",

          "While on Skye but was rude note to visit the distillery. The guided tour is worth a walk around plus the little tasting at the end. When busy you might have to wait till then next tour but don't be put off by it. There is a little coffee shop across from the carpark for a quick",
          "We arrived on a very rainy day to take the tour... But everyone also had the same idea so we had to wait 3 hours to get booked on the next available tour, we took refuge in the local pub! The tour was conducted by Nick and he was very knowledgable and I interesting host. A wee",

Plan ahead and don\u2019t get shut out. We were lucky and happened to have Louise as our tour guide \u2014",
          "Frankly disappointed and disgusted at the reception at this distillery. Called up to book a tour and ask if we could come in just for a tasting, which we were told we could. When we turned up they said actually they didn\u2019t do tastings without a tour (which was full) as they",
          "I am not the whisky buff in the family, my husband and boys are,so distillery tours have been clone like till now. Second time at Talisker.Loved every minute of our tour. Our guide,Gordon was simply the best. It was so great to have a local Scottish guide who engaged with",
          "We had the classic tour which was very informative and fun. It started on time which was another plus. To the end we were given just a wee dram of scotch tasting. Your ticket will allow you 5\u00a3 of at the gift shop. However this is only for drinks of 70cl Which are the big bottles",

          "Worth taking an hour out to visit during a trip to Skye. The lady who took our \u00a310, 45 minute tour was very interesting and pleasant. My husband said the whisky was delicious. There is a nice short loch side walk across the road. Thank you",
          "Take the distillery tour and then sample some of the whiskey. Very informative tour, best in small group. Would have liked to sample a variety not just one (other tours we have been on typically gave three samples). Best to book ahead if you prefer a particular time in busy",

Next day I found the same bottle of whisky in a small village shop on the island",

          "Surely can recommend the tour and the place. We had a great tour, led by Fleur. Very informative tour and a very knowledgable and always smiling tour lead who ensures to get an answer to any question. Many thanks again.",
          "You have to go there. Smell the sea and the Whisky.",
          "Slightly mismanaged visitor experience. We called in the morning to reserve 4 places on their 4pm tour. They said they had 3 spots so couldn\u2019t accommodate all 4 of us. In fact they didn\u2019t want to sell out the last tour of the day, so they \u2026",
          "Stopped by the visitor center despite the distillery/tour being closed due to the quiet month. Very worthwhile! Informative, friendly and very helpful staff inside to help talk you through the various bottles they offer. Delicious! Tastings \u2026",
          "We went here hoping to do a tour but the wait was 1.5 hours. Instead, we bought a flight of 3 whiskys and a few extras! In the end we were happy we didn\u2019t pay for the tour but spent money on the bottles to take home instead!\nGreat little coffee place outside.",
          "Pleasant tour of the distillery showing the process and what is unique to Talisker",
          "Didn\u2019t take the tour but the shop sold a varied range of whisky at different price points to suit all. Sadly, we are flying back to London with only hand luggage so couldn\u2019t buy a large bottle. Be aware, very busy at the weekend with tourists.",
          "Visited the distillery today and was very impressed by the distillery itself and the tour, which was brought to life by our guide, Nick. Having done a few distillery tours in the past, I thought I knew a lot about whisky making. However, \u2026",
          "I now have a new appreciation for whisky after visiting Talisker Distillery. Nick was a great host.",
          "Nice visitor center with a gift shop where you can buy all standard bottlings, some non standard ones and a lot of other merch. Went also for Talisker Tasting where we had nice tour of the distillery which ended up in tasting on new make and five expressions of Talisker. Highly recommended if you like their whisky.",
          "Visit of the distillery was nice, think it lasted the right amount of time (just under an hour I believe).",
          "Compared to other distillery tours, this one was merely OK. The tour guide was nice enough, but did not seem deeply knowledgeable. At the end, we did not even get a full dram of one whisky, when other tours often provided at least two \u2026",
          "Recommended visit if you're travelling to Skye.",
          "Fantastic place, great whiskies and you can taste in the bar almost all of them. \nGo ahead and Make the visit if you don't know anything about whisky. \nIf you have strong knowledge and want to explore more deeply, maybe the visit in summer is not sufficient enough...",
          "Talisker distillery is an Island single malt Scotch whisky distillery based in Carbost, Scotland on the Isle of Skye. The distillery is operated by Diageo, and is marketed as part of their Classic Malts series. The brand is sold as a premium whisky.",
          "for my taste one of the best scottish whiskey, give it a go and try some of their special editions (sold only at the place) - worth it... also very nice destillery even though it's little bit crowded",
          "You DO need to book.\n+ \u00a341 Bottle here is available 450 miles away for \u00a335?",
          "Excellent tour of the distillery with our guide Lorna, in this Beautiful distillery. At the end we tested Taliskers Storm whisky, which I highly recommend. It's a good segway into peated whisky. \n\nRecommended!",
          "We had an excellent visit.  Tour was okay.  Be aware the free dram with tour is a tasting not a drink.  We went ahead and got 2 nice drams of our choosing at a fair price.  Staff in the gift shop were very helpful and polite.  Went the extra effort to find something not on the shelf. If you are in this part of Skye, a must visit.",
          "The tasting was free and the whiskey excellent.",
          "I had never tasted a whiskey that featured tasting items like \u201csalty\u201d and \u201coily.\u201d  So I had to try some. \n\nI enjoyed the distillery and the tastings, but this isn\u2019t the scotch I\u2019d buy and then keep in my collection or try to get back to the States. The history of the operation was, frankly, more interesting.",
          "Very nice distillery with friendly people. We went to the whisky and chocolate tour for \u00a330 each and had a great time. You get to walk through most of the distillery rooms with lots of opportunities to ask questions and then a tasting of 3 whiskies with paired chocolates afterwards. Can definitely recommend this.",
          "Small, but great location and really nice shop and tasting room.",
          "didnt get the chance to do the tour whilst there, but the talisker storm is absolutely one of the best scotches to suit my pallette",
          "This was our first visit to any of the distilleries in Scotland. Standard fee for the tour. No booking is required but highly recommended to ensure there is room as this is a very busy spot for tours. We were showed and told most everything \u2026",
          "Would highly recommend a visit when on Skye. Was able to get a same day tour which was very interesting and well priced.",
          "Great distillery we didn\u2019t do the tour as we have seen many others. Shop was well set up and purchased a limited bottle. \nTry the coffee shop across the road best coffee in Scotland.",
          "Our party of six had a terrible experience at Talisker. We arrived at 3:45 to take the tour, have some drinks at the bar and buy take away bottles. The posted hours are open until 5:00. \nUpon arrival we\u2019re informed tours are sold out. \u2026",
          "Well worth a detour. One of the better distillery tours I\u2019ve been to, well organised, knowledgeable guides and an opportunity to sample all 12 whiskeys offered by Talisker.",
          "Great place to visit, it was so much fun. The staff are super friendly and they know their whiskey. The gift shop was lovely and getting the talisker pins at the end of the tour way lovely. Even the bar area was nice and it has the history of talisker written around the edge. Great visit!",
          "Interesting destillery tour with an excellent guide.",
          "We didn't get there to experience a tour, but that was fine for us! The entire staff we interacted with was so kind and friendly, I'm sure the tour would have been great! However, we did take a walk around the area and learned a lot about \u2026",
          "Very friendly staff, stylish tasting bar and shop.",
          "Good collection for sale and tasting.",
          "Tour is quite average. They do not do malting here, so it starts from milling. At the end, you do not get into the warehouse, but just glance through the glass wall. Nothing special as tour. Not many distillery have malting or bottling \u2026",
          "Having visited quite a few distilleries in Scotland over the past period, we picked the standard tour including one dram at the end. \n\nThe tour was packed with 16 participants, other distilleries often stop at a maximum of 12. Our guide was \u2026",
          "Talisker is my first bottle of scotch and the reason why I fall in love with it. Coming to isle of skye and into the Carbost town to see first Talisker sign was a dream come true moment. We walked in for the \u00a310 tour for those you missed \u2026",
          "Pretty decent shop and beautiful exterior. When we arrived we were informed that the bar was closed and wouldn't be opened until next week. I was shopping for a friend so I still bought the distillers special edition. Talisker, while making some pretty decent whiskey still has some ways to go in my opinion.",
          "Interesting guided tour. Our only whiskey distillery visit, so can't compare. Shop is overpriced, even with voucher from the tour.",
          "A bit pricey. You can find the same whiskey (Talisker 10 year) in the Tesco in Fort Williams for cheaper. Also cheaper at the airport (because VAT is so high in Europe). I'd suggest people just buy the whiskey they want at the airport unless you're looking for a more exclusive bottle.",
          "Beautiful bay, overlooked by stunning cliffs.",
          "Tried the Talisker Tasting Tour. One of my best tasting experiences by far.",
          "We arrived today during the silent season and were initially disappointed to realise full tours were not available but Duncan went out of his way to show us the warehouse and provide a detailed explanation of the distillation process. The \u2026",
          "One of the best, no doubt! I bought from them a small bottle very well done packaged and I really enjoyed it! After this, I've added the paper from the very small box of the bottle to an artwork that I was made then... It looks very good, \u2026",
          "Great set up and atmosphere. Huge selection of Talisker in their shop!",
          "Wonderful experience. Very nice staff.",
          "Excellent tour covering most of the production process well and very clearly (I say most because Diageo distilleries seem lighter on the info and are inexplicably more secretative than  others in my experience). Tasting at the end pushing \u2026",
          "Great tour with John who was so knowledgeable and witty. Only issue was the ladies toilets. 4 cubicles 2 with broken locks other 2 had no toilet paper. Not great.",
          "Really good visit & tour of the 200 year old brewery. The smells & tastes were wonderful ! Really loved the gift shop & of course the surrounding country side was magnificient! 6 stars!",
          "Interesting distillery with knowledgeable staff and superb whisky!",
          "A very interesting, detailed tour with a very knowledgeable guide which is worth doing. Great gift shop with a wide selection of various whiskies. Staff were very friendly.",
          "I love Talisker, so was disappointed to find that this tour was fairly bland as distillery tours go. No significant discounts in the shop, and the included tasting was just a 10cl measure of Talisker Storm",
          "It was a very up and down experience for me. I love whiskey and learning the history of each place and what goes into the process for each place. As for here it has a Smokey and Spicy taste so this whiskey is not for everyone. The tour was \u2026",
          "Did a classic tour that shows you around the distillery and gives you a taste of a whiskey at the end.\n\nThis is a must do on Skye if you are in to your whiskey or not.",
          "Super busy, decent drink.",
          "Not my favourite Scotch whisky but it was a great tour. Very interesting and informative.",
          "Visited the gift shop on weds 3 oct and bought a bottle of Talisker Skye @ \u00a341 . On drive back to hotel we stopped off at Broadford co-op and saw they had a massive stock of Talisker Skye on offer at \u00a325 a bottle.  Not happy . .feel like i been mugged !",
          "This place is a total rip off! I would not recommend buying any whisky there without googling supermarket prices first! Bought Talisker Sky and Storm at the shop only to find out that the Waitrose was selling the same bottles \u00a315 and \u00a310 \u2026",
          "Nice distillay, free samples, friendly staff. Small charge for the tour, the gift shop has some interesting informative things to look at. Worth a drop in.",
          "my family enjoy a good whiskey and whilst they had enjoyed many whiskey distilleries around Scotland, this was the least enjoyable as the staff there weren't very polite and had no intentions of serving us. the place only had 2 other \u2026",
          "For any whisky enthusiast,  there's no question about whether to visit Talisker, only when.  During the busy seasons make sure to book in advanced as it can quickly fill up. Guides around the distillery are knowledgeable and definitely \u2026",
          "Booked a tour by phone the day before. The tour was alright, nothing special. They do not store or bottle on site, they ship it to the mainland for that. With the tour we received a 5 pound rebate on a full size bottle. I thought the Storm was far too smoky, we bought the Skye instead.",
          "One of my favorite whiskeys so a stop at Talisker was a must.  The location is breathtaking and the tour what we expected.  Enjoyed the tasting room and being the only distillery on the Isle of Skye it is worth a visit.  The staff was very \u2026",
          "Tour guide was good but only got to sample one type of their whiskey. The gift shop/ticket area was slow and not overly friendly unlike most the people we have come across in Scotland.",
          "A great tour in a production factory. Our guide, Mike, was very friendly and answered all questions the group had.",
          "Visited here last March and very much enjoyed the tour. Informative and ending with a quick taster. Just called in recently to buy a bottle of their Talisker Storm.",
          "We had the classic distillery tour and it was okay.\nThe tour itself was rather pricey, 10\u00a3 but you get a 5\u00a3 coupon, you may apply on any of the standard sized whisky bottles in the shop. We learned a lot about whisky, but the little gulp of \u2026",
          "\u00a38 for a 45 minute tour;  which I felt  was good value. Lots of facts about whisky that I didn't know; worth visiting if you have an interest in whisky. The Oyster Shed is a few minutes walk along the road and is well worth a visit to round things off.",
          "This was probably one of the most disappointing distillery tour I had in Scotland. Don't get me wrong, this has nothing to do with our tour guide, but rather the lack of staffs working there in the gift shop area and the tour as a whole. \u2026",
          "We had a great experience today taking a tour around Talisker Distillery, Skye. Our tour guide, Joe, was fantastic! His knowledge and enthusiasm for the product really showed. He was professional throughout, even when a tour group turned up \u2026",
          "This was honestly the most underwhelming 'tasting' experience l have ever been to. There was absolutely no welcome to speak of, the 'greeting' staff came across as very disinterested, were incredibly unhelpful and l found it unusual that a \u2026",
          "Nice relaxed distillery tour with an entertaining guide, as well the full tasting we did (10 yrs, 57 north, 25 year e.g.). Relatively large gift shop. Smells nice already at the parking lot! The Old Inn is a good alternative for staying nearby.",
          "Great tour with good whisky. While the normal your only allows you to taste one whisky, you can ask to sample more. A must see if you like peaty whisky. ",
          "Worthwhile tasting tour. Booked ahead. Sat in a lovely room with 6 options. Had an hour to taste and chat.",
          "Great tour and very friendly staff.",
          "A very good tour guide showed us around - for a fairly reasonable price. Some very interesting smells in and around the distillery! We didn't book but didn't have to wait too long - we nipped up the road for a quick coffee at the pub while we waited. ",
          "Great whisky as I always loved their whiskey and bought 5 bottles especially the distillery bottling only is not available else where. But their staff does not seem interested in helping or want to show off their whisky.  Definitely not welcoming.",
          "I thought the tour, facts and explanations were ok, but where is the love? After the tour found that we were supposed to have been given a voucher to apply against purchases. Presumably missed because we were late due to a diversion. Abrupt \u2026",
          "Very disappointing!The staff (Mr Gordon) was really not nice and actually rude. I was translating for my friend (low voice) but this was distracting him so he asked me not to  translate. We try to wait when he finished and then briefly \u2026",
          "We previously signed up for the friends program, so this tour was free.  That said, the tour has good value, and is quite interesting. The tasting room in particular has great atmosphere and decoration. If you like peaty scotch, this is a \u2026",
          "The shop is a way too expensive. Buy the whisky at your home supermarket, a way cheaper.\nHow can a whisky be more expensive at the distillery than a shop ?",
          "We called in advance and clearly stated we would be driving in from a long distance (more than 100 miles) and we would be interested in an afternoon tour. We were asked if we had a tour booking already, and we said No; but the distillery \u2026",
          "We came all the way from Fort William to visit the distillery. Due to bad weather and to much people no tours were available. This is impernitent. No words.",
          "The distillery whisky tour was the 3rd one for me and I got information more than  the others. The tour guide (if I'm not making a mistake his name is Chris) was very helpful and he was the guy who told us we can get a whisky passport with \u2026",
          "Such a nice distillery. Great tour with a guide in english who explains the whole process of making whisky. The tasting tour will give you the chance to taste a lot of different whisky and end with a very good (and expensive) one. In my case it was a 25 years old. I would  recommend you to visit if you're passing on isle of skye.",
          "Spectacular location.  The tour was great and our guide Ian was informative and funny.  Such a treat to visit here after enjoying their whisky for years.",
          "Whisky here is great, offering some very nice smoky/peated whiskies from the Scottish isles. Big bummer with the tasting room is that there is absolutely no seating and they don't offer formal tastings. Why would someone drive all the way \u2026",
          "Could not get a tour because fully booked.  Now I was kind of disappointed that they seem to book in advance so if you turn up on the day you'll be unlikely to get a tour.  This seems unusual to book in advance but I guess it helps them being quite remote.  However seemed a nice place.  The Old Inn pub just up the way, 10/10 :D",
          "Well worth the visit and doing the tour, especially if you are a member of the Classic malt association which gets you on the tour for free. Can get incredibly busy as most attractions on Skye do.",
          "The guided tour through the distillery is ok, but mostly nothing special if you already have seen ans other distillery or a brewery (quite the same procedure just without destillation on the end).\nThe tasting just includes 2 cl of one kind of Whisky, which is not that much as they are producing more than 10 different blends.",
          "The visit to the distillery was interesting to understand how a whisky is made. The guide was clear but imho was a really fast visit. Disappointing the taste session, with just only one whisky. A comparison between other whiskies would be \u2026",
          "After completing the Cullin Ridge we limped our way around the distillery the following day which was thoroughly enjoyed. We purchased a bottle from the store at the end of the tour then bought some steak and a portable BBQ before crashing \u2026",
          "Interesting tour through the Taslisker Distillery taking you up close to all parts of the whisky creation process. You can see, hear and smell each of the different stages! To finish there is a small tasting of the Talisker Storm whisky. Of \u2026",
          "One of Scotland's finest distilleries. \n\nWell worth visiting if you have the opportunity to do so.",
          "Not worthy to pay \u20ac 8 for tour. \nExplaination given by staff was very good though.\nYou may enjoy, If yoy really want to know about malting and whisky making.\nEnd of the tour, They give you whisky to taste. ",
          "Does not feel like a scotch",
          "Talisker is a favorite whisky so I was probably pre-disposed to really enjoy this tour. I found the tour to be informative and the guide very friendly and at ease with questions she had probably heard 1000 times before.  This is a must-do for any visit to Skye.  I agree with another reviewer, the shop was overpriced.",
          "Worth the drive out to Carbost for a very informative tour of the distillery. Obviously an excellent selection of Talisker whiskies to buy but they also have some great merchandise (the round-bottomed tumblers are particularly nice).",
          "Great tour and history of the distillery! Highly recommended! A must visit in Skye! As for the friends of the classic malts passport and transport yourself to an adventure of discovering new single malts across Scotland!  ",
          "Great tour delivered in an informative and relaxed manner by Katie who answered lots of questions from the group. Really great whiskey which is samples at the end of the short tour which is a bargain at \u00a38.",
          "I'd never been to a whiskey distillery before, and thoroughly enjoyed the tour. \nWe opted for the shorter tour, without the full tasting experience. It was very interesting, and the lady taking us round was very knowledgable, answering all \u2026",
          "A good whisky tour. The guide was very thorough. The visitor centre is nice.",
          "A day in May it was way too crowded to really enjoy the place - it was raining so that may have drove more inside...  Really the worst distillery experience of a dozen so far...  Their whisky I still enjoyed just better at a bar or home who friends.",
          "Interesting tour of the distillery. Recommend calling ahead to book as people were being turned away when we were there. If you sign up online in advance as a 'friend of the malts' (google it), the tour and tasting is free. The tastings are \u2026",
          "I really enjoyed the tour, but we very nearly missed it. Booking really is essential. I'm not a fan of whisky but the place smelled incredible and I really liked seeing the process of making the whisky.",
          "With Talisker being one of my favourite whiskies, the tour was a must visit for me on the Isle of Skye. The tour was quite interesting. It was 2014 when we went now, so this may have changed, but it'd be nice if there was a caf\u00e9 or some \u2026",
          "Excellent tour - a must do if you're on Skye! It can get busy, so either book ahead - or book a time while you're there and grab a meal or pint at the Old Inn across the street (if you tell the kitchen your tour time, they'll accommodate).",
          "The tours are well done and informative. Our tour guide, Nick, was friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The tour included a small taste of their Talisker Storm with a short discussion regarding some tasting notes. Your tour ticket, which costs GBP10 includes a GBP5 coupon towards the purchase of a bottle of scotch. ",
          "I think it was the best distillery tour that I have been on. They all share the same elements but I liked that they used a microphone on the more noisy floors.",
          "Great Whiskey tasting, lovely setting",
          "Not much of a whiskey drinker.\nHad quite a knowledgeable tour on the distillery.\nCourteous staff and well maintained , placed just on the coast, a few geo caches also present around the distillery. Good fun, all in all",
          "Nice though quite touristy. I could happily stand outside and inhale the smell all day. Tour is free if you previously signed up to Diagio's Classic Malts Club. Tastings are free.",
          "Frankly disappointed and disgusted at the reception at this distillery. Called up to book a tour and ask if we could come in just for a tasting, which we were told we could. When we turned up they said actually they didn\u2019t do tastings \u2026",
          "One of The best",
          "The short Tour is ok but a bit explained in automatic mode, avoid the questions and run. The possibility to buy whiskey is present but why would you do that if prices at home are comparable.",
          "Our tour and tasting was great. Totally worth the trip. If you love smoky scotch don't miss out on this. ",
          "It's in the middle of nowhere.. the drive to the distillery from Portree is quite scenic. Their Talisker Storm is a must try.",
          "Nice Distillery - very nice tour and guides",
          "Tour was grand... not worth a tenner though. Still, the place is pretty cool.",
          "interesting and friendly staff",
          "Great distillery with friendly, knowledgeable staff. It is open on Sundays in the summer, our tour was fun and the whiskey is top notch!",
          "Great tour, fantastic (but strong) whisky",
          "Nice tour with knowledgeable female guide who dealt with the 2 Germans, who kept taking pictures after repeatedly being told not to, well. Shop a tad expensive given supermarket prices but a good range of whiskeys. ",
          "Can't comment on the tour,  the building seems nice and well presented staff very nice and polite (they were taking my money!). However whilst the whisky leaves nice peaty taste in my mouth (Talisker Storm) it is clearly and enterprise \u2026",
          "Great tour and a darn tasty whiskey to be had here. Definitely worth a stop while in Skye. ",
          "Been here 5 times as it's my husband favourite whisky and the tour is great.  ",
          "Great place, great whiskey. Our tour guide Laura was  really good of maintaining the atmosphere and explaining the process from harvesting to a bottle of whiskey.",
          "Wow was this a waste of money! We came expecting to learn something special about Talisker, and its history. All our monotonous, dull tour guide told us was about the basics of whiskey making. I could've read that for free on Wikipedia! Plus, \u00a38 for one small dram of whiskey? No thanks! Save your money folks!",
          "Great gift shop and helpful staff, but very busy, and tours have to be booked way up front. If you just show up, you will be disappointed.",
          "If you live Talisker whiskey this is a must visit.  Tours are good, Gift shop is small but nice.",
          "When we came as family, we also had to wait 45 minutes, even though you wouldn't think about a high period of tourism end of September. So that's the reason why I take 1 star away.\nThe rest was ok. For each bottle, they gave us \u00a3 5 cheaper \u2026",
          "Great and knowledgeable staff. Amazing tour being able to see the classic methods being used.",

          "Friendly and helpful staff. Nice gift shop.",
          "Terrible staff & service. \nWe went as a group of friends, three couples to be precise and couldn't actually take the tour because we were treated terribly at the front desk. We got to the distillery with a lot of excitement and rushed to \u2026",

          "Good factory tour. Nice guys.",
          "Very informative tour, felt really brief but lasted an hour and included lots of information. The visitors centre and the shop are very cosy; the range of whisky available is not impressive, though would satisfy anyone visiting on a casual \u2026",
          "Very rude and arrogant staff. We couldn't take a tour it was fully booked, that can happen but we were disappointed after a 3 hour drive just to visit talisker. When we asked if we could wait around to see if someone cancels or doesn't show \u2026",
          "This was my second distillery tour, after the Scapa Distillery on Orkney. While Talisker is bigger, the processes and equipment you see are pretty much identical, but the tour at Scapa was much more interesting and \"intimate\" -- there were \u2026",
          "Had a nice tour, but a bit too touristy. Too many people in my opinion.",
          "Poor tour. English speaking not polite guide without any wish to make foreigners understand even if we paid standard ticket (8\u00a3 each), describes a too simple process: Talisker declares 2,600,000 litres of pure alcohol per year, which means \u2026",

        "wiki": "Skye Live Festival is an annual two-day music festival taking place at The Lump, the traditional home of the Skye Highland Games, in Portree on the Isle of Skye in Scotland.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe festival was established in 2015 with organisers hoping to \"fill the void\" left by the since defunct Isle of Skye Music Festival. The first year's festival featured one stage, with performances from DJs on the Friday and bands on the Saturday. Bands appearing including Skye's own Peatbog Faeries, Donnie Munro and Niteworks, with DJs includingAndrew Weatherall and Hot Chip on the Friday night..In 2016, the festival changed sites to the King George V Park in Portree, with a view to expanding capacity and offering to two stages.. It featured performances from Public Service Broadcasting, Capercaillie, Treacherous Orchestra, Bicep_(duo), Simian Mobile Disco and more. \nWhile the 2016 location enabled a greater capacity, organisers felt it lacked the \"iconic\" status of the original site and so returned in 2017, while retaining a second stage, hosted by the Apocathery Tower overlooking Portree Harbour. The festival was headlined by Mercury Prize nominees Django Django. The festival was a critical success, declared \"a unique and essential festival experience\".The festival's 2018 edition featured performances from Session A9, Denis Sulta, Pictish Trail and other.The festival's dates for 2019 have been confirmed as Friday 6 & Saturday 7 September, with the Niteworks and the Peatbog Faeries the first artists to be announced for the festival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.skyelive.co.uk/",

          "Went here for the Skye Highland Games and loved the intimacy of the venue - I could see everything from the one spot. Great viewpoint for the harbour and surrounding scenery",

Well worth the walk. Either from the hospital or via a path starting near the old Courthouse.",

        "wiki": "Angus M\u00f2r MacAskill (1825 \u2013 8 August 1863) was a Scottish-born Canadian giant. The 1981 Guinness Book of World Records says he is the tallest non-pathological giant in recorded history (7 ft 9 in, or 2.36 m) and had the largest chest measurements of any non-obese man (80 inches, or 200 cm).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMacAskill was born on the Isle of Berneray in the Sound of Harris, Scotland. His father was Norman MacAskill, who was 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) tall, and his mother was Christina Campbell. He had twelve siblings, several of whom died young, and he was an ordinary-sized baby.  After several years in Stornoway, Outer Hebrides, the family settled in the fishing community of Englishtown, Cape Breton Island, around 1831.Young MacAskill was said to be of normal stature, but in entering his adolescence he began to grow rapidly and by his 20th year had attained 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m), eventually reaching 7 ft 9 in (2.36 m) within another year or two. His early adult weight was 425 pounds (193 kg). His shoulders were 44 inches (110 cm) wide, and the palm of his hand 8 inches (20 cm) wide and 12 inches (30 cm) long; his wrists were 13.5 inches (34 cm) in circumference; his ankles measured 18 inches (46 cm) in circumference; by 1863 he was wearing boots 17.5 inches (44 cm) long. His feet were probably around 16 inches long and 8 inches wide. He had deep-set blue eyes, a musical, if somewhat hollow voice and a mild and pleasant manner. Despite his size he was well proportioned.He was known in his home community of St. Ann's as \"Gille M\u00f2r\" (translated to \"Big Boy\"). He was also known to many as the \"Cape Breton Giant\" or simply \"Giant MacAskill.\"\nWhen MacAskill was approximately 14 years old he travelled on a fishing schooner from St. Ann's to North Sydney and the crew took him along to a dance.  An altercation with a dancer led to  MacAskill striking his tormentor's jaw with his fist. The man landed in the middle of the floor and was unconscious for so long the other dancers thought he was dead. When the captain returned to his schooner he found MacAskill on his knees praying that he had not killed the man.\n\n\n== Adult career ==\nMacAskill was well known for feats of strength such as lifting a ship's anchor weighing 2,800 pounds (1,300 kg) to chest height, and an ability to carry barrels weighing over 350 pounds (160 kg) apiece under each arm or reputedly able to lift a hundredweight (50 kg) with two fingers and hold it at arm's length for ten minutes.In 1849 he entered show business and went to work for P.T. Barnum's circus, appearing next to General Tom Thumb.  In 1853 he toured the West Indies and Cuba. Queen Victoria heard stories about MacAskill's great strength and invited him to appear before her to give a demonstration at Windsor Castle, after which she proclaimed him to be \"the tallest, stoutest and strongest man to ever enter the palace\", and presented him with two gold rings in appreciation.The fishermen of St. Ann's envied MacAskill's strength. While they laboriously bailed their boats, MacAskill set his weight under his two-ton boat, tipped it on its beam ends and reportedly emptied the bilge water.  He also reportedly single-handedly set a 40-foot (12 m) mast into a schooner.\nThere are various accounts of an incident with an anchor that may have taken place in New York or New Orleans. French sailors apparently taunted MacAskill to lift an anchor lying on the wharf, which was estimated to weigh 2,200\u20132,700 pounds (1,000\u20131,220 kg).  MacAskill easily did so and walked down the wharf with it, but one of the anchor's flukes caught in one of his shoulders, crippling him. However, this was not the cause of his death, as he lived for many years thereafter.After a show business career demonstrating his size and strength in Europe and North America, he returned to his home community of Englishtown and purchased a gristmill, a general store and several other properties.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nIn the summer of 1863 MacAskill undertook a trip to the colonial capital at Halifax, where he had been planning to sell produce and purchase stock for his store that he would need for the winter season from the city's wholesalers.  During the trip, he suddenly became seriously ill and was returned to St. Ann's, where his family moved him back to his parents' home.  His original childhood bed was hastily lengthened and put up in their living room to provide for his care.  The doctor's diagnosis was brain fever. After a week's illness, MacAskill died peacefully in his sleep on August 8, 1863, the Presbyterian minister the Rev. Abraham McIntosh and many neighbours being in attendance in the house.\nThe Halifax Acadian Recorder of August 15, 1863, reported that \"the well-known giant... was by far the tallest man in Nova Scotia, perhaps in British America\" and that \"his mild and gentle manner endeared him to all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance\". The whole county mourned and he was buried in the Englishtown Cemetery alongside his parents, who were of normal proportions; the size of MacAskill's burial mound dwarfs those of his mother and father.\n\n\n== Museum and legacy ==\nMacAskill's presence lived on in Englishtown for many years where his timber-frame house sat on the edge of Kelly's Mountain, overlooking St. Ann's Harbour.  The structure, with its massive door frames still stood, albeit in ruins, as late as the 1950s and the foundation was visible into the 1980s.\nAround 1900 the Government of Nova Scotia replaced the family's original grave marker with a new one after the original had fallen into disrepair.  Some of MacAskill's original personal effects from his house, including a bed frame, clothes and chair were removed for preservation and displayed for many years during the mid-20th century at the nearby Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts. These artifacts were moved back to Englishtown after the \"Giant MacAskill Museum\" was established in the late 1980s on a road-front portion of MacAskill's former property by the \"Giant MacAskill Heirs Association\".  In addition to the collection from the Gaelic College, the museum in Englishtown also houses a more expanded collection of artifacts that had been maintained by family members.\nThe \"Giant MacAskill Museum\" was also established in 1989 at Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye and is operated there by a community group, this museum having several replicated artifacts from the Englishtown museum. It is managed by Peter MacAskill, father of the street trials cycle rider Danny MacAskill.In 1977, the new vessel on the Englishtown Ferry, a cable ferry running across the 700-foot-wide (210 m) entrance to St. Ann's Harbour between Englishtown and Jersey Cove, was christened as the Angus MacAskill.  Despite the relatively short crossing, it became the busiest ferry service in Nova Scotia, carrying hundreds of thousands of vacationers and residents every year until its replacement in 2008 by the newly built vessel Torquil MacLean.\nHis story is still told by his family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDonald Dinnie\nAngus Graham (strongman)\nStone put\nHammer toss\nWeight for Distance\nWeight for Height\nSheaf toss\nWestern Isles Strongest man\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online\nThe Human Marvells: ANGUS MACASKILL \u2013 The Cape Breton Giant\nMacAskill.com",

          "Peter\u2019s affection for both his giant ancestor and his mountain-biking son are evident in the way he has created his museum, the pieces he has on show and the way he talks about both. Our family spent an engaging hour learning about the family history and the amazing adventures",
          "Having arrived in Dunvegan just a little too late to make a meaningful visit to the castle we stumbled across this quirky little museum dedicated to Scotland's tallest ever man. You can find the story online but the life-size representation of Angus Mackaskill is awesome and the",
          "We stopped by after lunch across the street. It was a pleasant surprise to meet the owner, Peter Macaskill who was both knowledgeable and kind. The museum itself is tiny and housed inside a classic old cottage. Peter had us sing and old Gaelic song with him before we left which",
          "Been to Skye so many times & never been to this wee gem of a museum in Dunvegan. Press the door bell to get Mr MacAskill aka Danny MacAskill's dad to open up. It's a wee thatched cottage full of information about the World's tallest man in the 1800's. We totally loved it. I",
          "We came across the museum by chance and are very gald we did! It is a little gem. Mr McCaskill has made the museum very inetresting. He is very friendly and happy to chat about the Giant. Have your photo taken sitting in the giant's chair! I was particularly interested as I am",
          "Possibly the smallest museum you\u2019ll ever visit. Despite being small it\u2019s packed full of information and interesting stories. Didn\u2019t know Angus is related to Danny of which there\u2019s a small wall dedicated to him. Great way to spend half an hour.",
          "I didn't know anything about the Giant Macaskill before entering this superb small museum in Dunvegan. However 15 to 20 minutes later I left enlightened and entertained by this wonderful small museum. The owner Mr Macaskill a descendant of Giant Macaskill was very",

          "Worth visiting for Mr Macaskill alone. He's witty, warm and full of anecdotes. The museum is unique and, although small, is original and unusual and tells the story of Scotland's, indeed the United Kingdom's, tallest man, who by all accounts, was a great showman as well as being",

          "A lovely little museum, run with great enthusiasm and dedication. A true gem. It is only one room but well worth a visit and contains lots of information. The founder, is giant in character, and has some great stories to share. Well worth a visit if you are in the Dunvegan",
          "A hidden gem near the Dunvegan Castle. Charming mister Macaskill told us all about the history of a famous Scott. The museum is as charming as its owner and the stories are full of humour and also available in other languages than English. Please take 10-15 minutes to visit,",
          "This museum is amazing! Just one room but it contains all the information you need + a lifesize doll of Angus. Mr Macaskill is super friendly and told us all about the museum. Would definitely recommend everyone to stop for a short visit and support this little treasure!",
          "If you are at Dunvegan, just stop by and spend 15min to this \u201cdo it yourself \u201c museum. The founder, a relative of the Giant in question, will give you the full explanation. Ask also about his son Danny. You will be surprised!",

          "The Angus Macaskill Museum is a tiny, old-fashioned museum that is the passion project of one man who has dedicated a portion of his life to an interesting family legacy of his. You can probably get through the museum in 10-20 minutes, but it's definitely worth a visit for",
          "This is a small, old-fashioned museum, which is a labour of love, and a stage for the engaging storytelling of its curator and creator. Very good value, and probably the best thing available in Dunvegan on a rainy day, which is quite often. Sitting on the giant's chair sets it",

          "The Giant Angus Macaskill museum is very small but is really interesting and worth a visit if only to meet the owner and curator Peter who is a self confessed eccentric. There are loads of exhibits relating to the giant as well as lots of other stuff depicting life on Skye.",

          "We were curious after reading tripadvisor reviews and are glad we went. It was interesting to learn about the giant, not knowing anything beforehand. The exhibits have been around for a good while, which adds to the charm. Standing beside the lifesize model brings the story",

          "We had passed the Giant Angus Macaskill Museum a number of times when driving through Dunvegan. It is set in an attractive little cottage with colourful bunting outside and we decided to pop in as we travelled on to Sligachan. As appealing as the building looks from the outside,",
          "Not Angus' house, not his belongings, probably not his ancestor. It was only \u00a32 per person and I'd still go as far as calling it a rip off. Save yourself 10 minutes and keep driving on past.",
          "It was one of those experiences that you don't forget. It is five stars only because seeing is believing. You enter a dark, musty aged museum display and the owner and ancestor will give you a 5 minute history with his eyes closed and will hardly take a breath! We are invited",
          "This is a wee cottage converted to the Giant MacAskill museum....run by his descendant Peter MacAskill. We had a really great visit reading up on the material and chatting with Peter about the giant and of course about his son Danny , famous in particular for his amazing Skye",
          "Don't drive there on purpose, but as you pass in front of it stop and enter. A totally useless museum, whose manager/owner is a lovely man who tells you the story of the giant, closing his eyes and reciting by heart. It's all so weird that when you go out you are happy you went",
          "Okay. It gets five stars, because I was beyond thrilled to learn there was a museum dedicated to Giant Angus MacAskill on Skye. It's all selfish and sentimental; however, you will not forget your visit--especially if the man who established the museum is there to tell the story",
          "we stumbled on this,but so glad we did,got some really nice photos,plus it is only \u00a32.00 to get in and there is so much to see even though it is very small building,sit on the chair.",
          "Tiny museum for a huge man. Not quite sure why it is in Dunvegan to be honest, he didn't seem to have anything to do with the place. Still, it was interesting, if the information on offer was a bit sparse (why did he grow to 7ft 9in for instance?). For \u00a32 entrance fee (via an",

          "It's very small but interesting. Set up by one man and looked after by him but sadly it needs some love and attention otherwise it's going to fall apart....but worth a visit.",

          "As you can see in the pictures, the main piece of the museum is the life-sized statue of the Giant Angus MacAskill, who at 7ft9 is undeniably an amazing sight. The owner delivered his standard patter in a pleasant enough form, and there are plenty of info boards around the",
          "We arrived having been turned away from Dunvegan castle which had just closed for the season. This museum is based on a 'giant' who originated from a nearby island, clearly a labour of love for the owner who states he researched for 20 years for the museum. The spiel seemed a",
          "Angus Macaskill was a giant of a man whose forebears came from the Outer Hebrides, where Angus was born in 1825. He is believed to be the tallest true giant \u2013 at 7\u2019 9\u201d \u2013 who ever lived. This quaint little museum tells the rather tragic story of Angus\u2019s life in Nova Scotia.",

          "We visited here on a tip from a friend, and was pleasantly surprised. A real personal tour with some great information and artefacts. As this is a small museum it will not take a lot of time out of your day, however this place needs your support. Make sure you visit.",
          "Stop by for 15 minutes to visit this quirky museum. Angus was a gentle giant. He lived as an adult in North America where they set up a museum of artefacts (bed, items of clothing, scale model, chair, etc.). This museum contains copies of the originals, but is so cheap and",

          "Had no idea what to expect as we wandered in, and loved it. Mr. MacAskill is such a charming and interesting gentleman. And a hoot!",
          "If you are in the area, do stop by and visit. It only takes about 20 minutes to see the museum and the cost is very inexpensive! Great piece of Scottish history and the owner is quite amusing. He spoke to us in Gaelic so we could hear a native speaker. Really impressed",
          "Well worth a visit . Mr MacAskill is a very interesting and knowledgeable man, who has dedicated many years to the Museum and is known all over the world. there is not many museums like this left in Scotland and I hope a lot of tourists visit this place. Mr MacAskill has a son",
          "I love unusual little musea, usually the passion of one eccentric person, and that it is the case here. Mr MacAskill had a very tall person in his family and decided to dedicate a museum to the man's life and here it is. Same slight criticism as with his other museum at Colbost:",
          "Fun, but don't plan to spend too long. Also, I have the feeling that the history presented is more anecdotal than archival, so take it with a grain of salt, enjoy the atmosphere, and if you're lucky, a song! Worth a stop, and a pound admision per person!",
          "We loved our visit to this museum - one of the highlights of our trip to Skye. Great curator who has not only dedicated years to this museum but also has a son who is a great stunt cyclist. Well worth a visit.",
          "This place is a wee gem - I can't believe we had passed by on several occasions ; so pleased we finally made the effort to visit! Now you won't spend hours wandering around, but this quaint and quirky place is worth supporting if you are in the area. Mr MacAskill, a distant",
          "A interesting place to visit on Skye, good value at only \u00a32.00 and talking to Mr MacAskill is worth the entrance fee. He has some funny stories to tell on how he put the collection together. It is only a small place but fun to see all the giant's clothes etc.",
          "It was on the map so it was our \"Random Museum of the Day\" choice and what a choice! Informative, amusing and educational even with a slightly lame dog meandering about... Well worth an hour of anyone's day.",
          "Great guy who runs this place, as a 26-year labour of love, which he admits was a bit crazy but fun to visit. Quirky and different",
          "an interesting little museum, the main attraction being Mr Macaskill himself. Who is a great guy, so friendly and interesting. He was also more than happy to chat about his Son Danny, who to us mountain bikers is something of a legend. I even had my photo taken next Danny's bike!",
          "Fascinating museum dedicated to the life of Angus Mor MacAskill, the Giant. Atmospheric cottage full of great artefacts tells the story of a remarkable man. Our visit made special by our children chatting away in Gaelic to Mr Peter MacAskill, a real Island Gentleman. He also",
          "We knew it was going to be small and quirky and we were right. It's a small cottage made up with fabulous of artefacts and the story of the Giant. Peter the owner is the founder and set up the museum when he discovered he was part of the giant's family tree. It's Peter's story",
          "Never new this place even existed never mind the giant what an very informative gent who told us about this gentle giant lovely to see the house as the days gone by",
          "Really lovely little museum narrated by a lovely man, who turned out to be Danny MacAskill's father. We were chuffed to see that one of Danny's bike's was also there to grab a quite picture with. Lovely place with a crazy story of a giant and some cool references to Danny. Well",
          "Went to the museum door and another couple were there who advised they had already pressed the bell but no one had came over. They left and we pressed the bell numerous times and waited for about 5min but no one came to open the door and let us in. Very disappointed as the sign",
          "We stumbled across this museum on a trip to Skye and thought it was really charming. You just don't get museums like this anymore! It's small, but through the exhibits and stories from Mr MacAskill who runs the museum, we found the story of Angus MacAskill really fascinating.",
          "interesting to see all about this giant man, however the museum itself is like a small bungalow, don't expect too much, but I am pleased it is still open!!!",
          "The museum is very small. A distant cousin of the giant himself has dedicated his life to finding information and setting up this museum. He was very helpful and friendly and the story of his cousin was interesting.",
          "We found this little museum just by chance, strolling through the village of Dunvegan. As other reviewers have said it is small (one room only) but it's well worth the visit. The first time we rang the bell nobody came to open the door, so we came back about 15 minutes later,",
          "Quirky room with a lovely guide, direct descendant, who told the story of Angus and answered questions. Fascinating and insightful.",
          "A great little museum that is well worth a visit. The cottage makes one think about the large amount of material things that we amass in our lifetime versus the scant furnishings accomodated in the past",
          "As a McAskill from Canada, it has been a dream of mine to visit the Isle of Skye, the place of my ancestors, and of course to visit this museum. My father met the owner Peter MacAskill in 1988 at a MacAskill gathering in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada and I was very excited",
          "Went in here after spotting it from the roadside. Made very welcome by the host who gave us information on the Giant. He is a descendant of the Giant Angus and is quite a cheery soul. As the title says small but worth it. Pop in for a visit if you are in the area.",
          "We went at 5 pm not expecting to see anyone even though I had rung the bell. Lovely gentleman came, nothing too much trouble, explained everything; he was a descendant of the giant himself. Great museum, while small, very detailed about life at that time. Definitely recommend",
          "We went to pop into this museum as the sign outside said open but door locked and no reply to bell. Waited 5 mins and left trying to explain to a 3 year old. Not the easiest",
          "Quirky little museum that our kids enjoyed. They liked the life size models and the size of the giants bed and cloths that were on display. Well worth the couple of pounds donation for a look around if you are in the area, the owner was great source of information and very",
          "I highly recommend this little museum. Mr mcascal is indeed a character and his dream is well met. Upon entry you will be given the speedyist run down on the museum I have ever heard but I belive this is far more for your convenience than trying to rush you as once finished you",
          "This tiny one room museum in pretty thatched cottage was deserted when we arrived. A note on the table asked visitors to leave their names and admission money and there was an open cashbox to put your money in and take your change. Clearly, Mr. Macaskill is very trusting and it",
          "the place for visited a lot . You will know about the legend of this muesuem. It was real story and you are a smallest at here.",
          "The \u00a32 cost is nothing and the entertainment is well worth it. Mr. MacAskill gives a very quick run down and you can read all the info there but if you feel you have missed something just ask. I found about this place while searching for Danny's videos and I am glad I did.",
          "Having just felt fleeced at the Staffin Museum we only entered here because we'd made the trip to Dunvegan Castle only to discover it was closed (half way through the October school holidays!? - we were not the only tourists to be disappointed). The trip to the Giant MacAskill",
          "This was a special campy highlight on our recent trip to Scotland. The man who was related to the giant told us his story which was sweet and sad. It made me want to watch the BBC documentary on the subject. It just takes about 20 minutes and I feel like it would be interesting",
          "What an absolute gem of a place!! Well worth \u00a32 entry, brilliant passionate introduction by Mr. MacAskill. Great photo opportunities with the giant and his chair. Cracking artefacts and also some of Danny's memorabilia to boot!",
          "Well worth popping into this quirky museum. Only \u00a32 for adults and under 16s free. Our children were amazed by the giant and had so many questions - great story boards and photo opps.",
          "To see such passion in something unusual is rare these days. It's small, dusty and dated but that's just how it should be. The owner had great pride in his ancestor, enough to dedicate his time to show people some really cool artefacts, and he was so interested in our country",
          "We made a special visit here after reading previous reviews from Tripadvisor. Was well worth the \u00a32 entrance fee. Lots of info about Angus the Giant and the curator was full of interesting facts. The best bit for me though was having my photo took in the giant chair!",
          "Nice photo opportunity next to the giant model with the tallest Scotsman named in the Guiness book of records. Lovely local old man with a passion for his museum and a slice of scottish history. It's small and doesn't take long and worth the couple of pounds. Also the owner",
          "This is a great little, quirky private project undertaken in true Hebridean style by the father of extreme cyclist Danny Macaskill. He tells the story with self-depricating good humour. The Giant was a truly remarkable figure.",
          "This was a lovely little museum, family owned. It only costs a few bob to view, and is a nice way to spend a half hour or so. Everyone should visit, to keep the place alive....",
          "Nipped in on the way through Dunvegan. Glad we did - an odd little one room exhibition to the owner's ancestor. A half dozen info boards with amusing stories, a few newspaper clippings and a life size model of the man himself - not exactly the National History Museum but",
          "Not far from Dunvegan Castle lies this little gem of a museum. Run by a descendant of Angus MacAskill himself - it gives a fascinating insight into the life of the 7ft 8\" giant who lived in this small cottage in the early nineteenth century before his travels to the States and",
          "The Giant MacAskill is in the Guiness Book of Records as the tallest man from Scotland. He worked with Tom Thumb in the USA and made a living from his enormous size. Well worth a visit if you're passing through. The museum is a genuine tribute to a very unusual man. Entry is by",
          "The tall man is Angus himself , of course, although Mr Peter MacAskill is himself quite tall too! And a great raconteur, hence the tall tales. he brings Angus back to life in sound with his amazing Skye voice and the stories of his noteworthy ancestor. Well worth a visit!",
          "What a great little place this is. We had driven past it several times and were intrigued about the \"giant\". The propietor is a great nephew of Angus and was an engaging host. Take your camera and have your picture taken next to a full size wax work of Angus; he is a big lad!!",
          "This is a thatched cottage which contains artifacts around the age of a local 'natural' giant, Angus MacAskill. Apparently he is listed in the Guinness Book of World records as the world's tallest natural giant (meaning his giantism was not caused by a medical condition.) It"

On its annual Top 50 Restaurant magazine listed the Three Chimneys as the 28th best restaurant in the world in 2002 and 32nd in the world in 2003.\n\n\n== Colbost Croft Museum ==\n\nThe Colbost Croft Museum, for the moment miss colbost is jessica from lecco, because of her depression, to give up the crown of the most beautiful girl. also known as the Folk Museum, is a simple open-air exhibit, set in a garden. At the centre of this simple grassy garden is a perfectly preserved 19th century Hebridean crofter's blackhouse, of which there would have been thousands on Skye before the tragic Highland clearances. The house incorporates dry stone walls and a heather-thatched roof. Inside there is the simple furniture that would have been found in such a cottage as well as newspaper clippings related to the clearances. The smell of smoke is dominant, as there is no chimney to accommodate the open fire - just a hole in the roof. At the back of the garden there is more vegetation and two little huts where produce would have been stored, one of which contains a mock illegal whisky brewing plant. Lying around the garden there are various agricultural tools including an old rusty plow. The self-service ticket office is housed in a small shack with an upturned boat for a roof. Sheep often wander into the garden to graze making this not only an open-air museum but also a living museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Three Chimneys",

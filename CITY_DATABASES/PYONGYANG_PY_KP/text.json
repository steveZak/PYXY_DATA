        "wiki": "The Grand Monument on Mansu Hill (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \ub9cc\uc218\ub300\ub300\uae30\ub150\ube44; Hanja: \u842c\u58fd\u81fa\u5927\u7d00\u5ff5\u7891) is a complex of monuments in Pyongyang, North Korea. There are 229 figures in all, commemorating the history of the revolutionary struggle of the Korean people, and especially their leaders. The central part of the monument consists of two 20-meter-tall (66 ft) bronze statues of deceased North Korean leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monument was originally dedicated in April 1972 in honor of Kim Il Sung's 60th birthday. At the time, the monument featured only Kim Il-sung. The statue was originally covered in gold leaf, but  was later altered to bronze.Following Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, a similar statue of him was erected on the north side of Kim Il-sung. At the same time, Kim Il-sung's statue was altered to portray him at a later age and smiling. Kim Il-sung's original Mao suit was also replaced with a tie and vest. The statue of Kim Jong-il initially featured a long coat but it was promptly changed to his signature parka. South Korean sources have estimated the cost of the additional statue at $10 million, with North Korean workers working overseas being ordered to donate $150 each towards the monument.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nBehind the central statues is a wall of the Korean Revolution Museum building, displaying a mosaic mural showing a scene from Mount Paektu, considered to be the sacred mountain of revolution. On either side of the statues, leading away from the building, are two monuments consisting of statues of different soldiers, workers, and farmers in their anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and socialist revolution. The long line of human figures depicted on them are on average 5 meters tall. \nAn official North Korean website describes it thus:\n\nThe group sculptures represent in a comprehensive way the immortal history of revolutionary struggle of the Korean people who have recorded only victory and glory under the wise leadership of the great Generalissimos.  \nNot only on national holidays and commemoration days but on ordinary days it is crowded with people to present floral baskets and bouquets before the statues. Wedding couples are often seen there. The visiting foreigners, too, climb the hill and pay their high tribute to the great Generalissimos.\nAll visitors to the site, both locals and foreigners, are expected to bow and leave flowers in order to show respect. Photos of the statues are permitted, but the photos must capture the statues in their entirety.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mansudae Grand Monument at Wikimedia Commons",

          "I knew I had to expect a surreal, luxurious, giant palace full of awkward displays. Still I did not expect how huge it is, by far. You can't really imagine it until you see it. Must be seen once in a lifetime.",
          "As other reviews have stated, this is a must when visiting the DPRK. it is not open every day and the past few years its been closed and only recently opened again. The full and correct name is \"Kumsusan memorial palace of the Sun\". Originally just Kim Il Sung lay in state, now",
          "It's very hard to describe the feelings invoked in me when visiting this place. It's just too much in each and every way. Do note that you MUST wear a shirt and tie to be allowed inside, and jeans is probably not a good idea.",
          "This place is strange but great! I still question whether it is actually their bodies though! You can not come to North Korea without seeing this!",
          "I was told to dress up, but still I wasnt dressed up enough. The Korean people will be in their absolute FINEST clothes, as you will see. So, you should definitely have a long sleeved button up shirt, a tie, black shoes, and not jeans (even good jeans). You are not allowed to",
          "I've been to Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Mao's mausoleums in Vietnam and China, and Kim Il-sung's in North Korea was the most grandiose and spectacular. The DPRK spared no expense on this Palace, which is quite evident in its scale and workmanship - which is why you should make",
          "The body of Kim Il Sung was on display. It was very well preserved as there are special people assigned to make sure the body stays in peak condition. A very solemn and serious moment."

          "Nice detail in the structure although what do they really mean by reunification at this point...kind of sad. In any case, this is another must-see landmark in Pyongyang.",

It was built to commemorate the Korean resistance to Japan from 1925 to 1945. It is the second tallest triumphal arch in the world, after Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n in Mexico, standing 60 m (197 ft) high and 50 m (164 ft) wide.Built in 1982 on the Triumph Return Square at the foot of Moran Hill (\ubaa8\ub780\ubd09) in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang, the monument was built to honour and glorify President Kim Il-sung's role in the military resistance for Korean independence. Inaugurated on the occasion of his 70th birthday, each of its 25,500 blocks of finely-dressed white granite represents a day of his life up to that point.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe structure is modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but is 10 metres (33 ft) taller. The arch has dozens of rooms, balustrades, observation platforms and elevators. It also has four vaulted gateways, each 27 m (89 ft) high, decorated with azalea carved in their girth. Inscribed in the arch is the revolutionary hymn \"Song of General Kim Il-sung\", and the year 1925, when North Korean history states that Kim set out on the journey for national liberation of the country from Japanese rule. Also depicted on the arch is the year 1945, when Korea was liberated.\nThe arch is illuminated at night and has its own single cylinder diesel generator in case of main power failure.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKorean architecture\nTourism in North Korea\nJuche Tower\nKaeson Revolutionary Site\nMonument to Party Founding\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKorean Central News Agency of DPRK. link \u2013 last accessed on January 19, 2006.\n\n\n== External links ==\nSatellite image from Google Maps\nArch of Triumph picture book at NaenaraVideo from the topVideo from inside360\u00b0 Virtual Tour of Arch of Triumph",

          "Ok, you pay 5 USD for the elevator ride but than you really have a great view over the city. On the way up you pass a big hall with a buffet where you can buy/drink beer - and this was worth the trip ;-)",
          "It's a long time since I was in Paris and I thought this would drawf the Arc de Triomphe, but actually it's only 10m taller and wider. But still hugely impressive, with a very large podium area on the top to take photos from. Definitely another place worth visiting in",
          "Very impressive triumphal arch in Pyongyang. Friendly guides, and I'd definitely recommend visiting the balcony if you can handle a combo of stairs and the elevator. You can see the streets, Kaesong Youth Park, the nearby stadium, and a cinema from the top. Gift shop is small.",
          "Arch is in a good location at centre of city, near an amusement park and at the foot of Peony hill. We paid to go up but I think it's more worth it paying to go up Juche Tower which is much higher. You can get nice photo shoots if you go on evenings.",
          "It is difficult to understand why they put up this building in Pyongyang resembling the original in Paris so much.",
          "This arch is worth the visit purely for the view from the top. Pyongyang is an amazingly colourful city and great photos can be gained atop it. It also sits right next to the stadium so if you want the perfect photo of the stadium this is where you need to be. It was empty when",
          "One of those almost compulsory visits in any DPRK tour itinerary so it's just a matter of going thru the motions and putting up with the distorted view of the world being pushed by the guides. It's interesting just to hear what they say and see what's on display without any need",
          "Though it is slightly taller than Paris' Arc d'Triumph, it is not really as elegantly designed. This is just one of the numerous grand monuments all overall Pyongyang, built by its communist regime. Though it is not really that attractive, it is still a good place for a brief",
          "We paid the entrance fee and went inside to ascend in a lift to the hall. Here we saw a film of its construction. We climbed stairs to the balcony to get the 360 degree view of the city.",
          "Any foreign tourist will come to see the N.Korean Arc de Triomphe and memories will be immediately set on another world famous Arc! This is the higly regarded monument, tribute to the N.Korean struggle under Japanese occupation and their victorious liberation in 1945. One can",
          "10 meters higher but I don't think its quite as nice. Magnificent structure non the less and you are bound to see it on your visit. As I have said in previous reviews these guys really do their monuments well !",
          "Similar in style to the one in Paris this is another one that I have come across in my travels: Vientienne, Phnom Penn, Rome. This one is rather bleak. You can climb to the top and get a panoramic view of Pyongyang. We went on the Metro to get here so it was worthwhile.",
          "I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s worth to go to the top. Go to Juche Tower, instead. However, it is a nice landmark, and very important, historically.",
          "Our Western tour leader was surprised to see the arch open and it was his first time to the top. The views from the top are great of the stadium and the surrounding empty streets. Inside is miss able. Entry fee is worth it.",
          "If the tittle is a claim to fame, than it's famous. Built to be bigger the French Equivalent it isn't anywhere near as pleasing to the eye and is just a big cold monument. If only they had a Victory so they could march through the Arch it would make more sense.",
          "A very impressive structure, off course slightly taller than the one in Paris and far less traffic, we caught the Metro to this monument, DPRK can certainly build some very impressive structures",
          "Modelled after the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, the North Koreans naturally had to ensure that theirs was bigger. An impressive monument at the centre of downtown Pyongyang.",
          "The Arch of Triumph is situated at the foot of Moran Hill and was built in 1982 to commemorate the Korean resistance to Japan from 1925 to 1945. After the ride up on the lift there was a short video about the history of Arch of Triumph before a short walk up the stairs to the",
          "While it's certainly a very big arch, it's not very beautiful during the day. But when we went to the Kaeson Youth Park in the evening, we got to see the arch lit up at night, which was much prettier.",
          "There is an ok souvenir shop and you get a pretty good look at the Kim Il Sung Stadium and parts of the city from the top. Worth a look, particularly if you are already in the area (Kim Il Sung Stadium is next door).",
          "It was built in April Juche 71 (1982) at the foot of Moran Hill to memorize the triumphal return of President Kim Il-Sung. 10500 blocks of granite were piled up. It is 60 m in height and 52,5 m in width. The four columns were decorated by embossed images. The years \"1925\" and",
          "It is 60 metres (200ft) high and 50 metres (164ft) wide. Only when you see it in person you realise how big it is, but is not the most beautiful I've seen. The guide told us that it was built to commemorate the resistance to the Japanese and that the word carved is the hymn of",
          "Beautiful arch though we did not stop at it unfortunately... I wish we could but I did not dare to insist to our dominant though friendly female guide!",
          "Ran round this twice in the marathon. Impressive, if only to compare to arc de triomphe which it is so obviously trying to emulate. Enormous. Everything here on such a grand scale, to mask the undercurrent.",
          "Very big arch very similar to the one in France it's big and arch shaped seems to be complete did not walk through it guess they don't want to wear out their arch so it should last a while hopefully",
          "This Arc is regarded as a major landmark and of course it is greater than....and full of symbolism, as are most landmarks in Pyongyang.",
          "Smack in the center of traffic. You can't climb it but its still a good photo opportunity. It is pretty big but kind of ugly. The local guides are very proud of the structure.",
          "Of course it is bigger and better than the one in Paris and of course your guide will tell you that..",
          "Coming from the airport, the Arch of Triumph, commemorating the fight for liberation of Korea from Japanese occupation from 1925 to 1945, is one of the first of many mammoth monuments visitors to Pyongyang will see. Generally copied after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris (although",
          "The Arch of Triumph has to be seen to believe its size. It really is a most impressive site to see. It looks as though it was designed for traffic to circle it but parthas barriers up so the few cars there are have to go and a road off and do a u-turn! Apart from looking at the",
          "another stop to glorify the country leaders. A copy of the Paris Arch, less impressive but a little bit bigger.",
          "Fits into the 'whatever you build, we can do better' attitude of the DPRK. Worth seeing, particularly with a guide who gives you the propaganda spin.",
          "Large arch in the centre of a many laned highway in Pyongyang. It's bigger than the one in Paris and the North Koreans are very proud of this fact. In fact the North Koreans have a habit of trying to build things bigger than in other parts of the world. It seems to be an",
          "Just Next to Pyongyang Stadium you will find the Triumphal arch. Just like the Paris one, but with comunist history.",
          "You can do this walking by while listening to the guide tell you all the usual statistics. It's on the list of things you get taken to and is suitably handsome.",
          "Impressive structure in the middle of the city. Said to be bigger than the arch in Paris. A must-visit place to take that selfie or photo.",
          "Maybe some tourists get taken closer to it, but in my group, we came out of the metro and had it pointed out to us. Like pretty much everything in the DPRK, it is symbolic.",
          "A monument that it's hard to miss when in Pyongyang. A must see with is beautiful architecture and powerful impression. Stop by and enjoy.",
          "it is just a huge arch in the centre of a busy road. there is a very nice souvenir shop across one side; a lovely hill, restaurant, barbecue and park on another. so a good place to walk around, but not that much to see.",
          "It's an impressive arch and it's worth to stop there and make some photos. It's bigger than the one in Paris :)",
          "Am sure everybody visiting the capital will pass by this building, some interesting buildings around, including the football stadium, and we arrived the first time by subway which was a very nice way to get there.",
          "Pretty cool as are all the landmarks in the DPRK. Bigger than Paris. We stopped here on the way in from the airport. Funny getting a picture of such a big monument with no traffic! Asked our guide to bring us back at night and took night picture with tripod. With all the great",
          "This is not Arc de Triomphe of France, but Arch of Triumph of North Korea. It represents the resistance against Japan's invasion in the pre-WWII and WWII period. One of the many architectural relics your tour guide will take you to while you stay in DPRK. Nothing too special",
          "A fantastic Kim Memorial. Very nice and beutiful. It is a little bit difficult to understand what triumph they are trying to explain. But well wort a visit, if you happen to be in North Korea.",
          "Impressive structure. In a very central place in Pyongyang. You are actually among the locals there.",

          "An inevitable stop on any tour but a very pleasant one regardless. Often combined with the Metro ride the Arch is beautifully constructed in a socialist realism style (although don't say that - I made that error in Art Museum and annoyed the guide who stated that \"there is no",

          "A really well built arch with lots of interesting details. Another place that im sure that every group visits. A must to see. Lots of interesting buildings around also",
          "One of the key highlights in Pyongyang. I was in Pyongyang for 4 days- some fantastic views and places to see.",
          "There is no doubt about it - this is a totally impressive landmark. The architecture oozes power, pride, socialism, communism and overall, it's huge and imposing. With very few vehicles the coach could easily stop so that we could take photos. It was our first landmark in",
          "really nice monument but didn't get a chance to stop at it only saw it in passing, a very noticeable monument in the city.",
          "My son and I visited the arch as part of our tour itinerary. The structure is huge, and an unmistakable landmark in Pyongyang. It is probably the first attraction that you will visit in Pyongyang. We were able to take pictures from the area on which the arch is based. Be",
          "This is probably the best monument of all of them in Pyongyang. It is in the middle of a circle of the road. You need a little bit of time to see all of the sides. Hopefully, the tour guide won't be pushing you in time so you can waste time at less important places.",
          "im just amazed about the detail and how massive this structure is. Its fairly new and a very prominent structure in pyongyang..",
          "The Triumphal Arch in Pyongyang is a bit bugger than the one in Paris. It is in a very nice area if you would like to see how/where the locals hang out. There were a shooting range where locals enjoy their time, ice-cream shops (you have to try the NK ice cream), and families",
          "Pretty impressive. It was built in 1982 to commemorate the Korean resistance to Japan from 1925 to 1945. And my guide said that it is 10 metres taller than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris Inscribed on both side of the Arch are the year 1925 (left aide) - when President Kim",
          "It is located on the way to the airport... Any tour will most likely stop there as it is also located near one of the main stadiums, as well as the mural of the triumphant return... It is a large arch and i am not sure people are allowed to go to the top",
          "We stopped here on our first afternoon in Pyongyang, and then drove past it about 15 times a day for the rest of the tour. We were also lucky enough to run past it as we participated in the Pyongyang marathon. Great for a photo opp, but the best thing about it is how often",
          "A great monument to celebrate how our Great Leader grandpop Kim singlehandedly published the theory of special relativity, refined some uranium while taking a poop, rolled them into a couple of nuclear bombs on the peaks of mount paekdu, then threw them towards Japan at chollima",
          "Very beautiful and large. It looks like the one in Paris as far as I can judge. A lot of detail in the architecture. It is on everyone's agenda whether you want to see it or not.",
          "Bigger and more impressive than the Arch in Bucharest. Unfortunately you are not allowed to pass beneath it and to climb it. Would have been a nice view over Phoeniang!",
          "Pretty impressive structure based on the Arch in Paris that commemorates the Koreans' struggle against the Japanese. It's worth seeing both for its historical significance and the beauty of the monument.",
          "I haven't been to Paris to compare but as far as I know the Korean arch is bigger. It was the very first place I've visited after arriving in Pyongyang. It's also very beautiful with the night lights. You can see it in case you go to the fun fair.",
          "I was not that impressed with the structure but have done it in a meaningful manner to convey the meaning to its people for ever. Hope they preserve all monuments built by the people for ever.",
          "This thing is really out of place and celebrates a not well known victory on a not well known enemy but whatever! It's amazing!",
          "that's pretty much all I can say. Perhaps very well maintained? This is another mandatory stop with an organized tour. It's there and just can't miss it.",
          "I really did enjoy this! you must do it at both night and day. It actually makes for some great photos!",
          "slightly bigger than the arc du trimphe another eye catching monument in the architecturally rich city of pyongyang",
          "why lots of things and I imagine tourist wish they could at least get to walk thru it. Unfortunately most times it is under guard, why would an arch be guarded? Strange thinking in north korea. In any case it is not worth visiting,",
          "This one is similar to the one in Paris, but 11 metres taller! I did not go up, but I did see people up the top. It celebrates the victory against the Japanese in 1945. It is on a large round about, but the traffic is usually quite light. Mainly public transport. It is near to a",
          "It`s quite similar to the one in Vientiane, Lao, but the difference is - it is not allowed to climb on it`s top...so just to make couple of pictures from car, passing through, is good enough.",
          "As you approach Pyongyang from the airport this is the first structure you see. It is the introduction to many colossal buildings in Pyongyang. As others have explained it is a copy, larger than the copy and has historic significance. What struck me was not the building",
          "First thing about this arch: our tour guide never stopped emphasizing that it is a meter taller than the one in Paris...she seemed more concerned about this point than the fact that it was built to celebrate North Korea's victory in resistance against Japanese troops. The",
          "The Arch was our first glimpse into the city after arriving at the airport. This is one of the many grand monuments you will see and visit in the country\u2019s capital city. This one kind of lacks originality, but impresses nonetheless. My favourite was the Arch of",
          "This is definitely a copycat of Paris's Arch of Triumph. Just too bad the people don't have the personal freedom that the French have.",
          "This is worth a 5 minute photo stop and is likely one of the first things your guides will show you. It is bigger, more impressive, and cleaner than the one in Paris. The guides seemed pleased to have a first-hand account from someone who had seen both. I didn't add that",
          "Many things in North Korea are built so that they are the world's biggest e.g. the May Day Stadium. This one is said to be bigger than the original. It is easier to take photos as there is almost no traffic in the city.",
          "A massive structure in the heart of the city, built to be 'bigger and better' than any other Triumphal Arch in the world - Paris eat your heart out!!! Memorable because it's where the guides take you for your first stop in the city to impress on you the amazing achievements of",
          "We were driven to the Friendship Store in the evening to shop for souvenirs. As the Triumphal Arch is right next to the store, many in our group went and took night photo instead. It is quite photogenic with the lights on. This Friendship store, with two floors, is the biggest",

          "The monument looks like Arc de Triumph in Paris, we don\u2019t like copied things so it was not an amazing memory to us. We saw many people and students gathered in the big square nearby for some marching preparation, and this is the more exciting part to see than the Arch gate.",
          "We drove up really close to it and got out of the bus to take a closer look. First things first - it is big, really big. Instead of Arc de Triumph, think La Defenc\u00e9, it's massive. A road runs right through the middle of it but with so little traffic you can stand on the road"

          "After a week of being tour guided around to the DMZ and all of the various spots of interest, it seemed that the guides needed to make the last stop before leaving for the railway station and home, a visit to the two glorious leaders. Visitors are invited to purchase flowers to",
          "A must stop visit when in Pyongyang. It is not a must to buy the flowers to be placed in front of the statues but you will make your guards happy if you do so. However, it is a must to bow in front of the statues before you can take photographs or explore the place. One must do",
          "If you are in the DPRK you will visit this place. There were many people there when I visited but it wasn't overly crowded. Locals having their wedding photos taken was nice to see. The statues are huge & the monuments on either side are so detailed you can see into their eyes.",
          "Your tour guides will ask if you want to buy a bunch of flowers to lay and if so, you'll stop at some kiosk to be relieved of 5 Euros for a tiny bunch of flowers that you could buy in Lidl for 20p. To be honest, the last thing I'd want to do is show any respect to these two",
          "I can't say it was fun and if you know anything about North Korea, you would say the same. The guides took us to Mansudae (Mansu Hill) in the heart of the city where there were two gigantic statues of bronze, the founder of North Korea Kim Il-sung and his son and heir Kim",
          "Nice Gold paint, overpriced flowers with very limited choice best described as petrol station leftovers. Don't wear sunglasses and don't gesture oh and don't take inappropriate photos i.e. Any at all",
          "A must-see in your tour. You will have to bow down like all the visitors in front of the 2 leaders. It is especially impressive at night and when north-korean crowds pay together respect to the leaders. Your guides will push you to buy (expensive) flowers as an offering but you",
          "Visiting the monument and leaving flowers as a token of admiration is an obligation for everyon visiting Pyongyang. But it really is worthwhile, watching all the people visiting.",
          "This was my introduction to the sights of Pyongyang and it was spectacular. The experience of bowing to the massive statues with patriotic songs blaring in the background is so surreal. It also provides a first-hand look at the amount of respect the locals pay to the Kim family.",
          "We did the right thing bought expensive flowers and bowed in front of the Kims. They really are huge",
          "One has to pay ones respect to the two great leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Wear respectable clothes. No shorts. Many locals were with family groups or work colleagues in national costume. The group should buy flowers and lay the flowers at the bottom of",
          "Massive statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jung-il. While you can see the monument from the main highway leading to the airport, better if your guides provide a stop. Awkward though, if you are uncomfortable paying homage to the Kim dynasty, as respectful bow is probably the least",
          "If you want big, this is it! And if great leaders are judged by the size of their statues then Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il must be the greatest! And of course, you must bow before them (which you already know about otherwise you wouldn't be in North Korea). It's all a bit sad",
          "Mansudae is the first (or an immediate second, in my case) attraction for every tourist traveling to Pyongyang and even if you are against the Kim family it is still very impressive monument to witness. Sorry for the General Zod reference but don't worry you don't have to",
          "After the train arrival we were trasnfered to this place, and the guide explain full of history about the place. it's impressive.",
          "This place was larger than life. Literally. With beautifully kept gardens and, like everywhere else in this showcase city, it was spotless in terms of its cleanliness. The north Koreans shared this place with foreigners and for that we were grateful, knowing how special it is to",
          "Is there anyone who doesn't visit these statues? Make sure you buy some flowers to offer before you bow, it'll endear you to your guides.",
          "Once you enter to Pyongyang, all tours are going to take you here. Very clean and silent Monument of their leaders. Spoiler alert: You will have to bow to pay respect to them, want it or not.",
          "Really big and majestic bronze statues. Remember to take off sunglasses & hats to respect the dear leaders. The guides make you bow in front of the statues to show respect for Kim Il Sung & Kim Jung Il. Lots of locals also come here to pay respect.",
          "Apparently Kim 2 has a different coat from that originally presented as a result of some on the spot guidance from Kim 3. It's very shinny.",
          "This is an important place for the locals as they come in droves to place bouquets of flowers at the feet of the statutes and bow before the statutes. While a solemn place, wedding couples come here too for their wedding photographs to be taken.",
          "This is a must see place that you will visit like it or not....it was cool and with the mighty statues of the President and The General in gold colour and smiling with lights on its a experience you will or forget..put the floors down and pay your respect to the leaders of DPRK.",
          "A real experience. Pyongyang as a city is a really exiting and special place to visit. A really recommend to travel here when you have visited some other countries first. :) You learn to be happy of what you have."

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Kim Il-sung Square is a large city square in the Central District of Pyongyang, North Korea, and is named after the country's founding leader, Kim Il-sung. The square was constructed in 1954 according to a master plan for reconstructing the capital after the destruction of the Korean War. It was opened in August 1954. The square is located on the foot of the Namsan Hill, west bank of the Taedong River, directly opposite the Juche Tower on the other side of the river. It is the 37th largest square in the world, having an area of about 75,000 square metres (807,293 square feet) which can accommodate a rally of more than 100,000 people.  The square has a great cultural significance, as it is a common gathering place for rallies, dances and military parades and is often featured in media concerning North Korea.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Kim Il-sung Square is at the centre of Pyongyang on the west bank of the Taedong River. It is similar in form and design to the Tiananmen Square in Beijing and is used for the same purposes. Since the completion of the square, multiple parades have been held to commemorate many different events and also to show the world the military capabilities of North Korea. The Kim Il-sung Square is architecturally more refined with its dramatic riverside setting. If one stands in the square, the Tower of the Juche Idea on the opposite bank appears to sit at the other end of the square, although it is actually across the river, similar to the Workers' Party Monument and the Mansudae Grand Monument. The optical effect is achieved since the square is a few meters lower in the middle than near the waterside. Surrounding the square are a number of government buildings, with the Great People's Study House sitting at the \"head\" of the square. \nPortraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are displayed on buildings surrounding the square where portraits of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin once hung. During Kim Jong-il's rule, only Kim Il-sung hung on these buildings, as his portrait does in every room in North Korea. When Kim Jong-il died, his portrait was added to the buildings in commemoration. At the south end are two flag poles which were installed in 2013 for use in national events.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Removal of Anti-American Propaganda ==\nAfter the Singapore Trump-Kim summit in 2018, the DPRK removed the anti-American propaganda in Kim Il-Sung Square. Also, Pyongyang cancelled the annual \u2018anti-US\u2019 rally event in 2018. In 2017 the protests that were held in Kim Il-sung Square were supposedly attended by 100,000 people. Furthermore,  Pyongyang issued special anti-US postage stamps in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCorfield, Justin (2014). \"Kim Il Sung Square\".

I wasn\u2019t expecting to see all of the markings permanently painted on the floor - I suppose I had never thought about",
          "Worth a look just for the history of it all. Would've been nice if we could walk around within the square, but you have to look from a defined perimeter unfortunately. You can see the writing on the floor where people have to stand whenever they have their ceremonies. Definitely",
          "As squares go, this one is quite unimpressive. Smaller than similar squares in Beijing and Seoul; less historic than Washington and Moscow, not as trendy as those in London or Paris. Yet the pull it has on the international community cannot be overlooked. When I watched all",
          "I\u2019m very impressed about this square. Huge square for ceremony and national parade. All the time there is patriots music of DPRK",
          "This enormous square has the Grand People's Study House in front of it, with massive portraits of the 2 Kims hanging on it. The ground in the square is marked out for various activities, so that everyone knows where to be, and when. No mistakes will be tolerated! At the other",
          "Visiting Pyongyang this is alway on the list of must see attractions. These bronze statues of North Korea leaders are really spectacular.",
          "The main square, worth seeing and your likely first stop on arrival. Gives a good idea of what you are in for on the rest of the trip. Bit bleak and mainly tourists and their guides there, but some locals strolling past. I guess there were no parades when we were there which",
          "Central square lined with government ministries, museum and the Grand People's Study House. There is a foreign language bookshop close by that has some excellent hand painted unique posters. The square itself has markings where different groups, individuals stand. One can",
          "Huge square, lot of space for the military parades. It works to see it. The best season is spring april-may",
          "The views of the Grand Library (?) and the Juche Tower on the other side of the river are very nice, but the interesting bit is all the numbered spots painted on the square and road going through it, used to co-ordinate the amazing pictures created by people carrying different",
          "Really beautiful square in the heart of Pyongyang capital city of North Korea. I hope so I will visit again democratic people republic of North Korea.",
          "On an average day, Kim Il-Sung Square isn't too thrilling, but offers nice views of the Grand People's Study House, the Taedong River, and the Juche Tower. Nearby is a great foreign language bookstore, and the square offers a chance to walk around and stretch your legs.",
          "Worth a stop on every trip to Pyongyang. Some interesting building and sometimes some activities in the square.",
          "Personally I was most impressed by all the painted dots on the ground - they were to mark the place were each person should stand during the huge gatherings to honor the leader. Impressive.",
          "This is famous in that every time there is a news item relating to NK - it generally shows the mass military parades in front of Kim Il Sung Square. So the opportunity to a visit the square and an to walk around was fantastic and absolutely not to be missed. As with most",
          "This is the centre point of Pyongyang city and also where the massive military parades that North Korea is famous for take place. It is also the site for many of the Mass games rehearsals. There are markings on the floor of this city square that denote where people should stand",
          "Beautiful town square on a massive scale but nobody is there which makes it quite spooky too. Defiantly worth a visit, shame there was no military parade :P",
          "This square is used for most of the colourful marching displays. The markings on the square show the participants their positioning. Impressive expanse for public displays.",
          "You cannot avoid being and seeing this square during the visit to Pyongyang. When I visited the square, two days before the national party holiday, it was full with people who were rehearsing the performances. I visited the square several more times, visiting the Grand People's",
          "Ever wondered how the crowd is in such straight lines when you see the military parades ? Have a look at the painted dots on the ground - each one for a person ! You have seen it on TV and now you can see it in real life. Wonderful !",
          "Since almost everyone comes to North Korea by joining a group tour (or at least has to be accompanied by a local guide all the time), this is a site that everyone will end up for a photo opportunity. Once you have pictures taken at Kim Il-sung Square, you can tell your friends",
          "This is the standard view that most people have of the DPRK or North Korea. It is a vast square where most of the parades are held. Worth a visit just to understand this misunderstood country!",
          "At least, in size. Though, the monuments are quite nice, and if you are lucky enough to see a parade or a mass dancing event, it takes things to other dimension.",
          "The buildings are really grand Soviet era style with grande facades. It was hard for us to visit as the parade was being organised the following day, so we had to make do with seeing it from the edge.",
          "Appropriately sandwiched between the Grand Study Hall and Juche Tower and flanked by party buildings, this public square features prominently in media coverage concerning the DPRK. Rallies, dances, and the world famous (not sure if that\u2019s the right term) military parades all",
          "I don't know why, but you can feel reality here. I'm really glad that TripAdvisor allows everyone to leave review for any place. It is really great. You can use minimum imagination and everyone will get picture of place. I can not find exact restaurant but you can not miss it",
          "If you can overlook the potholed road running through it and all the painted spots where Soldiers are to stand it looks great. Tiananmen Square is more impressive, and in better condition.",
          "Having seen the parades in this square on the news, it is a must see when in the City. Grand and imposing",
          "Even when empty, the square is a sight to behold. However, it's most memorable when it's packed with people - be it for a mass dance rehearsal or a communist procession.",
          "Really quite boring and there is always constant smell of sewers and urine. Met a business colleague in the square and managed to get quite a few good photographs of the immediate area. Wouldn't recommend to anyone as it's just an open space for pigeons the play in.",
          "Such an iconic place is amazing to see in real life, there are often interesting activities going on here to see too.",
          "There were a couple of visits to Kim Il-Sung Square during my visit to Pyongyang. The square was built in 1954 and is immense but completely devoid of people apart from two coachloads of tourists making it feel eerily quiet. Kim Il-Sung Square is an incredible place to visit and",
          "You see it on TV you got to visit it as it is not as big as it looks on TV but well worth it. we were there just after one of the great days for the supreme leader",
          "When you see the military parades and mass dances on TV, if you're not lucky enough to go when a major event is happening, the empty square can be a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just me, but I found a lot of the other experiences in Pyongyang to be a lot more memorable.",
          "Apparently nothing breaks down in DPRK so I took a photo of a broken down Lorry and was promptly advised to delete it as nothing breaks down ever !!! Otherwise it's not a bad square not exactly saint mark's but ok (oh don't go into the shops and a that will get you in trouble",
          "We visited Kim Il-sung square during the national youth celebrations, and were treated to a mass performed by more than 20,000 students! We were free to roam the square while the dance took place, and even joined in with the students!",
          "North Korea is a very controversial country at the best of times but is worth the visit. You have to travel with guides at all times and it is not inexpensive. Yes there are restrictions and rules but as long as you follow them, you can have an amazing experience.",
          "This is the most importante square in Pyongyang! Its here the bigs parades (that we can wacth on TV) take place! Its very big and its surrounded by importante monuments as Juche Tower. On the floor its posible to see the white marks that indicates each place that participating",
          "Huge square which we often see in the news and pictures, the square is beautiful in that old soviet era kind of way, interesting to walk through and see the stone buildings and bright slogans.",
          "The major square in Pyongyang, a must-see when visiting. Your guide will definitly point out all major details.",
          "No matter what your opinions of the DPRK, you'll be impressed by the size of this square. Parades and dances occasionally take place here and they're an amazing sight. On other days, it seems eerily empty.",
          "The Kim Il-Sung Square is the scene for all those impressive parades of goose-stepping troops, tanks and mobile missile launchers, not to mention the hugely impressive choreographed dances of school children and other citizenry overwhelmed with joy at the opportunity to show",
          "This is the place for festival exhibitions, the main square on country, surrounded by impreswsive buildings.",
          "This is clearly set up to host grand displays of patriotism. Try to visit when something like that is happening.",
          "A fascinating representation of the dedication of the people of North Korea to their leaders. Travel is very guarded and always with guides.",
          "Before going to North Korea, i watch a lot of documentaries about the country. All featured this square but with thousands of people and tanks! amazing",
          "It's just a big dictators square. But lots of flag waving practising was going on the day we were there which allowed for selective photos and the odd wave with a local.",
          "Our group ended up here a couple of times. We were told that the dots painted on the ground were there so that massive groups could stand in orderly rows. We took a lot of pictures, since the icons on top of the buildings made for great backdrops.",
          "Very buetiful even though my boy, Kimmy had diarrhea at the front. This place was compeling, i saw feces on thr ground.",
          "Another most see and very classic and populace to visit in Pyongyang. Powerful and grand architecture and a very interesting history. Spotless and amazing. Recomended.",
          "Kim Il Sung sqare is a location of military parades and other big events. Mind dots and numbers on the floor and guess why they are there!",
          "It is a huge square surrounded by government buildings and museums. When we visited there were hardly any other people around which made it probably even more impressive. Worth the visit!",
          "Antropologically intersting place with nice buildings surrounding an enourmous square devoted to the Kim familiy. But where are the people?",
          "One big plot of land, with people sitting or standing or walking around. A very common entity in most communist countries. Think of Tiananmen square in China, and you think of Kim II-sung Square in DPRK",
          "If you are lucky, and it is very likely you will be, you will see thousands of schoolchildren practicing for the holidays.",
          "you could be anywhere in europe if you looked around the square. it is a huge open area, well designed, used for several ceremonial events. surrounded by the grand people's study house, some museums and other government offices, the square is a wonderful place to walk around. it",
          "Visits to the Kim Il Sung square happen frequently, you'll visit the natural history museum and most likely also the art museum which are on the same side of the square. The foreign ministry and other party buildings are located nearby, if you demonstrate an interest in politics",
          "Beautiful square, where on National Day, I saw several hundred couples dancing in the square. It is used as the place of the mass dances and various military parades.",
          "Was on the Kim Il-Sung square during Liberatioin Day (August 15th 2015). In the evening, thousands of couples were dancing on Korean music. Very impressing!!!",
          "We were here for the youth day mass dance and my mother reckoned up to 10,000 people, if this is the culture they are protecting through their insular policies the I totally understood it that night, I have never seen anything like it, and as one of only about 100 spectators I",
          "i was here on liberation day and at night massive amount of people dancing here was impressive, i even got the chance to dance with one of the ladies. like most socialist countries they all have a impressive square.",
          "At the 30th biggest square in the world, we were able to watch thousands of children rehearsing ahead of a huge military parade and anniversary in October. We were also able to share a Mass Dance in the square at night with tens of thousands of people enjoying their social event",
          "There are many dots painted on the ground, which are necessary for the military parades. I was lucky enough to see a mass dance here, this was absolutely great!",
          "This is the fulcrum of DPRK life and the huge socialist buildings and signs around the square are very impressive but the most beautiful thing was to be able to see a training of young people for the upcoming DPRK Foundation Anniversary from the Grand People's Study House",
          "My son and I visited the square as a required part of our itinerary. There is really nothing of interest in the square, and I would have avoided it if possible. We were really interested in the ancient gate and pavilion of the Pyongyang Fort which was a few minutes walk north of",
          "This is a large open air square off the main road. From there looking across the river is better. Not much else to see. One of many propaganda stops along the sponsored tours.",
          "you want to visit this place? I hope not. Kim Il-sung Square is a place for propaganda and no more than that. Your guide will admire Kim Il-sung and you will even get tired of that. You can see only what they want to show such as the Tower of the Juche Idea, the Tirumphal arch,",
          "While it is interesting to visit the square for its cultural value, overall there isn't much to see. This is the square that the military parades pass through so you might recognize it if you have seen one of these parades on TV.",
          "Very large square with a good view of the Juche Tower on the other side of the river, and the National Library... Cool to see and any tour will probably stop there",
          "During the day it's fairly quite around this area - if you are luck to attend an event here - it's fantastic. We saw some May Day dancing event - it was great watching the sunset in the main square.",
          "On my five-day trip to the DPRK we obviously stopped by Kim Il Sung Square. Very nice, nice to see the 'ordinary' (lol) people frolicking around on roller blades, etc. Wanted to interact with them, as when else do you get the chance? Needless to say got very short thrift by an",
          "I have been on the look for a property with a big enough backyard for my family. When I saw kimmy ill's square, I knew this was the deal. The backyard is spacious enough such that your three kids can parade their nukes should they decide to build some, its close to public",
          "The main square in Pyongyang. It is huge and impressive. The architecture of the buildings surrounding it is grand. I'd like to go back and take more pictures. We went first at night and then a few days later during the day. Picture opportunities are great for both.",
          "Pretty much the center of Pyongyang, this is a great place for photos. It's a huge square with no crowds which makes it surprisingly calm and peaceful.",
          "This square has been built to host many military parades and give the beholder a grand look. It is indeed and grand and also gives us a thought of the respect that their great leader commands.",
          "This is a pleasant square to walk in. It is spacious and not crowded. There are no shops, no restaurants, no clubs, no advertisements, no neon and no traffic. Kids enjoy roller skating here. A relaxing place. But it needs a few trees.",
          "Gigantic square in the center of Pyonyang that gives the sense of the grandeur of DPRK Establishment.",
          "It is the principal square of North Korea where political events, mass demonstration and meetings and parades have been held on official holidays and various occasions starting from the mass rally of Pyongyang citizens celebrating the victory in the Korean War on July 28th Juche",
          "Kim Il-sung Square is the type of attraction that is enjoyable to see once and take it all in, but after seeing The Square once you really have nothing to go back for, (Similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. You likely won't have a choice whether or not you're going here",
          "Merry children playing on Kim Il-sung Square in central Pyongyang with the Juche Tower in the background. This huge open square has been the venue for many large-scale parades and celebrations in honour of the dear leaders. Keep in mind that the huge Juche Tower may look like",
          "The above is my refrain every time I see the newscasts of the Square and the army and the adoring people worshiping their great (late) leader. What can I say? It is a big open space.",
          "The place where all the big parades take place on the important days in North Korea. On a non parade day its an open space for a wander with your guides.",
          "It is really strange walking around the square as there really isnt many locals around. A must when in North Korea",
          "The square with the marching troops and military hardware you normally see in the news. Strange feeling when you walk on it, but definitely worth it if you do visit Pyongyang.",
          "if you have ever seen a north korean military parade, this is where it happens, well worth a visit if not on your itinerary",
          "This is a nice place for a quick stop in Pyongyang. Two huge squares are split by a road with impressive buildings all around the perimeter. It was early evening when our tour group visited the Kim Il-sung square, and it was fairly quiet. It was really nice to see kids",
          "You won't need too long at this place. I visited in winter time so it was rather cold and there werent so many people around. Its a nice place to see some iconic North Korean landmark buildings. This is the square where they do a lot of their marches/parades/military displays.",
          "This large and open place is worth a visit. There are normally much people there, so you should have enough things and people to watch, to stay there for a while. It is also interesting to see a place which is often shown on tv.",
          "Nice to see the local kids doing 'normal' things like rollerblading in the square. Impressive Communist architecture too!",
          "When I visited it was a fairly warm, sunny autumn day in October, and the huge square looked impressive if pretty deserted. The Grand People's Study House dominates the Western side of the square with much less impressive govenment offices on the North and South sides. To the",
          "The square set up is like the China's Tiananmen square, good place to hold a parade for the national ceremony. Nice to take a stroll along the nearby riverside.",
          "Not much to see here unless thousands of soldiers and hundreds of military armored vehicles are rolling past.",
          "The square is smaller than Tienanmen and built for similar purposes. There are white dots on the ground where people line up for parades. Also, pictures of their leaders are visible on government buildings that surround the square. You get a good view of Juche Tower from",

        "wiki": "The Mangyongdae Funfair is an amusement park located in Mangyongdae-guyok, 12 kilometers from Pyongyang, North Korea. It has an area of 70 hectares including a funfair and wading pool. In fall, 2011 the funfair was reported to have little or no Korean patronage.  It has been alleged that there is a lack of genuine customers with many visitors being bussed in to the attraction. It had a roller coaster, which, while operational, was in poor repair. There is a merry-go-round and a ridable miniature railway.The dismal atmosphere and run-down condition of the funfair were severely criticized by Kim Jong-un, during an inspection in May, 2012.   Kim Jong-un ordered Choe Ryong-hae, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, and others, to spruce up the funfair and bring it into compliance with the requirements of the S\u014fn'gun era. Kim Jong-un used the occasion to emphasize the requirement that officials have the spirit of serving the people and must abandon outdated ideological points of view and outmoded work-styles.\n\n\n== Other parks ==\nThe Kaeson Youth Park is another amusement park in Pyongyang which also underwent innovation. The Taesongsan Fun Fair, opened in 1977, at the foot of Mount Taesong is another. The Pyongyang Folklore Park with an historical theme, also at Mount Taesong in Pyongyang, has been under construction since December, 2008. There are also folk parks in Sukchon, South Pyongan Province and Sariwon, North Hwanghae Province. South Korean folk parks with an historical theme such as Korean Folk Village are popular attractions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of amusement parks in North Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMangyongdae Fun Fair.

        "wiki": "A military parade is a formation of soldiers whose movement is restricted by close-order manoeuvering known as drilling or marching. The military parade is now almost entirely ceremonial, though soldiers from time immemorial up until the late 19th century fought in formation. Massed parades may also hold a role for propaganda purposes, being used to exhibit the apparent military strength of one's nation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe terminology comes from the tradition of close order formation combat, in which soldiers were held in very strict formations as to maximise their combat effectiveness. Formation combat was used as an alternative to m\u00eal\u00e9e combat, and required strict discipline in the ranks and competent officers. As long as their formations could be maintained, regular troops could maintain a significant advantage over less organised opponents. \nNevertheless, military parades are not to be confused with the military show of force.Although the firepower of breechloading rifles and machine guns long ago rendered close formations in battle suicidal, modern armies still use parades for ceremonial purposes or in non-combat environments for their efficiency, ease of organization and encouragement of discipline. Roughly synonymous are \"drill\" and \"march\". The English word \"drill\" is of Middle Dutch origin, dating from the 16th-century drill of the Dutch army of prince Maurice of Orange, which was widely copied throughout Europe at the time, decreasing the volley time of musket formations.\nIn ancient times, drilling increased in importance when men stopped fighting as individuals and began to fight together as units. Drilling as a vital component of a war machine further increased with the increases in the size of armies, for example, when Phillip II of Macedon disciplined his army so they could swiftly form the phalanxes that were so critical to his successes as a general. Military drilling later was used by the Roman Army to maximise efficiency and deadliness throughout their long history. After the fall of the empire, the Dark Ages set in Europe, most feudal lords more heavily relied on peasant levies and their wealthy knights to fight their wars, the knights, for the most part, reverting to fighting as individuals. Massed military drilling was used mostly by only the foremost armies and nations, such as the Normans.\nThe U.S. drill is based on the contributions of Baron von Steuben, a Prussian Army officer who served in the Continental Army. During the winter quarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, von Steuben taught a model company of 100 soldiers musket drill. These soldiers, in turn, taught the remainder of the Continental Army.\nThe most familiar form of melee weapon and unarmed combat drill in the modern world is the Kata and the Hyung in Eastern martial arts. However, there were once similar drills in the martial training of warriors in all cultures worldwide. They all had exactly the same purpose, to make instinctive an appropriate reaction to an attack or opening by conditioning the mind and body, through repeated and constant repetition of a series of actions (building up muscle memory). Probably one of the last survivors of such drills in the Western martial tradition are the reaction drills and rhythm exercises in the modern sport of fencing.\n\nThe oldest, largest and most famous regular military parade in Europe is the Bastille Day Military Parade which is held each 14 July, on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, during France's national day celebrations.\n\n\n== Rationale ==\n\nA military drill is memorizing certain actions through repetition until the action is instinctive to the soldiers being drilled. Complex actions are broken down into simpler ones which can be practiced in isolation so when the whole is put together the desired results are achieved. Such is necessary for a fighting force to perform at maximum efficiency in all manner of situations. However, depending on the army and the drills it adopts, drilling may destroy flexibility and initiative in exchange for predictability and cohesion.\nRecruits in most modern militaries are taught drill to teach them how to work and move as a team. In addition, formations are still used in riot control, where m\u00eal\u00e9e combat is still the norm.\n\n\n== Types of military parades ==\nFlypast\nVictory parade\nNaval parade\n\n\n== Military marching commands ==\n\n\n== Modern era ==\n\nDrill is today used to demonstrate discipline and cohesion in a modern military force. Large military parades are today held on major holidays and military events around the world. It usually held on occasions of national importance such as a country's independence day, and therefore is presided over by the head of state who, in most cases, is the commander in chief of the combined national military forces of that country. Today, military parades include all aspects of military drill, from an exhibition drill of precision drill teams and military bands (in addition to the occasional corps of drums, fanfare band, and/or drum and bugle corps), as well as an exhibition of military weapons such as a mobile column, the occasional mounted cavalry column (led by a mounted band), a naval parade, and a fly past by the country's air force. When on parade, most of the participating soldiers wear their ceremonial uniforms and carry the standards/colours of their respective battalions/regiments/corps/academies. In many countries, the military contingent is joined by contingents from youth cadet organizations, personnel from the police and fire services and by occasion jail and border services, youth police and fire cadets, veterans and personnel of the civil service.\n\n\n=== By country ===\n\n\n==== Albania ====\nAlbania has long been influenced by Greek and Italian influences and even Soviet/Russian tradition. During the era of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Liberation Day, which then the main national holiday, was celebrated with a military parade of the Albanian People's Army on Tirana's D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard. These parades have been held in 1954, 1959, 1964, 1974, 1984 and 1989. They usually consist of veterans, schoolchildren, militiamen alongside regular force personnel.Today, military parades of the Albanian Armed Forces are held on Albanian Flag Day and Constitution Day on 28 November. One of the more notable modern military parades was held on the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania, in which a special unit of 65 soldiers from the Kosovo Security Force, as well as other foreign contingents, participated. The other took place on 4 December 2007 in honor of the 95th anniversary of the Albanian Armed Forces.\n\n\n==== Argentina ====\nArgentina's long history of military parades are a heritage inherited from the times of the Spanish colonial Viceroyality of Rio de la Plata, with influences from Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. Today the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic, together with the paramilitary Argentine National Gendarmerie and Argentine Naval Prefecture hosts massive military parades featuring armed companies, cadets, and military bands on the following days (national events unless otherwise noted):\n\nJanuary 24 - anniversary of the beginning of the Crossing of the Andes (local commemoration)\nFebruary 3 - anniversary of the Battle of San Lorenzo (local commemoration)\nApril 2 - Falklands War Veterans' Day\nMay 10 - anniversary of Air Force baptism of fire in the Falklands War\nMay 17 - Navy Day, anniversary of the victory at the Battle of Buceo\nMay 25 - First National Government Anniversary Day\nMay 29 - Army Day\nJune 17 -  General Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes Memorial Day (local commemoration)\nJune 20 - Flag Day\nJune 30 - Naval Prefecture Day\nJuly 9 - Independence Day\nJuly 28 - National Gendarmerie Day\nAugust 10 - Air Force Day\nSeptember 24 - Battle of Tucuman Day (local commemoration)\nNovember 20 - National Sovereignty Day\n\n\n==== Australia and New Zealand ====\nAs both Commonwealth realms, Australia and New Zealand share the customs and traditions of parades of the British Armed Forces. The friendship and cooperation of the defence services of both countries can be seen in the annual Anzac Day parades every 25 April, in memory of the namesake Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, which was heavily involved in the long Battle of Gallipoli and were the first Allied forces to land there on that day in 1915. On this day, in many major cities in these two countries, parades are held involving personnel of both the Australian Defence Force and the New Zealand Defence Force, veterans' organizations, cadet organizations, and other youth uniformed groups and personnel of the police and fire services, as well as students of schools and universities honoring many of their fallen alumni of the long campaign.\nParades are also held jointly in these two countries on 11 November, Remembrance Day.\nAside from these two days, the schedule of annual military and civil parades held in these two countries is as follows:\n\nFor parades in Australia:\nNational level parades are held on:\n26 January, Australia Day\nThe second  Monday of June, the Queen's Birthday, marked in most of Eastern Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory\ntypically the last Monday of September or the first Monday of October, Queen's Birthday Holiday for Western Australia\n1st Monday in October, Queen's Birthday Holiday for Queensland\nLocal parades involving armed forces, police and fire personnel are held on:\n2nd Monday in March in the ACT, Canberra Day\n6 June in Queensland, Queensland Day\nfirst Monday in June in Western Australia, Western Australia Day\nfirst working day after Christmas Day, Proclamation Day in South Australia\nParades are also held in the following cases:\nduring change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet passing out parades and regimental anniversaries within the service branches of the ADF and all military academies\nDuring holiday parades held in major cities as can be permitted by the commander of the unit taking part, including:\nthe AFL Grand Final Parade in Melbourne\nFor parades in New Zealand:\nNational level parades are held on:\n6 February, Waitangi Day\non the 1st Monday in June, the Queen's Birthday\nLocal parades involving armed forces, police, and fire personnel are held within the anniversary days of the former Provinces of New Zealand, which were abolished in 1876, the days of which are as set by their respective district and city governments.\nChange of command, retirement, and recruit and cadet graduation parades, together with regimental anniversary parades, are also held occasionally within the service branches of the NZDF and its training institutions.\n\n\n==== Bangladesh ====\nThe Bangladesh Armed Forces parade tradition was inherited from both the Pakistan and British Armed Forces as its first infantry unit, the East Bengal Regiment, was raised in then East Pakistan 1948 from Bengali servicemen who served in the former British Indian Army, whose drills were similar to those in the rest of the Commonwealth. Today the Armed Forces, together with Border Guards Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Police, Bangladesh Jail, Bangladesh Ansar, Bangladesh Fire Service & Civil Defence and the youth cadets under the Bangladesh National Cadet Corps, marches on ceremonial parades held on the following occasions:\n\n26 March, Independence Day\n21 November, Armed Forces Day\n16 December, Victory Day\nOn the occasion of change of command and passing out parades in all academies, cadet colleges and training institutions of the uniformed organizations\n\n\n==== Bolivia ====\nUniquely, the parade tradition of the Bolivian Armed Forces is similar to those of Prussia and the German Empire but with the difference that the current march step is at slow time, to enable a knee-high goose step when on the march for most units (others, including recruit battalions and civilian students of the Military Engineering School, march in quick time without the goosestep and following the Bundeswehr practice). The Prussian tradition was introduced to the country in the early 1900s thanks to German and Chilean instructors and officers. Today, alongside the Bolivian National Police Corps, the Armed Forces marches in public parades in the following holidays:\n\nJanuary 22, Plurinational State of Bolivia Anniversary\nMarch 23, Day of the Sea\nAugust 6, Independence Day\nAugust 7, Armed Forces Day\nOctober 12, Air Force Day\nNovember 6, Navy Day\nNovember 10, Army Day\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\nAs a former Portugese colonial possesion till independence in 1822, Brazil has almost identical traditions of military parades with the Portuguese Armed Forces with added Spanish and Dutch elements due to the long history of the lands that would become the present day country, with additional influences from France, Germany and Italy. For many years from the Imperial era till today Brazil has witnessed parade after parade held on major national and regional holidays, a tradition maintained till today by the Brazilian Armed Forces. Since the 1960s high-stepping has been a prominent part of parades hosted by the armed forces, a tradition carried over from Portugal, Turkey and Uruguay.\nToday major parades by the Armed Forces and its veterans are held on the following occasions:\n\nFederal holidays and service holidays marked by the Armed Forces as well as anniversaries of service arms\nApril 10, Corps of Engineers Day\nApril 12, Army Logistics Support Day\nApril 19, Army Day\nApril 21, Tiradentes Day (also Brasilia Foundation Day and Minas Gerais Day)\nMay 5, Signal Corps Day\nMay 10, Cavalry Day\nMay 24, Infantry Day\nJune 10, Artillery Day\nJune 11, Navy Day\nAugust 23, Air Force Logistics Day\nAugust 25, Day of the Brazilian Soldier\nAugust 28, Naval Aviation Day\nSeptember 7, Independence Day\nOctober 23, Aviators' Day\nNovember 15, Day of the Proclamation of the Republic\nNovember 19, Flag Day\nDecember 13, Day of the Brazilian Sailor\nState and territorial holidays\nJanuary 4, Rond\u00f4nia Day\nMarch 6, anniversary of the beginning of the Pernambucan revolt\nMarch 25, Ceara Slavery Abolition Day\nApril 23, Saint George's Day (in Rio de Janeiro state only)\nJune 15, Acre State Anniversary Day\nJuly 2, Bahia Independence Day\nJuly 8, Sergipe Political Emancipation Day\nJuly 9, anniversary of the outbreak of the 1932 Sao Paulo Constitutionalist Revolution\nJuly 28, Maranh\u00e3o Admission Day\nAugust 5, Para\u00edba Day\nAugust 7, Rio Grande de Norte Day\nAugust 11, Santa Catarina Day\nSeptember 5, Amazonas State Anniversary Day\nSeptember 13, Amap\u00e1 Day\nSeptember 16, Alagoas Day\nSeptember 20, Day of the Gauchos of Rio Grande do Sul\nOctober 5, Roraima Day and Tocantis Day (within the aformentioned states)\nOctober 11, anniversary of the establishment of Mato Grosso do Sul\nOctober 19, Piau\u00ed State Anniversary\nOctober 23, Goias State Anniversary\nDecember 19, Paran\u00e1 State Anniversary\nDuring unitwide anniversaries and remembrance days of important battles of the Armed Forces\nDuring change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet graduation parades within the service branches of the armed forces and all military academies and high schools\nDuring anniversaries and holidays marked by the cities and towns of Brazil\nOn January 1, day of the presidential inauguration ceremony\nDuring inauguration ceremonies of state governors, city and municipal chief executivesAlongside the armed forces the following uniformed organizations, together with representatives from educational institutions and athletes, also participate in every parade:\n\nNational Public Security Force\nFederal Police of Brazil\nFederal Highway Police\nFederal Railroad Police\nNational Prison Department\nall state Military Police formations\nall state Military Firefighters Corps\nAll state Civil Police formations\nAll Municipal Guards formations of cities and towns\nState, city and municipal civilian fire services and volunteer fire units\n\n\n==== Canada ====\nWithin Canada, the now tri-service Ceremonial Guard performs the marchpast for senior dignitaries of the Canadian Armed Forces during change of command ceremonies and state arrival ceremonies, typically held in Ottawa, the national capital. The two Primary Reserve Canadian Army regiments that typically provide personnel for the guard, the Governor General's Foot Guards and The Canadian Grenadier Guards, together with the Governor General's Horse Guards and guard of honour detachments from both the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force take part in these events. In addition, the CG and optionally both the GGHG and the CGG take part in military parades such as the more common Trooping the Colour, also in Ottawa and special parades during the jubilee years of the monarch or of a national foundation. The CAF personnel, as well as the Canadian Cadet Organizations and military veterans also parade during national holidays such as Remembrance Day, Victoria Day, Canada Day or Canadian Forces Day, as well as during parades celebrating anniversaries of regiments, brigade groups or wings, and divisional level formations and passing out parades of the Royal Military College of Canada, Royal Military College Saint-Jean and recruit training bases, as well as in local holidays in the provinces and major cities. Across the country, the annual Warriors Day military parade has since 1921, been a traditional event of the Canadian National Exhibition. It is specifically devoted to formally recognizing veterans of the CF. Like in the UK, the regimental march of the unit being honored is played by the band and/or pipe band if present.\n\n\n==== Chile ====\nThe tradition of military parades in Chile has origins not just in Spanish tradition, but also a mix between those of France, the United Kingdom, and particularly Germany, given the fact that Imperial German Army officers trained the army and navy in the mid-1890s in the Prussian-German traditions of military parades that are continued until today.\nCurrently, the Chilean Armed Forces and the Carabineros de Chile hold public parades in front of state leaders and the public on\n\n21 May - Navy Day - honoring the fallen of the 1879 Battle of Iquique, also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the Chilean Navy\n19 September - Army Day - while honoring the 1810 anniversary of the formal inauguration of the First Government Junta, is also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the Chilean ArmyLocal level parades are marked on the following days aside from 21 May:\n\n4 February - anniversary of the victorious Capture of Valdivia\n17 February  - anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Chacabuco\n21 March - Air Force Day\n2 April - anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Maipu\n27 April - Carabineros Day\n7 June - anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Arica\n16 June - Chilean Marine Corps Day\n9 July  - Flag Day\n20 August - birthday of Bernardo O'Higgins\n18 September - Independence Day\n2 October - anniversary of the Battle of Rancagua\n2 November - anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Pisagua\n30 November - Chilean Gendarmerie Day\n\n\n==== China ====\nThe first military parade on the Chinese mainland can be dated to over 4,000 years ago, when Yu the Great, a legendary ruler in ancient China, hosted a gathering of tribal forces from northern and southern China.\n\n\n===== People's Republic of China =====\n\nThe People's Republic of China holds extraordinary military parades in Beijing to celebrate National Day. The first parade of this nature took place right after the Proclamation of the People's Republic of China by Chairman Mao Zedong on 1 October 1949. Originally celebrated annually, the parade was suspended in 1960, before returning in 1984 to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is now held to mark every tenth anniversary, starting in 1999. Parades were also held in 1964, 1966, 1969 and 1970.In 2015, China held a military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Victory over Japan. This was the first time China held a military parade for an event other than its National Day. It is currently unknown if China will continue to celebrate the end of World War II, through.\nIn 2017, the 90th anniversary since the Nanchang Uprising and the beginning of the People's Liberation Army was marked by a military parade, the first time ever that a military parade had been held in its honor and the first time it was held outside of the capital, having been held at Zhurihe Training Base in Inner Mongolia under the direction of General Han Weiguo of the Central Theater Command. This was also the first field parade to take place since September 1981 when a parade consisting of troops participating in an excersise in Zhangjiakou in the presence of Deng Xiaoping to commemorate Deng's assumption to the post of Chairman of the Central Military Commission. During that parade, Deng reportedly said \"Let\u2019s hold a large-scale one if we are to hold a military exercise, so that it can be of use\" in reference to the size of the parade. Naval parades have also been reintroduced in recent years with a parade (which was the biggest naval review since 1949 and according to the Chinese government, the biggest in 600 years.) being held in the South China Sea in 2018 and a parade for the platinum jubilee of the People's Liberation Army Navy being held in early 2019.\nSmaller scale parades are also periodically held in Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet and Xinjiang. Every year on 10 March (Tibetan Uprising Day), a military parade in Lhasa to mark the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan rebellion. The first military parades in the HKSAR and the MSAR took place on their first and fifth anniversaries in 1998 and 2004 respectively.\n\n\n===== Republic of China =====\nHowever, in the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Republic of China Armed Forces held its national parades in Taipei from 1949 until 1991 during the Double Ten Day celebrations. This practice was abandoned in 1991 though parades were recently held every five years beginning in 2011 during the Xinhai Revolution centenary and again in 2016. Special parades were held outside Taipei in 1995 and 2015 marking the 50th and 70th anniversaries, respectively, of both the Allied victory in the Second World War and the conclusion of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\n\n==== Colombia ====\nBoth the Military Forces of Colombia and the National Police of Colombia hold important national parades to celebrate the anniversary of national independence as well as of the Armed Forces. Such parades are a mix of the Spanish, German, French, American and British influences owing to the long history of the country's military and police forces. National level parades are held on:\n\nFebruary 15 - Air Force Day\nJuly 20 - Independence Day\nJuly 24 - Navy Day\nAugust 7 - Army Day and Battle of Boyaca Victory Day\nNovember 15 - National Police DayLocal level parades by the personnel and veterans of the armed forces and police are held on the following:\n\nApril 7 - Barranquilla Day\nJuly 3 - Cali Independence Day\nNovember 11 - Cartagena Independence Day\n\n\n==== Cuba ====\nThe Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces generally holds military parades in honor of the Day of the Cuban Armed Forces and the Triumph of the Revolution on Havana's Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n. The first parade took place in 1960 for the latter event and over time, importance was transferred to Armed Forces Day in relation to military parades. In 2011, a special honor parade was held on April 16 to commemorate the golden jubilee since the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. The largest parade to be held took place in December 1986 in honor of the 30th anniversary of the revolution, in which General Humberto Ortega from Nicaragua, as well as officials from the Soviet Union, attended. The diamond jubilee parade planned for 2016 was postponed for 1 month due to the death and state funeral of Fidel Castro, and took place during the Victory Day celebrations on 2 January 2017.\n\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n\nLarge mlitary parades in the Czech Republic are today held every 10 years in the capital of Prague, encompassing personnel from the Czech Army and the Police of the Czech Republic. The first of these parades occurred in 2008 in honor of the founding of Czechoslovakia on 28 October 1918. Another one took place in 2018 and included foreign troops.Prior to 1918, military parades followed the tradition of their larger sovereign entity, including the military tradition of Austria-Hungary. Regular military parades were held during the period of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, with the first parades being organized in the 1950s. The first parade of the Czechoslovak People's Army (\u010cSLA) took place in 1951 in Letn\u00e1. Since then, parades were held every five years on 9 May to mark the end of World War II and the Liberation of Czechoslovakia. To honor the latter's celebrations, the State Anthem of the Soviet Union would be performed by the massed bands on parade preceded by the Czechoslovakian national anthem. The last of these parades took place in 1985.\n\n\n==== Ecuador ====\nBoth the Armed Forces of Ecuador and the National Police of Ecuador hold important national parades to celebrate the anniversaries of national independence as well as of the Armed Forces and Police. National level parades are held on the following days:\n\nFebruary 27 - Army Day\nMay 24 - Armed Forces Day, the anniversary of the victory in the 1822 Battle of Pichincha\nJuly 26 - Navy Day\nAugust 10 - the anniversary of the Luz de America\nOctober 9 - Guayaquil Independence Day\nOctober 27 - Air Force Day\nNovember 3 - Cueca Independence Day\nNovember 18 - Loja Independence DayLocal military and police parades are held on a major city and provincial anniversaries.\n\n\n==== Finland ====\nThe parade traditions of Finland can be traced to the Swedish period, and later on during Russian administration, wherein the local formations adopted a few of the Russian parade traditions in tandem with the Swedish tradition and local practices. Today both the Finnish Defence Forces, together with the Territorial Forces companies of Finnish regions, the National Defence Training Association of Finland, the Finnish Border Guard and the Police of Finland all host military parades held every year on the following dates:\n\nMay 16, Anniversary of the 1918 Valkoisten Voitonparaati and the termination of the Finnish Civil War\nJune 4, Defence Forces Flag Day and birthday of Marshal of Finland Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim\nDecember 6, Independence DayIn case of the latter two celebrations the national parades are held in a host city selected for the year, and may include local military and police formations.\n\n\n==== France ====\nThe annual military parade in the French capital of Paris is held on July 14 during the Bastille Day holiday. It is currently the oldest and largest military parade on the European continent. It is held on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and passes from l'Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. Bastille Day parades are also held in smaller garrison towns such as Toulon and Belfort. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the French Republican Guard regularly performs ceremonial marchpasts in is role as the guard of honour for the President of the French Republic. Like the British, many French units have the ability to march in quick time, while only one - the French Foreign Legion - marches uniquely in slow time, while another unit of the armed forces marches in very quick time and that is of the Army's Chasseurs, especially its Chasseurs alpins.\nIn addition to the Armed Forces (including the National Guard) and the occasional participation of its veterans, the following take part in the national parade:\n\nNational Police\nFire services of the Ministry of the Interior\nSecurity Service of the Ministry of the Interior\nFrench Prisons Service\nDirectorate-General of Customs and Indirect TaxesLocal parades are held on the following days:\n\nMay 8 - Victory in Europe Day\nNovember 11 - Armistice Day\nAnniversaries of important battles fought by the French Armed Forces\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nGermany has had a long tradition of military parades dating back to the days of Kingdom of Prussia and its army and navy. It was the Prussians who invented the goose step, a style of marching that was used in many German armies as well as in the militaries of various countries, which were instructed by Prussian military training officers and instructors from the 19th century to the early 20th. Its traditions were also carried on in a number of former crown dominions in Prussian lands, including Hanover and the Rhineland, as well as in the allied Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Kingdom of Saxony, the grand duchies, duchies and principalities, and the city-state military forces of Bremen and Hamburg. In Bavaria, a mix of the Prussian and Austrian practice in tandem with its local traditions was kept.\nDuring the Nazi era, military parades were commonplace as they were held as a sort of victory parade for the German Wehrmacht as they invaded countries before and during the Second World War, as well as an expression of national pride in the armed forces, who together with the SS and the SA, as well as the other Nazi party uniformed organizations, formed part of the parades in the mid 1930s. The first major parades took place in Nuremberg in September 1938 and Adolf Hitler's 50th birthday in April 1939. In the months Immediately after the German invasion of Poland, a joint German\u2013Soviet military parade took place in Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus). In Allied-occupied Germany, the major powers held parades through the center of Berlin to honor their victory. These include the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, 1945 British Berlin Victory Parade and Berlin Victory Parade of 1946.\nIn the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR), parades were held according to the Russian standard, although the Soviet Army allowed the East Germans, thru the National People's Army and the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, to use the Prussian tradition, something that had been dropped by their West German counterparts in the 50s. In the GDR, parades were held on the following occasions:\n\nNVA Day (3 March)\nInternational Workers' Day (1 May)\nTag der Befreiung (8 May)\nTag der Republik (7 October)The first parade took place on 1 May 1956 in the presence of President Wilhelm Pieck. In the 60s and early 70s, parades took place on the western half of the Palace of the Republic, which was intended as a military parade ground, even though tremors from the heavy vehicles proved dangerous due to the glass facade. By 1979, the western half was used mainly as a parking lot and military parades were moved to Karl-Marx-Allee in central Berlin. A special parade was held on 13 August 1986 to mark the silver jubilee since construction on the Berlin Wall began, and the parade involved not just the NVA and the Grenztruppen but also the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment and battalions of the Combat Groups of the Working Class. \n\nIn 1969, the first military parade of West Germany and later the entire Federal Republic of Germany was held on the N\u00fcrburgring in the town of N\u00fcrburg, Rhineland-Palatinate. It took place on 6 June 1969 and was held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was attended by Kurt Georg Kiesinger in his position as Federal Chancellor of Germany. Participating foreign and national units included those from the Bundeswehr, Canadian Forces Europe, United States Army Europe, as well as army contingents from France and the United Kingdom. Allied parades were also held later in the country's 40-year existence.\nToday, military parades are held on the following holidays on a smaller scale:\n\nRemembrance Day of July 20\nGerman Unity Day (October 3)\nPassing out parades of NCO training schools and officer training institutions\n\n\n==== Greece ====\nThe long history of the Hellenic Armed Forces and the role played in the defense and progress of the country are recalled in splendid and grand military parades that are held in major cities in the country following a hybrid of the British, French, Danish and German traditions on the following dates:\n\n25 March - Independence Day\n28 October - Ohi Day\nOn Liberation Days of major cities and towns, honoring the Greek fallen of the Second World War and the later Greek Civil War\n\n\n==== India ====\nThe tradition of military parades in India dates back to the medieval times as celebrations to honor Hindu gods in gratitude to victories against enemies. By the time of the Mughal Empire, with the introduction of gunpower weapons came the first European settlers, the Portuguese, in what is now Daman and Diu and Goa states, and the Portuguese Army, who introduced the modern form of parades to this country. These followed by servicemen from what is now The Netherlands, Ancien Regime France and the United Kingdom thru the East India Company (from the 17th century) and beginning from the 19th century the British Army, Royal Marines and the Royal Navy. Between these four countries, it was the UK that influenced the Indian military ceremonial tradition the most, as Hindu, Sikh, Tamil and Gurkha regiments, as well as a number of regiments from other races, whether be infantry, cavalry, artillery or engineers, alongside locally recruited seamen, were instructed in the British parade drill with adaptations to Indian conditions. They maintain the very same traditions today in the current Indian Armed Forces, and the current drills are a modernized form of those used beginning in 1895, the year of the foundation of the modern Indian Army, with parades having been held during the Delhi Durbars of 1903 and 1911 as well as during the King's Official Birthday in June.\nSince 1951 the Republic Day Parade has held annually in Delhi to mark India's Republic Day, celebrating the enactment in that day in 1950 of the Constitution of India. It is the country's principal military parade honoring the Armed Forces for its long record of service to the country and is also a showcase of the achievements of India's defence industry, with a number of vehicles and aircraft featured being locally produced by factories under the Ministry of Defence and by local defense production firms. Parades are also held on the service holidays of the Armed Forces:\n\n15 January, Army Day\n8 October, Air Force Day\n4 December, Navy DayIn 2020, Captain Tania Shergill became the first female Parade Adjutant to lead a contingent at an Army Day parade.Alongside the Armed Forces and its veterans the national Republic Day Parade in Delhi, as well as regional parades held on this day and on 15 August, Independence Day, features the participation of the following uniformed organizations:\n\nNational Cadet Corps\nYouth representatives of the National Service Scheme\nIndian Coast Guard\nAssam Rifles\nall state and territorial police forces, including State Armed Police\nBorder Security Force\nIndo-Tibetan Border Police\nSashastra Seema Bal\nNational Security Guard\nCentral Industrial Security Force\nCentral Reserve Police Force\nRailway Protection Force\nall municipal, city, state and territorial fire services\n\n\n==== Korea ====\n\n\n===== North Korea =====\n\nAll military parades of the Korean People's Army (KPA) and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards (WPRG) are centered in the national capital of Pyongyang and have a long tradition that goes back to the DPRK's establishment in 1948. Between 1993 and 2011, the DPRK held over a dozen military parades, which was frequent compared to the 1960s\u201380s, during which only three parades were held. Known for its elaborate military drill, the country holds military parades annually on different dates (especially on jubilee years), which feature a combination of Chinese and Russian techniques. North Korean military parades are held on the following dates:\n\n8 February \u2013 Military Foundation Day\n15 April \u2013 Day of the Sun\n25 April \u2013 Revolutionary Army Day\n27 July \u2013 Day of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War\n15 August \u2013 Liberation Day\n9 September \u2013 Day of the Foundation of the Republic\n10 October \u2013 Party Foundation Day\nRehearsals for these parades usually take place 3\u20136 weeks prior to the actual parade at the Mirim Parade Training Facility in the capital. The actual parades are held in the capital's Kim Il-sung Square.\nIn addition, non-jubilee holiday parades have been mounted on the grounds of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun on these days plus on:\n\n16 February \u2013 Day of the Shining Star\n25 August \u2013 Day of Songun\n21 December \u2013 Death Anniversary of Kim Jong-il\n\n\n===== South Korea =====\nThe tradition of parades in South Korea began in 1946, with the first ever parades of what is now the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, alongside personnel of the United States Forces Korea, whose traditions would shape the young armed forces' parade and ceremonial practices till this day mixed with the Japanese practice (due to the long period of Japanese rule over the peninsula). Today, that tradition is mixed with those of the other armed services under United Nations Command that fought with them against the KPA, the People's Volunteer Army and the Soviet Air Forces during the Korean War. The parade tradition is also coupled as a showcase for the national defense industry as well, with many of the military equipment being featured being of national manufacture, and locally composed military marches being featured in the repertoire of the military bands that are a staple of these events.\nAs of the present the ROKAF marches in public parades in the following occasions:\n\nMarch 1, Day of the Independence Movement\nApril 13, Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea Foundation Day\nApril 15, Republic of Korea Marine Corps Birthday\nJune 6, Memorial Day\nJune 25, anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War\nJuly 27, anniversary of the Korean War Armstice of 1953\nAugust 15, National Liberation Day of Korea\nSeptember 5, Republic of Korea Army Day\nOctober 1, Armed Forces Day (principal holiday of the Armed Forces) and Air Force Day\nOctober 3, Gaecheonjeol\nNovember 11, Republic of Korea Navy Day\nOn the occasion of change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet graduation parades within the service branches of the armed forces, military academies, all officer candidate schools and recruit training institutions\nOn the occasion of the inaugurations of the President of South KoreaThe October 1 parade and related celebrations, while being not a public holiday but a National Flag Raising Day mandated by law, serve as the principal day of gratitude to the ROKAF and its veterans for service to the nation at large and to all Koreans abroad, and thus the ROKAF only marches in public parades on this day with Seoul, the national capital, hosting the national parades (large major parades on this day are held every 5th year since the 1948 foundation of the republic, a tradition that began in 1998). On other holidays, the following organizations march with the armed forces, all cadet formations under the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (South Korea) and the Republic of Korea Reserve Forces:\n\nNational Police Agency\nKorea Coast Guard\nNational Fire Agency of the Republic of Korea\nAll local and regional firefighting services\nKorea Forest Service\nKorea Customs Service\nRailway Police of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport\nKorea Immigration Service\nKorea Scout Association\nGirl Scouts Korea\nForeign armed forces' veterans organizations stationed within the republic\n\n\n==== Mongolia ====\nMilitary parades in Mongolia have a long tradition that dates back to the era of the Mongol Empire. Today they closely follow the Russian model with some modifications such as trooping of the Flag of Mongolia in a car rather than by foot. A Dangjiren is based on a cavalry military parade of the Mongols that were held in the 17th century.The first official military parade in Communist Mongolia took place in 1921 in honor of the victories of Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar in the People's Revolution. The anniversary parades that followed have been held on jubilee years (specifically in 1946, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986 and 1991). After 1991, the practice was abandoned with the exception of 1996 when a parade in the National Sports Stadium commemorated the 790th anniversary of the founding of Mongolia and the 75th anniversary of the People's Revolution. After a 9-year break, the 2005 inauguration ceremony of Nambaryn Enkhbayar served as an event to hold a military parade on the central square. This took place again in 2009 for the inauguration of Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. That same year, State Flag Day was introduced as a national holiday, which would also be celebrated with a parade.Military parades of the Mongolian Armed Forces on S\u00fckhbaatar Square take place on the following occasions:\n18 March \u2013 Soldiers Day\n10 July \u2013 Mongolian State Flag Day\n1 September \u2013 Anniversary of the Battle of Khalkin Gol\nInauguration of the President of Mongolia\nGraduations of the National Defense UniversityDuring Mongolia's socialist period, annual civil/military parades of the Mongolian People's Army took place until 1991, celebrating the following occasions:\n\n1 May \u2013 International Workers Day\n11 July \u2013 Day of the People's Revolution of 1921\n7 November \u2013 October Revolution DayDuring these events, party and government leaders were viewed ascending to the top of S\u00fckhbaatar's Mausoleum to take the salute.\nAlongside the Armed Forces today's parades also involve personnel of the National Police Agency, the Internal Troops of Mongolia, the General Authority for Border Protection and the National Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\n==== Paraguay ====\nIt was the armed services of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay that helped develop the traditions of military parades in Paraguay following the devastating Paraguayan War, resulting in the introduction of certain traditions beginning in the early 20th century, which would later be infused with German, Italian and French influence. Before that war, however, they were quite few parades with primarily Spanish influences. The first major parade ever to be held in the 20th century in this country was on August 22, 1935, celebrating the victory won in the Chaco War against the Bolivian Armed Forces. In the 1940s and 50s, German goose-steping had been adopted in a limited scale thanks to Chilean instructors in the Francisco Lopez Military Academy, the Acosta \u00d1u Military High School and the National Police Academy.\nToday the Armed Forces of Paraguay stages massive military parades in Asunci\u00f3n, the national capital, together with the Police on the following days:\n\nMay 14, Independence Day\nJune 12, Chaco War Victory Day\nJuly 24, Army Day\nSeptember 12, Navy Day\nSeptember 22, Victory Day in the Battle of Curupayty\nSeptember 29, Victory Day in the Battle of Boqueron\nNovember 6, Air Force DayIn addition, a local parade is held every August 15 in honor of the anniversary of the foundation of the city of Asunci\u00f3n and the Catholic Feast of the Assumption of Mary. Almost all parades are televised nationally.\n\n\n==== Peru ====\nThe Peruvian Armed Forces and the National Police of Peru holds the yearly Great Military Parade of Peru every July 29 in Lima as the armed services' way of honoring the anniversary of national independence and the role they have played in shaping the history of the country. Together with these two services the Peruvian Volunteer Firefighters Corps and Peruvian National Penitentiary Institute also take part as well. Local level Independence Day parades are held on pre-determined days before July 28 and 29 as set by their respective local governments.\nParades held by service personnel and veterans of the armed forces are also marked on:\n\nJune 7 - Flag Day and Battle of Arica Memorial Day\nJune 26 - Air Force Day\nSeptember 24 - Armed Forces Day\nOctober 8 - Navy Day\nDecember 9  - Army Day and the anniversary of the Battle of Ayacucho\n\n\n==== Philippines ====\nThe tradition of military parades in the Philippines traces its origins to the military parades held since the late 1700s in honor of the inaugurations of the Governors General of the Philippines, with troops provided by formations of the Spanish Army, Spanish Navy and the Spanish Marine Infantry, manned by personnel from Spain and her other colonies and locally recruited personnel. Parades were also held on the anniversaries of members of the Spanish royal family and important anniversaries. It was these parades that would model the revolutionary armed forces of the young country, made up of the young Philippine Revolutionary Army and local pro-independence militias, as it performed the first ever military parade on January 23, 1899, the day of the formal establishment of the First Philippine Republic in what is now the city of Malolos in Bulacan province. \nToday's military parade tradition are also combined with the latter influences of the United States Armed Forces, the Philippine Constabulary and the locally-raised Philippine Scouts, which held parades together with the collegiate formations of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (raised 1912), and later on with Japanese influences during the brief Japanese occupation during the Second World War, where parades were held by servicemen of the both Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy, which high stepped before dignitaries. During the inauguration of the Second Republic on October 14, 1943, Japanese-sponsored military formations marched past in what is now Manila's National Museum Building. On July 4, 1946, the day national independence was restored as a result of the promulgation of the Treaty of Manila, the first modern military parade was held involving both US and Philippine units in historic Rizal Park in Manila, and from then on military parades of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (composed of active and reserve servicemen and women and its veterans), the Philippine National Police, successor to the traditions and history of both the Constabulary and the Integrated National Police (established 1975) and the paramilitary Philippine Coast Guard under the Department of Transportation (established in its modern form in 1967 with roots dating back to 1901 and has been a separate organization since 1998), alongside the college and university ROTC units and other components of the National Service Training Program and the secondary school cadets in Citizen's Army Training (CAT) units from both public and private institutions, are a part of national life and a big staple during major national holidays. These events are expressions of national pride and gratitude for services for the country by servicemen and women of these organizations and a demonstration of their importance to national defense and security. On July 7, 1974, the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas opened its doors with a grand civil-military parade entitled \"Kasaysayan ng Lahi\" (History of the Race) in time for Miss Universe 1974, which also featured formations in historical uniforms from the pre-Spanish era up to the Second World War as well as living veterans of the latter conflict. Until 1962, parades were held on July 4, the former date of Independence Day, and the last Rizal Day parade in honor of the presidential inauguration was held in 1969. Today military parades in the Philippines, which are sometimes also televised events, are held on a number of days (local commemorations indicated in parenthesis):\n\nJanuary 23, First Republic Day (local commemoration)\nJanuary 29, National Police Day\nMarch 23, Army Day\nApril 9, Bataan Day\nMay 20, Navy Day\nMay 28, Flag Day\nJune 12, Independence Day\nJuly 1, Air Force Day\nAugust 18, Police Service Day\nOctober 17, Coast Guard Day\nDecember 21, Armed Forces Day\nOn anniversaries of important battles fought by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, including the following days:\nFebruary 9, Mandaluyong Liberation and Cityhood Day (local commemoration)\nMarch 3, Victory Day in the Battle of Manila (local commemoration)\nMarch 18, Panay Liberation Day (local commemoration)\nMarch 26, Talisay Landing Day (local commemoration)\nAugust 30, Battle of Pinaglabanan Day (local commemoration)\nSeptember 2, Victory over Japan Day (local commemoration)\nSeptember 12, Battle of Pulang Lupa Day (local commemoration)\nOctober 20, Leyte Landing Day (local commemoration)\nNovember 5, Al Cinco de Noviembre (local commemoration)\nDuring a change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet graduation parades within the service branches of the armed forces, the Philippine Military Academy and all officer candidate schools\nDuring holidays and festivals marked by each of the provinces, cities and towns\nOn June 30, the date of the Philippine presidential inauguration\nDuring inauguration ceremonies of provincial governors and city and municipal chief executivesParades in Metro Manila are held principally in the parade grounds of Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City and Quirino Grandstand in Manila with the Philippine Army headquarters in Taguig City and Villamor Air Base in Pasay as secondary venues. Parades are also held in the grounds of Clark Air Base in Pampanga. Regionally, the Bicol Region Military Parade held every second Friday of September in Naga City, Camarines Sur, with over 74,000 youth cadets and athletes from high schools and universities, together with the Armed Forces, National Police and the Bureau of Fire Protection, all taking part, is the country's biggest parade held in honor of the festivties of Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia, and is also the longest and with such big numbers of people marching this civil-military parade is one of the largest ever to be annually held in Southeast Asia. Parades are also held in major cities in the regions during national and regional holidays.\nAlongside the AFP, PNP and PCG, all ROTC units and CAT units in secondary schools (with occasional participation of athletes), also taking part in these parade are:\n\nBureau of Jail Management and Penology\nBureau of Fire Protection\nBoy Scouts of the Philippines\nGirl Scouts of the Philippines\nMilitary veterans\nLaw enforcement and emergency veterans\n\n\n==== Poland ====\n\nThe Polish Armed Forces and the Police of Poland holds two yearly military parades (Polish: Defilada wojskowa) in the capital of Warsaw: The Armed Forces Day parade through Ujazd\u00f3w Avenue and the National Independence Day parade near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Pi\u0142sudski Square. Both of these parades include NATO personnel stationed near or inside the country. The Armed Forces Day Parade was introduced in 2007 and 2008 as first grand military parades since the holiday was reinstated and have been held yearly since 2013. The first Polish military parade took place on 17 January 1945. Prior to 1989, parades were held in front of the Palace of Culture and Science on Parade Square on 22 July commemorate the National Day of the Rebirth of Poland celebrations, honoring the anniversary of the signing of the Stalin-sponsored PKWN Manifesto. Back then, the People's Republic of Poland used many Russian traditions in regard to military parades, especially the inspection by the Minister of Defence. In 1966, during the millennium celebrations of the Christianization of Poland, a parade was held on 22 July which included cadets of military academies and personnel of Polish ceremonial units dressed in historical military uniforms dating back to the Piast dynasty. A special parade was held on 9 May 1985 to honor the 40th anniversary of the Victory in Europe and the servicemen of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the East. In 2019, a 3rd was added when the yearly 3 May Constitution Day parades, last held in 1939 and were held off and on since 1990, were officially reinstated.\nParades are held by these two organizations in major cities and provincial capitals.\nAlongside these two organizations and their veterans the following also take part:\n\nBorder Guards\nPrisons Service\nState Fire Service\nCustoms Service of the National Revenue Administration\nPolish Scouting and Guiding Association\nMarshal's Guard of the Sejm (in Warsaw only)\n\n\n==== Russia and ex-Soviet countries ====\n\nThe Western tradition of military parades in the Russian Empire was part of the many reforms made by Peter the Great as part of his many efforts to transform the army and the navy from traditional militias to a full-blown professional armed service that is a model for the people in discipline and obedience, courage, bravery, loyalty to the country and in bringing pride and glory to her people. During the Imperial period, national parades were alternated between Moscow and Saint Petersburg on major national civil and military holidays, anniversaries of the Romanov Dynasty and as part of the imperial coronation celebrations, celebrations and parades were also held in many major cities and provincial capitals.\nSo important was the value of these parades that even the Soviet Armed Forces made these parades a common tradition beginning in August 1918 when the first modern parade was held in Moscow's Red Square when Moscow area Vsevobuch detachments march past, earlier than May, a military parade, the first by the nascent Red Army, was held outside the capital. Since that year, many innovations have been seen in the practice of annual parades held not just there but in the capital cities of the former Soviet Union, as well as in major cities in the wide country, which were held on 1 May (1918-1941 and 1945-1968), 7 November (1920-1941 and 1945-1990) and 9 May (1945, 1965, 1985 and 1990). The following areas in the union republics were where common parades were held in 1990:\n\n Ukrainian SSR - Khreshchatyk, Kiev\n Byelorussian SSR - Lenin Square, Minsk\n Uzbek SSR - Lenin Square, Tashkent\n Kazakh SSR - Brezhnev Square, Almaty\n Georgian SSR - Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi\n Azerbaijan SSR - Lenin Square, Baku\n Lithuanian SSR - Gediminas Avenue, Vilnius\n Moldavian SSR - Victory Square, Kishinev\n Latvian SSR - 11 November Embankment, Riga\n Kirghiz SSR - Lenin Square, Frunze\n Tajik SSR - Lenin Square, Dushanbe\n Armenian SSR - Lenin Square, Yerevan\n Turkmen SSR - Makhtumkuli Avenue, Ashgabat\n Estonian SSR - Victory Square, TallinnToday, the Russian Armed Forces - and by extension countries of the former Soviet Union - host a variety of military parades held on important national holidays, honoring the men and women of their armed forces and military veterans. The celebrations in each of these countries carry on years of tradition, honor, discipline, and prestige by the millions of men and women who serve and have served in the ranks of the armed forces of their respective home countries. These parades have extensive government funding and aside from the iconic wide march past columns and occasional historical formations, typically include a mobile column, and occasionally a naval fleet review and/or air force fly past segment, a legacy of the Soviet era. Alongside the armed forces and occasionally youth cadets of military high schools, law enforcement and emergency services also take part in the parades in their countries.\n\n\n===== Armenia =====\nWhile the country was a Soviet Republic from 1920 to 1991, Armenia was formerly independent from 1918 to 1920 and thus had armed forces composed of both veterans of the Imperial Army and guerillas fighting the Ottoman armed forces who had been enforcing the anti-Armenian massacres of 1914. Armenians fought bravery in the Eastern Front of the Second World War as part of the Soviet Armed Forces, retaining some of its traditions today. The last of the Soviet-era parades took place in 1988. Today, the Armed Forces of Armenia hosts massive parades held in Yerevan, the capital city, on the following days:\n\nMay 28 - Republic Day\nSeptember 21 - Independence DayIn recent years, national military parades have included drill units and military bands performing exhibition drill for the guests before the parade concludes.\nArmenian military parades have garnered notable controversy. The 1996 parade coincided with the presidential election, which would take place the day after, which resulted in many opposition figures charging President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who was in attendance, with putting on a show of force to his opposition and particularly supporters of his opponent Vazgen Manukyan. Another controversial aspect was censorship, an example of this being in 1994, when Ruben Satyan (editor-in-chief of the Russian language newspaper Vremya) reported that one Armenian general was wearing non-regulation trousers with sewn red stripes on pants intended for a private, a report which resulted in Satyan being summoned to the local military prosecutor's office, who warned him to never do a report like this again, particularly saying that \"It\u2019s good you\u2019re not 45, otherwise, I\u2019d have you sent to fight in Karabakh\".\n\n\n===== Azerbaijan =====\n\nThe semi-annual parade on the Day of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan, 26 June, is one of the biggest in the Commonwealth of Independent States, held every 3 to 5 years at the Azadliq Square, Baku, honoring the many Azerbaijanis who served faithful under the colours as part of her armed forces. The forces on parade are assembled based on a mix of the Turkish and Russian parade formation.\n\n\n===== Belarus =====\n\nThe first venue for the parades in the capital was Cathedral Square. Military parades and solemn processions took place here even before the October Revolution. Upon the Liberation of Minsk in 1944, a parade now known as the Partisans Parade was held. Military parades in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic took place on October Square from 1946 to 1984. \nThe Armed Forces of Belarus holds an annual military parade on 3 July along the Victors Avenue in the national capital Minsk, marking the anniversary of the liberation of the country during the 1944 Minsk Offensive, which coincides with the country's Independence Day. On special years of the victory in Europe, commemorative extraordinary parades are held there on 9 May to honor the millions of Belarusian military dead of the Second World War. Military parades in the country are based on the Russian/Polish model and tradition. Formerly, parades in the Republic of Belarus and the BSSR took place on Independence Square (known in the Soviet era as Lenin Square). This changed in the early 2000s when the square was renovated and became incompatible with the parade format. Since 2004, military parades in the capital have taken place on Victors Avenue.The first military parade in the Western city of Grodno was held 2015 on Lenin Square. In connection with the centennial of the Belarusian Armed Forces in 2018, a military parade was also held in Grodno.\n\n\n===== Estonia =====\nWhile being formerly independent from 1918 to 1940 and as a component republic of the Soviet Union from that year to 1941 and yet again from 1944 to 1991, the current Estonian Defence Forces and the Estonian Defence League, successor to both the military and reserve forces of the First Republic and republican formations under the Baltic Military District and Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Armed Forces, marches during a combination of Russian, Finnish and Western drill in parades held in the following days:\n\nFebruary 24 - Independence Day\nJune 24 - Victory DayDuring the 2006 Victory Day Parade in Saaremaa, the first-ever Fleet Review of the Estonian Navy in Estonian history was conducted by the Estonian Defence League. The Soviet era Estonian language term for the annual parade on what was formerly Victory Square during the 7 November holiday was the Oktoobriparaad (\"October Parade\").\n\n\n===== Georgia =====\nThe Defense Forces of Georgia, successor to the armed services of the Democratic Republic and Soviet formations stationed in the Georgian SSR, hosts military parades on May 26, Independence Day, the anniversary of the formation of the republic in 1918, together with elements from the National Police, the Border Police and the Georgian Coast Guard. The first parade was held on Independence Day in 1991, with 10,000 soldiers of the National Guard of Georgia taking their oath of service in front of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia at Boris Paichadze Stadium. The parade was held without heavy equipment (by order of parade commander, Colonel Avtandil Tskitishvili), with only a small detachment of cavalry being brought to the stadium. Another parade was organized in 1993. From 1997-2004, no military parades had been organized by the government, citing financial difficulties. In 2004, President Mikheil Saakashvili restored the tradition of holding military parades. National independence parades have also been held in the cities of Batumi and Kutaisi.\nModern parades are a mix of the former Soviet and modern Western (British, US, Turkish and Israeli) traditions and drill owing to the modernization of the defense and public security forces to NATO and EU standards.\n\n\n===== Kazakhstan =====\nThe Armed Forces of Kazakhstan holds military parades (Kazakh: \u04d8\u0441\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434) that resemble the parades of the Russian military in Moscow, with one of the only exceptions being the inspection of the troops by the Supreme Commander of the Kazakh Armed Forces, instead of the defense minister. It has never held yearly parades celebrating one occasion, with parades currently being held in honor of the Defender of the Fatherland Day holiday, the first of which being 2014 and the largest parade in existence being held on this date in 2015. In the past, large scale military parades in the former capital of Almaty and the current capital of Nur-Sultan were held on the following holidays:\n\nKazakhstan Independence Day (1996)\nVictory Day (9 May) (1995, 2000, 2005)\nConstitution Day (Kazakhstan) (2009, 2010, 2011)In recent years, the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade was expanded to function as a so-called \"Battle Parade\" (\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434). So far, only two of these kinds of parades have been held; in 2013 and 2018. In contrast to usual military parades, the battle parade includes tactical exercises and military demonstrations. These parades usually are held at the 40th Otar Military Base in the Korday District and take place with the troops in full combat gear rather than a ceremonial full dress uniform. Like former Soviet republics, Kazakh military parades are led by a cadet drum corps, specifically from the Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School.\nAs of 2020, the MC for parade ceremonies is Azamat Kanapiya, who announces the parade live and not pre-recorded like his Russian counterparts.\n\n\n===== Kyrgyzstan =====\nKyrgyz military parades are based on Russian traditions, having been held on many occasions in the history of the Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan. Currently, the only consistent military parade is held on Ala-Too Square in Bishkek every 5 years in honor of the country's Independence Day. Other military parades have been held celebrating different occasions. On 24 March 2006, a parade was held on the same square celebrating the 1 year anniversary since the Tulip Revolution which overthrew President Askar Akayev. In May of that same year, a Day of the Armed Forces parade on the same square, later being deemed as \"irresponsible\" by opposition lawmaker Omurbek Tekebaev due to the fact that it coincided with opposition protests against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, which itself was described by Defence Minister Ismail Isakov as purely \"coincidental\". In 2015, a Victory Day Parade was held in the Kyrgyz capital, being presided by Prime Minister Temir Sariyev and Chief of General Staff Asanbek Alymkozhoev in place of President Almazbek Atambayev, who was attending the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade that same day. The parade saw the appearance of veterans of the war in the mobile column as well as Russian troops from the local Kant Air Base taking part in the parade.\n\n\n===== Latvia =====\nLatvia, like its neighbors to the north and south, was also formerly independent from 1918 to 1940 and as a component republic of the Soviet Union from that year to 1941 and yet again from 1944 to 1991, and its armed forces, then as in the 90s, were formed up of Latvian born personnel who served in the Russian military and thus share some of the Russian drill and parade ceremonial in combination with Western practices. After the restoration of Latvia's independence, parades at the Freedom Monument began on 23 August 1992. Today, the Latvian National Armed Forces hosts massive parades (with occasional participation by service personnel of NATO armed forces) on the following dates:\n\nMay 4, Restoration of Independence Day\nNovember 11, L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis Day\nNovember 18, Proclamation Day of the Republic of Latvia\n\n\n===== Lithuania =====\nThe first official military parade in Lithuania took place on 11 May 1919 in Kaunas. In the latter years of Soviet rule, military parades were met with much hostility. In 1989, protesters in Vilnius blocked tanks rolling on the central avenue and a year later, Chairman of the Supreme Council Vytautas Landsbergis and Prime Minister Kazimira Prunskien\u0117 both condemned the holding of a Soviet parade as \"psychological warfare\" and an attempt by the Soviet authorities to \"intimidate\" then breakaway republic.An annual parade is held on Lithuanian Armed Forces Day (celebrated on 23 November). The holiday is traditionally celebrated with a noon parade reviewed by the President of Lithuania on Cathedral Square in Vilnius, which runs through Gediminas Avenue to Independence Square. NATO, alongside Lithuanian troops take part in the parade. In recent years large parades were held on the 95th anniversary and centennial (in 2013 and 2018) of the restoration of the Lithuanian military. Another large parade was held in 2004 on the occasion of the nation joining NATO.\n\n\n===== Russia =====\nMilitary parades in Russia were first held in 1702 as a troop review, but later grew into a ceremonial event held by order of the President of the Russian Federation in his constitutional duty as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Alongside personnel and veterans of the Armed Forces, marching past in these parades are cadets of military high schools and middle schools and the Young Army Cadets National Movement, cadets of military faculties of civil universities and battalions of Cossacks, honoring their forebears who fought for their homeland in times past. Also, the following uniformed organizations take part in these parades:\n\nKremlin Regiment of the Federal Protective Service (in Moscow only)\nNational Guard of Russia\nPolice of Russia\nMain Directorate for Drugs Control\nBorder Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation\nMinistry of Emergency Situations\nFederal Penitentiary Service\nInvestigative Committee of RussiaToday, the Moscow Victory Day Parade is the main national parade in the country, which follows the traditional format of the now defunct October Revolution Day Parades and the International Workers Day Parade. In Russia, military parades are annually held in many parts of the country on the following days:\n\nDefender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February\nVictory Day on 9 May - Victory Day marks Germany's surrender to the Soviet Union in 1945 and is Russia's foremost national military holiday since 1995\nNavy Day on the last Sunday of JulyTwo of the most significant military parades on Moscow's Red Square were 1941 October Revolution Parade and the Victory Parade in 1945. Individual parades on the square were held on 7 March 1919 and 27 July 1920 in honor of World Congresses of the Communist International, on 7 February 1934 in honor of the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), on the very first Day of Tankmen in 1946 and one following the state funeral of Joseph Stalin in March 1953. Today, the square serves as the foremost parade venue in the nation. Rehearsals for these parades took place at Khodynka Aerodrome and Vnukovo Airfield in the Soviet era and the Alabino in the modern era.The following Days of Military Honour often see parades held in individual cities:\n\n27 January \u2013 Day of lifting of the Siege of Leningrad (held on Palace Square in Saint Petersburg)\n2 February \u2013 Victory Day in the Battle of Stalingrad (held on Fallen Fighters Square in Volgograd)\n23 August \u2013 Victory Day over Germany in the Battle of Kursk (held on Square of Heroes of the Battle of Kursk in Kursk)\n2 September - Victory over Japan Day (held in the cities of the Eastern Military District such as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk or Khabarovsk)\n7 November \u2013 Anniversary of the historic 1941 military parades on the Red Square in Moscow and Kuybyshev Square in Samara (held every year on both squares)\n\n\n===== Tajikistan =====\n\nTajik military parades are held every 2 to 3 years on Dushanbe's Dousti Square. They are either held on the occasion of Independence Day or Armed Forces Day. They usually feature the entire Dushanbe Garrison and its hardware. The first parade in Dushanbe, which was at the time known as Stalinabad, took place on an area known as Red Square on 7 November 1945. Since then, Soviet military parades of the 201st Motor Rifle Division in the Tajikistan SSR have been held on 9 May and 7 November in Lenin Square annually until 1990. The first military parade in the Republic of Tajikistan was held on armed forces day in 1993.\n\n\n===== Turkmenistan =====\nThe principal parade hosted by the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan is held during the annual Independence Day Parade in Independence Square in Ashgabat every September 27, Independence Day, marking the day of the declaration of Turkmen independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. (From 1992 to 2017 the parade was held on October 27, the day of the independence plebiscite.) Parades have also been held on Day of Neutrality. In 2020, the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War II was celebrated with a military parade for the first time at the square in front of the Halk Hakydasy Memorial Complex.\n\n\n===== Ukraine =====\nUkrainian parades involve the active and reserve men and women and veterans of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It holds parades on the following:\n\nSecond Sunday of July - Navy Day\nMay 9 - Victory Day over Nazism in World War II\nAugust 24 - Ukrainian Independence Day\nOctober 13 - Defender of Ukraine DaySomething that distinguishes Ukrainian military parades from its other post-Soviet counterparts is, during the Kiev parade, the marchpast of the tri-service Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion with the Flag of Ukraine to raise at the flagpole while honors are rendered, which includes the playing of Shche ne vmerla Ukraina. Since 2014, military bands have also played an integral part in these parades by marching with their units as part of the parade. Unlike their other counterparts, who use Hello Comrades as the official greeting during parades, Ukraine uses Glory to Ukraine as the official holiday greeting, with the troops responding by saying Glory to the Heroes.The first major parade was held on 9 May 1995, with the participation of over 75 veterans from Ukraine and the CIS. The voice of military parades in Ukraine is Dmitry Khorkin, who since 2011 has been the official master of ceremonies for the national parades held in Kiev's Independence Square. Khorkin's voice became remarkable for official events with the participation of the country's top officials and for supporting the Ukrainian army, that's why he had received threats from pro-Russian separatists before the 2016 military parade.Other cities hold parades on the following days:\n\nKharkiv: Day of the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation (parades held in 1993, 2003)In addition to the Armed Forces the following organizations also take part:\n\nNational Guard of Ukraine\nSecurity Service of Ukraine\nNational Police of Ukraine\nState Border Guard Service of Ukraine\nState Emergency Service of Ukraine\n\n\n==== Serbia/Former Yugoslavia ====\nMilitary parades in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia follow a close tradition that is significantly unique to the Balkan states. Their usage of the high step instead of the more European goose step is a notable display of heritage and tradition in their parades. The Yugoslav People's Army held its first military parade on Bulevar revolucije just days before the conclusion of the Second World War on International Workers Day. Another parade on 20 October of that same year was held in honor of the one year anniversary of the end of the Belgrade Offensive.Since then military parades in the SFRY were held on the following dates and occasions:\n\n1 May 1946\n19 October 1946\n1 May 1947\n1 May 1948\n1 May 1949\n1 May 1950\n1 May 1951\n1 May 1952\n1 May 1953\n1 May 1954\n1 May 1955\n1 May 1956\n1 May 1957\n1 May 1960\n1 May 1961\n1 May 1962\n1 May 1963\n1 May 1964\n9 May 1965\n9 May 1970\n9 May 1975 \u2013 It was the first parade to feature the high-stepping march style, which was instituted by Marshal Josip Broz Tito to assert his independence from Soviet influence.\n9 May 1985 \u2013 The parade (branded as Parade 85) was the last victory parade before the brake up of Yugoslavia in the early 90s. It was also significant as it was the first parade that was not presided by Marshal Tito as leader of Yugoslavia.Outside of the Serbian Armed Forces, the Army of the Republic of North Macedonia, the Armed Forces of Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina still use the Serbian/Yugoslav parade format, as shown below.\n\n\n===== Croatia =====\nThe first Croatian military parade took place in the neighborhood of Jarun on 30 May 1995, marking Croatian Statehood Day. Another parade was held on the same date in 1997.\nA special military parade of the Republic of Croatia Armed Forces in honor of Victory Day was held on 4 August 2015 in Zagreb, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Operation Storm. Lijepa na\u0161a domovino (the national anthem) was notably performed by 12-year old Mia Negoveti\u0107, accompanied by the Croatian Armed Forces Band and the Croatian Navy's vocal ensemble. The editorial board of the Zagreb based Jutarnji list gave a positive review of the event and called for the introduction of regular parades on 4 August, whereas military analyst Igor Tabak criticized the inauthenticity of many \"historical units\".\n\n\n===== North Macedonia =====\nOn Army Day in 2012, a parade at Ilinden Barracks in Skopje was held on the jubilee of the 20th anniversary of the Army of North Macedonia led by the Chief of the General Staff, Major General Gorancho Koteski.\n\n\n===== Serbia =====\n\nThe first massive parade in the Republic of Serbia took place on Liberation Day on 16 October 2014. Known commonly as the March of the Victor, the parade took place on Nikola Tesla Boulevard and included 4,500 Serbian Army troops, the Russian Swifts aerobatic team and even an appearance by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the guest of honour. Similar parades are still held annually. On 10 May 2019, the first Victory Day Parade in close to 35 years was held in the city of Ni\u0161. Branded as the \"Defence of Freedom\" show, the parade also included personnel of the Police of Serbia, which also marked the 20th anniversary of the Yugoslav resistance to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n==== South Africa ====\nThe tradition of military parades in South Africa traces its origin to the Netherlands, thru the Dutch East India Company, and later on the United Kingdom. The combination of traditions from these two countries created a unique South African tradition that would be manifested in the public parades of today's South African National Defence Force, created 1912 on the basis of the former separate regional armed forces of the country and has been in its current form since 1994, infusing traditions from the armed forces of the former Bantustans and the guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa until the 1990s.\nToday, the parade held on Armed Forces Day held every 21 February serves as the principal military parade of the SANDF. It is a double anniversary of both the 1917 sinking of SS Mendi during the First World War, which became the country's biggest military tragedy in history, and the 1994 reformation of the South Africa Defence Force into the current day SANDF. The national parade is held yearly in a set host city, with the service branches organizing celebrations yearly with a specific branch being tasked for the organization of the national celebrations, with responsibilities being changed year after year. Taking the salute is the President of South Africa, who is commander in chief of the Forces.\n\n\n==== Turkey ====\nThe Turkish tradition of military parades was introduced in the 19th century as part of the Westernization and modernization of the army and navy of the then Ottoman Empire to modern standards of warfare and military ceremonial, a tradition carried on by the modern Turkish Armed Forces, whose parade drill includes high stepping, a tradition introduced in the 1900s.\nToday parades held by the Turkish Armed Forces and its veterans are held in the following days:\n\nApril 23 - National Sovereignty and Children's Day\nMay 19 - Commemoration of Atat\u00fcrk, Youth and Sports Day\nAugust 30 - Victory Day, also principal holiday of the Armed Forces\nOctober 29 - Republic Day\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a guard of honour traditionally performs the march past for whoever received the salute. In the capital of London, traditional ceremonial units that  perform public duties (the Queens Guard for example) take part in military parades such as the more common Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade and special parades during the jubilee years of the monarch in his or her capacity as commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. The Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals and Life Guards) traditionally perform trot pasts in mounted formation, together with the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. These units have been known to parade in slow and quick time. Personnel of the armed forces, cadet organizations, The Royal British Legion and veterans' organizations also parade during national holidays such as Remembrance Day or Armed Forces Day. During a regimental military parade, the regimental march of the unit is played.\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nMilitary parades in the American capital are held quadrennially by servicemen of the United States Armed Forces during the Presidential inaugural parade. These are not considered to be regular military parades however, as the parading formations are actually not entirely composed of armed servicemen. The first known organized military procession in the United States was the Grand Review of the Armies, on May 23 and May 24, 1865, following the end of the American Civil War (1861-1865). The New York City Victory Parade of 1946 was held in mid-January in 1946 to commemorate the conclusion of World War II and the Allied victory over the Axis Powers in all theaters of the war, helped by the service of millions of Americans who served under the armed forces and the National Guard, in addition to the state defense forces. In the late 40s and the early 50s, massive parades in honor of Army Day and later Armed Forces Day were held in the capital. The most recently held military parade was the National Victory Celebration on June 8, 1991, to celebrate the conclusion of Gulf War in Iraq. In 2018, a national debate was sparked when President Donald Trump proposed to hold a military parade on 10 November 2018 in honor of the Veterans Day holiday the next day, commonly known as the \"Trump Military Parade\". This was seen as expensive and authoritarian-like and by August of that year, the Department of Defense announced that the military parade would be postponed until 2019. The 2019 Fourth of July parade was the first attended by the President of the United States in his capacity as the constitutional commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and the National Guard Bureau, with the parade route was changed to include the Lincoln Memorial complex within the greater area around the National Mall. It was also the first time since the 1950s where units aside from the guards of honor, also included cadets from the military academies, units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard and the nationally produced military equipment of the services marching past in the national capital city in front of the members of government, Congress, veterans and the people of the capital.\nAnnual military parades, as well as armed forces and veterans' participation in civil parades are held in the following days in major cities in the country, in areas with military installations and in state capitals:\n\nMarch 29: Vietnam Veterans Day\n3rd Saturday of May: Armed Forces Day\nLast Monday of May: Memorial Day\n14 June: Flag Day and Army Birthday\n4 July -

          "One of those almost compulsory visits in any DPRK tour itinerary so it's just a matter of going thru the motions and putting up with the distorted view of the world being pushed by the guides. It's interesting just to hear what they say and see what's on display without any need",

          "Anyone who spends more than two days in North Korea will undoubtedly pass through this museum; I was led here by my guides the morning of my second full day in the country. Docent-led tours are mandatory, although only a single other tourist joined my group. The complex is",

          "Very impressed. They did an excellent job on this museum. It would rival any war museum that I have visited anywhere in the world. We only had a couple of hours but could have spent the entire day. It of course presents the history of the war from the view of the DPRK. It is",
          "an impressive museum - huge and we only saw a portion of it, Some really well presented exhibits - but others quite ghoulish. The Guide had been well schooled in what to say and didn't deviate at all from an obviously well memorised script. Propaganda a its best - but still well",
          "While you'll be subjected to propaganda during your entire stay in North Korea, the War Museum is one of the places where they lay it on thickest. You start outside, where they show you the trophies they collected in the war: American tanks and helicopters, with photos of the",

          "Really disappointed in this museum because after looking closely it was clear that it was all fake. Basically the history is twisted to make it look glorious, when really it is based on hyped up propaganda. The North Korean authorities should be ashamed of his farce of a museum,",

          "I am a a huge nerd when it comes to wars and museum regarding this matter. Until I came to Pyongyang my favourite war related museum was the Imperial War Museum in London. The museum tour starts with the USS Pueblo and some movies regarding it. Outside the museum they show you",
          "The new part of the museum was opened in 2013 as a part of the 60-years celebration that DPRK won the war (!). The tour started with a female military guide telling about the Korean war. The story the guide told me was not like the one I learnt at school, but I did not question",
          "Visited this museum twice during two separate tours. A local guide, usually a female in uniform will lead the tour. The newly renovated museum is huge and the interior is opulent. A huge coloured statue of Kim II Sung greets you on top of huge marble stairs. One can see that a",
          "Traveling to Pyongyang to run the 2016 Pyongyang Marathon, I had the opportunity to visit the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum. Significant exhibits include the Battle of Daejon, and the USS Pueblo, the US Navy ship that was captured by North Korean forces in 1968.",
          "We arrived a bit late so were the last group to go through that day. You start with the war trophies of captured Imperialist weapons & shot down aircraft. You then get to see their pride & joy the captured USS Pueblo. You get to watch a victory movie (15min) before you move on",
          "As a veteran and former combat pilot, this was a tough pill to swallow. Severe graphic pictures of dead US servicemen, and over the top propaganda, even by North Korean standards. Getting to see and walk through THE USS Pueblo, was worth the future mental scars. The museum is",
          "...but if you're looking for an ACCURATE representation of history, look elsewhere. It was so twisted that it was hard to keep a straight face during the guide's explanation. LOL",
          "When we arrived it was something like 6 PM and dark. It looked like it the museum was especially open for us. The exhibition is a full treasure. But unfortuanately, the museum guide rushed the visit and the explanations. So, we could see maybe only 50% of it. Also, there is a",
          "I thought I had studied my far eastern history, well I was wrong. Worth a visit just to have a unique history lesson",
          "The museum is amazing, we were there for a couple of hours but only scratched the surface of what they have to offer. It is a lot of saying \"who started the war\" but besides that it does give you a look at their perspective and outlook on the war and how it still effects them",
          "Huge place full of the DPRK view of the Korean war. Very interesting and full of a perspective you won't hear outside the country. I was stunned by the grandeur of the place - possibly the most ostentatious museum I've visited.",
          "We got here quite late in the day and received a personalised tour through the museum by a tiny lady in full military uniform, her (obviously research speech) about the aggressive oppressors didn't match her look. Loved the video \"Who started the Korean war?\". The museum is",
          "This is a very large museum on which a vast sum of money must have been spent building it. On display outside a large numbers of Korean War relics that once belonged to the \"aggressive Americans\".",
          "The museum provided an interesting insight into the north Korean version of history. With amazingly manicured gardens to well maintained relics, this place is certainly worth a visit when in Pyongyang. The guides here had an excellent command of English and comms were made easy",
          "Yes, this is all about the greatness of the DPRK and how terrible Americans are. But the exhibits are very well designed and the whole experience is fascinating.",
          "Definitely ask your guides to put this on your itinerary when in DPRK (most do as standard but check). The site itself is vast and houses many captured military vehicles and artefacts which the museum guides will explain with immense pride. You need an open mind for this and",
          "This is a huge museum with lots of displays to explore. Huge statues of soldiers in various poses and vehicle remnants of the Korean War greet you at the outside entrance. The U.S.S. Pueblo is on a dock right besides the museum. The guide (dressed in military uniform) will tell",
          "Just like Mansudae Grand Monument, this place is a must for all tourist that wish to visit North Korea",
          "You must come here. The building its self is a work of art Just keep your mind open and your mouth shut. In some points it's very confronting and the point of view presented will challenge you, but just keep you mind open and take it all in",
          "Impressive museum, with a rather different perspective of the Korean war to the one we might be used to. The outside area has DPRK equipment on one side and captured/shot down equipment on the other. Inside there was a huge amount of material, beautifully presented, with a 360",
          "The museum is the usual mix of DRPK propaganda and selective history and is compulsory. At least you don't have to look at everything and the Pueblo was interesting.",
          "A must-visit to hear the North Korean's version of the liberation war and the Korean war. Photography is allowed outside but not inside of the museum. Included the USS Pueblo, docked along the river next to the museum, which had been captured from the US. Impressive exhibits.",
          "The museum decor is like a five star hotel and the displays include the captured US spy vessel. There is little recognition of the key role that China played in the Korean War. Worth a visit.",
          "Hard to explain how impressive this place is, both outside and inside. It would probably take more than a day to visit entirely. Very well done exhibitions, although it fails to mention the massive help they received from China, which certainly played a key role in the final",
          "A very important and historical place for all visitor's to see. Lots of interesting details and very well organised. Good staff and with knowledge and information. Strongly recommend.",
          "I've never seen a War Museum quite as grand as this one! The statue of Kim Il Sung as you enter is impressive but just so over the top. I have never seen anything quite like it. It is absolutely fascinating to learn about the war from the North Korean perspective. There were",
          "It's one of the very best museums you can visit. There's taken care of all details. It takes at least an hour.",
          "Beautiful/spotless museum & grounds.. Loud emotional music deliberately played whilst being shown propaganda of painted paintings of American war crimes.. Time & time the guide/guard will ask you \"If this is upsetting, please sit outside\", almost willing you into a state of",
          "I wish we'd been able to spend an entire afternoon here, as there were plenty of rooms we only passed by. The dioramas of the anguished Americans were fascinating, and the entire perspective and focus of the museum emphasised how much the Korean War and its aftermath dominate",
          "Pyongyang is a city like no other, This 100 million dollar museum built by the great leader in the showcase capital just shows how much money the Pyongyang elite are willing to spend to protect and \"educate\" others of the war they supposedly won. Go into this willing to be told",
          "One of the most beautiful museums I have ever been to. If you did not read about the Korean war before the visit you will after. It is fantastic and scary at the same time how a regime can change the history and present it in a believable way. No sign of Chinese / Russian",
          "This place was amazing, I really hope you get to visit it as part of your tour. Highlights: - The USS Pueblo, including photos of the soldiers they were very proud to have killed, and lots of talk about how 'The US Imperialists' are idiots who they bested. - The hanger filled",
          "Do your homework concerning the Korean War before you go. Once there be prepared to hear and see a completely alternate reality presented to you. A reality so completely divorced from what anyone else in the world thinks or has studied. This is where Orwellian mindset becomes",
          "Our guide told us that it would take her four days to take us through the museum. It is huge. Elaborate. The statutes of Kim Il Sung and son when you enter will blow you away. Unfortunately, no pictures inside. Only go if you do not get phased by seeing lots graphic",
          "Yeah, you get to hear their side of the story for the Korean war. Yeah, Americans are bad guys, and they are one big family with South Korea. Just, try not to laugh.",
          "While you may not agree with everything in this museum it is a masterful example of the regime and the new museum building is definitely worthwhile seeing.",
          "Another Kim Family Relic. All devoted to the dead president for life, Kim Il Sung. Also another place where I was completely alone surrounded by armed \"guides\". Extremely interesting if you are in to The Kim Family and their unbelieavble history.",
          "One of the more impressive places during my visit. You will hear a different view on historical facts. Up to you if you accept it or not.",
          "You've heard the American side of the story before to get here in the first place so It's only fair to get a detailed view from this side too... Very interesting!! Fiction or facts.. What you take home is up to ur understanding of where this country comes from... What the people",
          "This is so one-sided if you are an American you might rage against this. We are (of course) in a group tour led by one of their soldiers and she only showed us to the right side of the entrance where they kept the American planes, helicopters, bombs, gums, tanks that were being",
          "Washington might not have a museum as grand as this Great from the outside Many exhibits and battle scene recreation Highly recommended Guide was very cute too",
          "The guides explain the history of the war from the prospective of the DPRK. Various massive rooms had dioramas, tanks, planes and much more.",
          "The first thing that strikes you is the number of brides going to be photographed there. Then it's the vast spaces that have to be traversed, both outside and in, like all PDRK attractions, it has vast corridors and much bowing to statues. It is a very interesting, if one sided",
          "A very interesting museum but understand that the North Korean version of history is fanciful to say the least.",
          "If you want the other guys point of view this is where to go, heavy on the propaganda, whether justified or not, this museum has a collection of captured (or found) American hardware that the Smithsonian would envy. our guide was excellent, but the Americans in our group did get",
          "Like all landmarks in Pyongyang, this is an imposing and incredible place. Naturally it is very anti-American and they make a big deal of the equipment captures from the US forces, especially the USS Pueblo moored outside the museum. The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War",
          "Some nice propaganda is included, which makes this a museum that you will remember. My advice is to read up on everything you hear after (or prior to) your visit, when you're in the free world again.",
          "North Koreans call the 50s' Korean War the \"Victorious Fatherland Liberation War\" while for the rest of the world is known as \"the forgotten war\". History tells us that this war began with Kim Il Sung army stiking against South Korea in June 1950 but in this Museum your guide",
          "great museum and it also hosts the USS Pueblo (AGER-2) the captured USA spy ship, it also has some Korean and USA vehicles and planes. The small statues are pretty cool and the main statue is very impressive in my opinion one of the best communist style statues ive seen. The",
          "My son and I visited this museum as part of our tour itinerary. We were looking forward to it, as there were very good reviews, and it did not disappoint. The tour started with a walk through the \"artillery section\" in front of the museum. Korean weapons used were displayed to",
          "Propaganda in its most obvious form, but excellent displays, high variety of objects, with inside and outside building, plus the captured Pueblo ship, which is very interesting",
          "Go with a really open mind. I visited it twice (bec I had to) and there is a lot of history interspersed with the common Korean collective thought.",
          "Did not do a full tour as this was the last place I visited before I had to rush to the airport. Impressive facade and interior - I am really awed by the grandeur of the interior and that huge crystal chandelier above the statue of their leader Kim II-sung. However no",
          "Visiting the museum with a guide gave us a great insight into the DPRK history and especially the War... The museum houses the USS Pueblo as well as weapons from the US military. The exhibit is an impressive shrine to war heroes and leaders.",
          "This is DPRK point of view at its very best. The museum is amazing, a huge amount of money and effort has gone into creating this. You will hear the story of the Korean war from the DPRK point of view and it is so interesting to hear them explain how a \"strategic withdrawal\"",
          "A very modern museum with lots to see, including shot down American aircraft, the USS Pueblo, and various other old artifacts.",
          "The guide was the most pretty gal in the country It tells the history of Korea war from the North Korean prospective",
          "The building is very grand, probably the best bit. Walk around the grounds along riverfront too. The actual exhibitions inside are a bit tacky. The video we watched was very one sided. Some of the imagery and depictions were distasteful.",
          "The building itself is immaculate. After first viewing captured U.S. military equipment from the Korean War, you are lead inside the museum to the grand hall. There is a huge statue of Kim Jong-Un (the current leader), but they will claim it is of Kim Il-Sung in his youth.",
          "SUMMARY: A beautiful campus with new impressive buildings, parks, 60-year-old war machinery, and the USS Pueblo anchored in the river making up one of the boundaries of the compound. A must-see. I wanted to sit on the grass all day just taking in the atmosphere but of course",
          "It is new and an amazing building done in a most spectacular way with the best marble brass glass with world class designs in architecture can wait to see it again",
          "This is a large museum that takes a long time to get around. The first thing you will see are a lot of captured US vehicles, finishing with the captured USS Pueblo which you get to go inside. Afterwards you get to go into the museum itself. The museum is interesting, full of",
          "Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos inside of the museum. Keep in mind that this is the brand new opened museum; seems that the last one was not that good. Have seen many memorial and war museums ( WAW, Johannesburg), but by far this is the most impressive one! The",
          "The building is over impressive for what it contains. The only thing unique or of historical interest is the USS Pueblo (which we didn't get to visit!). The place is just filled up with anything left over from the war. I much preferred the war museum in Dandong especially the",
          "The war museum is really beautiful. Of course, the history is only only under a DPRK perspective but this is expected right? There are 2 big areas outside the museum one with all the equipments captured by the DPRK army and another one with the equipment used by the DPRK army",
          "Very impressive museum showing the events of Korean war from the viewpoint of North Korea. The building and especially the panorama painting on top floor of the building are very spectacular. They also present a huge collection of captured US military equipment. Don't miss that",
          "This was only one of many eye-opening, paradigm-challenging experiences on this trip to Pyongyang and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [aka North Korea]. It's sometimes difficult to see how others experience us, particularly our role in the Korean War. But",
          "This is a spectacular building with impressive monuments and statues in the front square. There is a collection of US military hardware from the Korean war and also the captured spy ship the USS Pueblo. The exhibition itself is huge and the guide tends to rush you through it. I",
          "This is honestly one of the best war museums I have ever visited, I was really impressed with the way it has been done. This was not supposed to feature on our tour, but we got lucky and are so happy that we got to see it. We suggested to our guides that it should be included in",
          "A stunning propaganda piece - it's the best re writing of history I have ever seen ( even better than the Egyptian Army war museum and the narratives of how they won the Six day war). A must visit for all \"spin doctors\"!",
          "Visiting the USS Pueblo is always good. The museum is very new (rebuilt in 2013) and it's quite grand and lavish. The graphics sometimes are not really what a western would expect, but that's in common with Seoul. And the propaganda is amazing. You don't get such propaganda",
          "The best museum I have seen and probably one of the best in the world. The museum is now in its new building (next to the old one) and its truly amazing. As other reviewers have stated, its not possible to take photos inside which is such a shame as its truly stunning. The",
          "Very nice museum which shows all the history of the Koreas since the mess hit the fan years ago. It's the cleanest newest piece of architecture you'll find in Pyonyabg apart from the pyramid-skyscraper.",
          "The museum isn't that bad, really, but you'll have to go there on a guided tour, which will mean you'll spend a long time hearing about things you're probably not that interested in, instead of being allowed to look at the bits that may actually give you something. There's a",
          "OK, first of all lets get one thing straight. This museum tells only one side of the story. Its pure brain washing propaganda. That said, in terms of getting its message across, its one of the best museums I've ever been too. The exhibits (whilst not all in English) are",
          "Once in Pyongyang you'll immediately notice that it is very important for the North Koreans to tell you their side of the story. No photos allowed to be taken inside the museum. A guide is provided to narrate and walk you through the museum and their version of the Korean War.",
          "The North's view of the Korean War. Propaganda is everywhere. You will be shown a video of American atrocities or something like that, a play of something revolutionary and lots of artefacts proving that the Americans were the aggressors. Interesting for someone interested in",
          "another fascinating musuem with captured artifacts and a review of the history of the korean war , some of the english could do with improvement at the museum",
          "yes, we all know its pure propaganda with hardly a shed of truth told within its walls. But some of the exihibits are interesting, at least the captured military equipment from the 1953 korean war. It has been fairly well preserved though I have seen better examples in Japan",
          "This museum exceeded my expectations and was one of the unexpected highlights of my trip to the DPRK. Sure, it presents the history of the Korean War from the very unique perspective of the north, but I was surprised by the quality and craftsmanship of the displays. One of the",
          "I was very much in awe at some of the dramatic scenes depicted in the artwork. I am talking of walking through Universal Studio type displays. The realism of the artwork makes it difficult not to imagine that you are actually in the scene being depicted. It is very well done.",
          "They have just relocated and renovated this museum in 2012. I visited its new site, near the river. This is also a good spot to take photos of the Ryugong hotel also. We were met my a female guide who was a soldier and spoke good English. Outside have many statues displaying",
          "Last summer I, a born and bred American, traveled to North Korea for a week. It was a fascinating trip and all in all, I really enjoyed myself and learned a lot. However, I can see how very many Americans would be EXTREMELY uncomfortable in North Korea and especially in the",
          "You hear those words a lot in North Korea, a country stuck in the Korean war days, but this is where you will hear them most- every other sentence. Our guide asked why we were laughing so much and we told her. She got a little better after that. I particularly noted the diorama",
          "You have to be prepared for this as an American- we are the enemy- that you can accept, but some of the exhibitions are beyond the pale, like a diorama with a full sized dead American soldier with a crow standing on his body, picking at his flesh.",

The monument is rich in symbolism: the hammer, sickle and calligraphy brush symbolize the workers, farmers and intellectuals. The element is 50 meters high to symbolize the 50-year anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. The number of slabs comprising the belt around the monument and its diameter stand for the date of birth of Kim Jong-il. The inscription on the outer belt says \"Long live the leader and organizer of the victories of the people of Korea, the Worker's Party of Korea!\" On the inside of the belt are three bronze reliefs with their distinct meanings: the historical root of the party, the unity of people under the party and the party's vision for a progressive future. Two red flag-shaped buildings with letters forming the words \"ever-victorious\" surround the monument.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monument, designed by Mansudae Art Studio, was completed on 10 October 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers' Party of Korea. A previous monument dedicated to the foundation had been erected on 10 October 1975 on the grounds of the Party Founding Museum.The Monument to Party Founding has appeared on postage stamps in 1995 and 2005 and on the 50 won banknote.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe monument is situated on Munsu Street in the Taedonggang District of Pyongyang. The monument sits on the bank of the Taedong River. Opposite to the other side of the river is the Mansu Hill Grand Monument, and the Korean Revolutionary Museum, both of which the Monument to Party Founding is symmetrically aligned with. This axis across the center of Pyongyang symbolizes the dynasty of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.The monument site in its entirety spans 25,000 square meters. This includes a plaza in front of the monument where dances and festivities are held. The lawn of the park surrounding the monument is 15,000 square meters in extent. There are 12 fountain basins. The grounds are spotted with more than 53,000 trees.There are symmetrical, waving flag-shaped, red residential buildings on either side of the monument. The letters on top of the buildings read: \"ever-victorious\".The monument itself is made of granite and the reliefs are bronze.Three highest element of the monument features three clenched fists holding a hammer, sickle and a calligraphy brush. The hammer and sickle symbolize workers and farmers and the brush intellectuals. The triumvirate is based on the emblem of the Workers' Party of Korea. The monument reaches to a height of 50 meters to signify the 50th anniversary of the party.The architectural style bears resemblance to concrete structures in the city, such as the Pyongyang Ice Rink or the Ryugyong Hotel.\n\n\n=== Belt ===\nThe three fists are surrounded by a belt, symbolizing the \"single-hearted unity of the leader, Party and people\". The inscription on the outer belt reads: \"Long live the leader and organizer of the victories of the people of Korea, the Worker's Party of Korea!\" (Korean: \uc870\uc120\uc778\ubbfc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2b9\ub9ac\uc758 \uc870\uc9c1\uc790\uc774\uba70 \ud5a5\ub3c4\uc790\uc778 \uc870\uc120\ub85c\ub3d9\ub2f9 \ub9cc\uc138!; MR: Chos\u014fninmin\u016di mod\u016dn s\u016dngni\u016di chojikchaimy\u014f hyangdojain chos\u014fllodongdang manse!) The diameter of the belt is 50 meters on the outside and 42 meters on the inside. The belt is made of 216 blocks. The 216 blocks and the 42-meter inner diameter symbolize the date 16 February 1942, the purported date of birth of Kim Jong-il. In reality, he was born on 16 February 1941 in the Soviet Union.The circular foundation under the monument is 70 meters in diameter symbolizing the about 70-year history of the party from the days of the Down-With-Imperialism Union. On the inside of the belt are three reliefs covering the history of the party.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJuche Tower\nArch of Triumph (Pyongyang)\nParty Foundation Day\nHistory of the Workers' Party of Korea\nSocialist realism\nCulture of North Korea\nKorean architecture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nMonument to Party Founding on Flickr\n360-degree panorama\nDocumentary about construction on YouTube (in Korean)\nDocumentary about the monument and Mansu Hill Grand Monument on YouTube (in Korean)",

          "I already been in met moma london museums, louvre etc but this one is amazing. The museum is super new and everything is really well done... You can see a 3d effects and a demonstration of how everything happened at this time... Simulations, panormas etc. Photos not allowed",
          "This museum has recently been rebuilt and I have to admit it\u2019s pretty impressive. Outside you have numerous UN war vehicles that were left behind in Korea after the war. This also includes an American spy ship that the Korean people see as a great victory to have gained. Trust",
          "This was certainly an eye opener and it surpassed all my expectations. Usually I do not like to visit war museums, but this was the BEST EVER. Unfortunately one cannot take any pictures inside the museum, because ALL the exhibitions are fascinating and very realistic. The",
          "When visiting DPRK it's hard to know what to expect, there's not much information out there. Well museum was excellent, newly refurbished with excellent facility's and fascinating exhibitions. The navy ship outside is incredible, the rotating timeline in the roof is amazing too.",
          "You will be taken there and shown the DPRK's view of the war against the Japanese occupation and the US intervention. A highlight is a clamber around the spy ship USS Pueblo. How they got it up the Taedong River from the east coast where it was captured is a mystery. But it",
          "The museum is now housed in a new building which sets off its contents brilliantly. Our guide, a female officer in the DPRK army showed us firstly destroyed American military hardware and then the spy ship US Pueblo (captured in 1968) which was moored nearby. The grounds of the",
          "Glorious places, great architecture, impressive, oh I love it so much, i will go there in every free time, beautiful just like sunshine!",
          "A great museum with the DPRK (North Korean) account of the Korean War. Having read Max Hastings book about the Korean War and having first visited the South, it was interesting to see the DPRK's point of view. There are very interesting captured American hardware including a",
          "This museum is at a level of any museum in Europe; with the exception of few information in English. Nice exhibitions on the different rooms, and a live diorama of a famous battle in NK. On the outside, you can take pictures to the tanks captured by NK. You need 3-4h to fully",
          "Needed more time there, but the little bit I saw, was great, except for the \"history lesson\" we were given; a version that lacks a lot of facts. The museum houses, docked at the river bank, the only US boat captured during the conflict; the USS Pueblo, and visiting it was great",
          "Anyone who spends more than two days in North Korea will undoubtedly pass through this museum; I was led here by my guides the morning of my second full day in the country. Docent-led tours are mandatory, although only a single other tourist joined my group. The complex is",
          "Wow, where do you start, not very old, in pristine condition, we were met with the local guide at the entrance, she was so friendly and nice, she spoke very good English, wanted to learn so much about Australia, she go past many static displays of captured US tanks, planes,",
          "Great War museum, this. Sent an afternoon there, but could easily have spent 2 days, so much to see. USS Pueblo is as good as an exhibit as you are likely to see anywhere. Highly recommended.",
          "Its actually difficult to avoid it when you go on an organised trip to Pyongyang/DPRK. Its relatively new and quite interesting - of course they want you to know their view on the history (and basically all about their greatest enemy - US). Outdoor section includes a display of",
          "One of the highlights of my North Korea trip. It was incredible to here firsthand from our military guide the DPRK's version of the Korean War, and observe how they carefully select evidence to curate their own picture of history. A MUST for any history buff, especially if",
          "Don't take photos or you will be joining me on the naughty step. Great War museum where you can re-learn history and admire the lawn outside that is cut with scissors truly amazing back breaking work. The highlight of the museum is the panorama showing various scenes depicting",
          "This enlightening trip is another insight into DPRK and we had a fascinating afternoon touring this museum.",
          "Very impressed. They did an excellent job on this museum. It would rival any war museum that I have visited anywhere in the world. We only had a couple of hours but could have spent the entire day. It of course presents the history of the war from the view of the DPRK. It is",
          "an impressive museum - huge and we only saw a portion of it, Some really well presented exhibits - but others quite ghoulish. The Guide had been well schooled in what to say and didn't deviate at all from an obviously well memorised script. Propaganda a its best - but still well",
          "While you'll be subjected to propaganda during your entire stay in North Korea, the War Museum is one of the places where they lay it on thickest. You start outside, where they show you the trophies they collected in the war: American tanks and helicopters, with photos of the",
          "Of course it will tell you about the Korean war from other point of view and full of propaganda, but interestingly, it is actually well designed and well written. Some of the exhibition is very detailed and also has very eerie feeling. There is this wax exhibition about the",
          "Really disappointed in this museum because after looking closely it was clear that it was all fake. Basically the history is twisted to make it look glorious, when really it is based on hyped up propaganda. The North Korean authorities should be ashamed of his farce of a museum,",
          "Part of the its Part of tour you have To do.if you are a Guest in this Country. There Opi ion of the history and still Angel with the USA",
          "Having been to many war museums around the world I have never visited one like this. It is on a whole different scale to anything else anywhere! There are some incredible artefacts from history.",
          "I am a a huge nerd when it comes to wars and museum regarding this matter. Until I came to Pyongyang my favourite war related museum was the Imperial War Museum in London. The museum tour starts with the USS Pueblo and some movies regarding it. Outside the museum they show you",
          "The new part of the museum was opened in 2013 as a part of the 60-years celebration that DPRK won the war (!). The tour started with a female military guide telling about the Korean war. The story the guide told me was not like the one I learnt at school, but I did not question",
          "Visited this museum twice during two separate tours. A local guide, usually a female in uniform will lead the tour. The newly renovated museum is huge and the interior is opulent. A huge coloured statue of Kim II Sung greets you on top of huge marble stairs. One can see that a",
          "Traveling to Pyongyang to run the 2016 Pyongyang Marathon, I had the opportunity to visit the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum. Significant exhibits include the Battle of Daejon, and the USS Pueblo, the US Navy ship that was captured by North Korean forces in 1968.",
          "We arrived a bit late so were the last group to go through that day. You start with the war trophies of captured Imperialist weapons & shot down aircraft. You then get to see their pride & joy the captured USS Pueblo. You get to watch a victory movie (15min) before you move on",
          "As a veteran and former combat pilot, this was a tough pill to swallow. Severe graphic pictures of dead US servicemen, and over the top propaganda, even by North Korean standards. Getting to see and walk through THE USS Pueblo, was worth the future mental scars. The museum is",
          "...but if you're looking for an ACCURATE representation of history, look elsewhere. It was so twisted that it was hard to keep a straight face during the guide's explanation. LOL",
          "When we arrived it was something like 6 PM and dark. It looked like it the museum was especially open for us. The exhibition is a full treasure. But unfortuanately, the museum guide rushed the visit and the explanations. So, we could see maybe only 50% of it. Also, there is a",
          "I thought I had studied my far eastern history, well I was wrong. Worth a visit just to have a unique history lesson",
          "The museum is amazing, we were there for a couple of hours but only scratched the surface of what they have to offer. It is a lot of saying \"who started the war\" but besides that it does give you a look at their perspective and outlook on the war and how it still effects them",
          "Huge place full of the DPRK view of the Korean war. Very interesting and full of a perspective you won't hear outside the country. I was stunned by the grandeur of the place - possibly the most ostentatious museum I've visited.",
          "We got here quite late in the day and received a personalised tour through the museum by a tiny lady in full military uniform, her (obviously research speech) about the aggressive oppressors didn't match her look. Loved the video \"Who started the Korean war?\". The museum is",
          "This is a very large museum on which a vast sum of money must have been spent building it. On display outside a large numbers of Korean War relics that once belonged to the \"aggressive Americans\".",
          "The museum provided an interesting insight into the north Korean version of history. With amazingly manicured gardens to well maintained relics, this place is certainly worth a visit when in Pyongyang. The guides here had an excellent command of English and comms were made easy",
          "Yes, this is all about the greatness of the DPRK and how terrible Americans are. But the exhibits are very well designed and the whole experience is fascinating.",
          "Definitely ask your guides to put this on your itinerary when in DPRK (most do as standard but check). The site itself is vast and houses many captured military vehicles and artefacts which the museum guides will explain with immense pride. You need an open mind for this and",
          "This is a huge museum with lots of displays to explore. Huge statues of soldiers in various poses and vehicle remnants of the Korean War greet you at the outside entrance. The U.S.S. Pueblo is on a dock right besides the museum. The guide (dressed in military uniform) will tell",
          "Just like Mansudae Grand Monument, this place is a must for all tourist that wish to visit North Korea",
          "You must come here. The building its self is a work of art Just keep your mind open and your mouth shut. In some points it's very confronting and the point of view presented will challenge you, but just keep you mind open and take it all in",
          "Impressive museum, with a rather different perspective of the Korean war to the one we might be used to. The outside area has DPRK equipment on one side and captured/shot down equipment on the other. Inside there was a huge amount of material, beautifully presented, with a 360",
          "The museum is the usual mix of DRPK propaganda and selective history and is compulsory. At least you don't have to look at everything and the Pueblo was interesting.",
          "A must-visit to hear the North Korean's version of the liberation war and the Korean war. Photography is allowed outside but not inside of the museum. Included the USS Pueblo, docked along the river next to the museum, which had been captured from the US. Impressive exhibits.",
          "The museum decor is like a five star hotel and the displays include the captured US spy vessel. There is little recognition of the key role that China played in the Korean War. Worth a visit.",
          "Hard to explain how impressive this place is, both outside and inside. It would probably take more than a day to visit entirely. Very well done exhibitions, although it fails to mention the massive help they received from China, which certainly played a key role in the final",
          "A very important and historical place for all visitor's to see. Lots of interesting details and very well organised. Good staff and with knowledge and information. Strongly recommend.",
          "I've never seen a War Museum quite as grand as this one! The statue of Kim Il Sung as you enter is impressive but just so over the top. I have never seen anything quite like it. It is absolutely fascinating to learn about the war from the North Korean perspective. There were",
          "It's one of the very best museums you can visit. There's taken care of all details. It takes at least an hour.",
          "Beautiful/spotless museum & grounds.. Loud emotional music deliberately played whilst being shown propaganda of painted paintings of American war crimes.. Time & time the guide/guard will ask you \"If this is upsetting, please sit outside\", almost willing you into a state of",
          "I wish we'd been able to spend an entire afternoon here, as there were plenty of rooms we only passed by. The dioramas of the anguished Americans were fascinating, and the entire perspective and focus of the museum emphasised how much the Korean War and its aftermath dominate",
          "Pyongyang is a city like no other, This 100 million dollar museum built by the great leader in the showcase capital just shows how much money the Pyongyang elite are willing to spend to protect and \"educate\" others of the war they supposedly won. Go into this willing to be told",
          "One of the most beautiful museums I have ever been to. If you did not read about the Korean war before the visit you will after. It is fantastic and scary at the same time how a regime can change the history and present it in a believable way. No sign of Chinese / Russian",
          "This place was amazing, I really hope you get to visit it as part of your tour. Highlights: - The USS Pueblo, including photos of the soldiers they were very proud to have killed, and lots of talk about how 'The US Imperialists' are idiots who they bested. - The hanger filled",
          "Do your homework concerning the Korean War before you go. Once there be prepared to hear and see a completely alternate reality presented to you. A reality so completely divorced from what anyone else in the world thinks or has studied. This is where Orwellian mindset becomes",
          "Our guide told us that it would take her four days to take us through the museum. It is huge. Elaborate. The statutes of Kim Il Sung and son when you enter will blow you away. Unfortunately, no pictures inside. Only go if you do not get phased by seeing lots graphic",
          "Yeah, you get to hear their side of the story for the Korean war. Yeah, Americans are bad guys, and they are one big family with South Korea. Just, try not to laugh.",
          "While you may not agree with everything in this museum it is a masterful example of the regime and the new museum building is definitely worthwhile seeing.",
          "Another Kim Family Relic. All devoted to the dead president for life, Kim Il Sung. Also another place where I was completely alone surrounded by armed \"guides\". Extremely interesting if you are in to The Kim Family and their unbelieavble history.",
          "One of the more impressive places during my visit. You will hear a different view on historical facts. Up to you if you accept it or not.",
          "You've heard the American side of the story before to get here in the first place so It's only fair to get a detailed view from this side too... Very interesting!! Fiction or facts.. What you take home is up to ur understanding of where this country comes from... What the people",
          "This is so one-sided if you are an American you might rage against this. We are (of course) in a group tour led by one of their soldiers and she only showed us to the right side of the entrance where they kept the American planes, helicopters, bombs, gums, tanks that were being",
          "Washington might not have a museum as grand as this Great from the outside Many exhibits and battle scene recreation Highly recommended Guide was very cute too",
          "The guides explain the history of the war from the prospective of the DPRK. Various massive rooms had dioramas, tanks, planes and much more.",
          "The first thing that strikes you is the number of brides going to be photographed there. Then it's the vast spaces that have to be traversed, both outside and in, like all PDRK attractions, it has vast corridors and much bowing to statues. It is a very interesting, if one sided",
          "A very interesting museum but understand that the North Korean version of history is fanciful to say the least.",
          "If you want the other guys point of view this is where to go, heavy on the propaganda, whether justified or not, this museum has a collection of captured (or found) American hardware that the Smithsonian would envy. our guide was excellent, but the Americans in our group did get",
          "Like all landmarks in Pyongyang, this is an imposing and incredible place. Naturally it is very anti-American and they make a big deal of the equipment captures from the US forces, especially the USS Pueblo moored outside the museum. The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War",
          "Some nice propaganda is included, which makes this a museum that you will remember. My advice is to read up on everything you hear after (or prior to) your visit, when you're in the free world again.",
          "North Koreans call the 50s' Korean War the \"Victorious Fatherland Liberation War\" while for the rest of the world is known as \"the forgotten war\". History tells us that this war began with Kim Il Sung army stiking against South Korea in June 1950 but in this Museum your guide",
          "great museum and it also hosts the USS Pueblo (AGER-2) the captured USA spy ship, it also has some Korean and USA vehicles and planes. The small statues are pretty cool and the main statue is very impressive in my opinion one of the best communist style statues ive seen. The",
          "My son and I visited this museum as part of our tour itinerary. We were looking forward to it, as there were very good reviews, and it did not disappoint. The tour started with a walk through the \"artillery section\" in front of the museum. Korean weapons used were displayed to",
          "Propaganda in its most obvious form, but excellent displays, high variety of objects, with inside and outside building, plus the captured Pueblo ship, which is very interesting",
          "Go with a really open mind. I visited it twice (bec I had to) and there is a lot of history interspersed with the common Korean collective thought.",
          "Did not do a full tour as this was the last place I visited before I had to rush to the airport. Impressive facade and interior - I am really awed by the grandeur of the interior and that huge crystal chandelier above the statue of their leader Kim II-sung. However no",
          "Visiting the museum with a guide gave us a great insight into the DPRK history and especially the War... The museum houses the USS Pueblo as well as weapons from the US military. The exhibit is an impressive shrine to war heroes and leaders.",
          "This is DPRK point of view at its very best. The museum is amazing, a huge amount of money and effort has gone into creating this. You will hear the story of the Korean war from the DPRK point of view and it is so interesting to hear them explain how a \"strategic withdrawal\"",
          "A very modern museum with lots to see, including shot down American aircraft, the USS Pueblo, and various other old artifacts.",
          "The guide was the most pretty gal in the country It tells the history of Korea war from the North Korean prospective",
          "The building is very grand, probably the best bit. Walk around the grounds along riverfront too. The actual exhibitions inside are a bit tacky. The video we watched was very one sided. Some of the imagery and depictions were distasteful.",
          "The building itself is immaculate. After first viewing captured U.S. military equipment from the Korean War, you are lead inside the museum to the grand hall. There is a huge statue of Kim Jong-Un (the current leader), but they will claim it is of Kim Il-Sung in his youth.",
          "SUMMARY: A beautiful campus with new impressive buildings, parks, 60-year-old war machinery, and the USS Pueblo anchored in the river making up one of the boundaries of the compound. A must-see. I wanted to sit on the grass all day just taking in the atmosphere but of course",
          "It is new and an amazing building done in a most spectacular way with the best marble brass glass with world class designs in architecture can wait to see it again",
          "This is a large museum that takes a long time to get around. The first thing you will see are a lot of captured US vehicles, finishing with the captured USS Pueblo which you get to go inside. Afterwards you get to go into the museum itself. The museum is interesting, full of",
          "Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos inside of the museum. Keep in mind that this is the brand new opened museum; seems that the last one was not that good. Have seen many memorial and war museums ( WAW, Johannesburg), but by far this is the most impressive one! The",
          "The building is over impressive for what it contains. The only thing unique or of historical interest is the USS Pueblo (which we didn't get to visit!). The place is just filled up with anything left over from the war. I much preferred the war museum in Dandong especially the",
          "The war museum is really beautiful. Of course, the history is only only under a DPRK perspective but this is expected right? There are 2 big areas outside the museum one with all the equipments captured by the DPRK army and another one with the equipment used by the DPRK army",
          "Very impressive museum showing the events of Korean war from the viewpoint of North Korea. The building and especially the panorama painting on top floor of the building are very spectacular. They also present a huge collection of captured US military equipment. Don't miss that",
          "This was only one of many eye-opening, paradigm-challenging experiences on this trip to Pyongyang and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [aka North Korea]. It's sometimes difficult to see how others experience us, particularly our role in the Korean War. But",
          "This is a spectacular building with impressive monuments and statues in the front square. There is a collection of US military hardware from the Korean war and also the captured spy ship the USS Pueblo. The exhibition itself is huge and the guide tends to rush you through it. I",
          "This is honestly one of the best war museums I have ever visited, I was really impressed with the way it has been done. This was not supposed to feature on our tour, but we got lucky and are so happy that we got to see it. We suggested to our guides that it should be included in",
          "A stunning propaganda piece - it's the best re writing of history I have ever seen ( even better than the Egyptian Army war museum and the narratives of how they won the Six day war). A must visit for all \"spin doctors\"!",
          "Visiting the USS Pueblo is always good. The museum is very new (rebuilt in 2013) and it's quite grand and lavish. The graphics sometimes are not really what a western would expect, but that's in common with Seoul. And the propaganda is amazing. You don't get such propaganda",
          "The best museum I have seen and probably one of the best in the world. The museum is now in its new building (next to the old one) and its truly amazing. As other reviewers have stated, its not possible to take photos inside which is such a shame as its truly stunning. The",
          "Very nice museum which shows all the history of the Koreas since the mess hit the fan years ago. It's the cleanest newest piece of architecture you'll find in Pyonyabg apart from the pyramid-skyscraper.",
          "The museum isn't that bad, really, but you'll have to go there on a guided tour, which will mean you'll spend a long time hearing about things you're probably not that interested in, instead of being allowed to look at the bits that may actually give you something. There's a",
          "OK, first of all lets get one thing straight. This museum tells only one side of the story. Its pure brain washing propaganda. That said, in terms of getting its message across, its one of the best museums I've ever been too. The exhibits (whilst not all in English) are",
          "Once in Pyongyang you'll immediately notice that it is very important for the North Koreans to tell you their side of the story. No photos allowed to be taken inside the museum. A guide is provided to narrate and walk you through the museum and their version of the Korean War.",
          "The North's view of the Korean War. Propaganda is everywhere. You will be shown a video of American atrocities or something like that, a play of something revolutionary and lots of artefacts proving that the Americans were the aggressors. Interesting for someone interested in",
          "another fascinating musuem with captured artifacts and a review of the history of the korean war , some of the english could do with improvement at the museum",
          "yes, we all know its pure propaganda with hardly a shed of truth told within its walls. But some of the exihibits are interesting, at least the captured military equipment from the 1953 korean war. It has been fairly well preserved though I have seen better examples in Japan",
          "This museum exceeded my expectations and was one of the unexpected highlights of my trip to the DPRK. Sure, it presents the history of the Korean War from the very unique perspective of the north, but I was surprised by the quality and craftsmanship of the displays. One of the",
          "I was very much in awe at some of the dramatic scenes depicted in the artwork. I am talking of walking through Universal Studio type displays. The realism of the artwork makes it difficult not to imagine that you are actually in the scene being depicted. It is very well done.",
          "They have just relocated and renovated this museum in 2012. I visited its new site, near the river. This is also a good spot to take photos of the Ryugong hotel also. We were met my a female guide who was a soldier and spoke good English. Outside have many statues displaying",
          "Last summer I, a born and bred American, traveled to North Korea for a week. It was a fascinating trip and all in all, I really enjoyed myself and learned a lot. However, I can see how very many Americans would be EXTREMELY uncomfortable in North Korea and especially in the",
          "You hear those words a lot in North Korea, a country stuck in the Korean war days, but this is where you will hear them most- every other sentence. Our guide asked why we were laughing so much and we told her. She got a little better after that. I particularly noted the diorama",
          "You have to be prepared for this as an American- we are the enemy- that you can accept, but some of the exhibitions are beyond the pale, like a diorama with a full sized dead American soldier with a crow standing on his body, picking at his flesh.",

          "Amazing architecture and fabulous modern interactive museum with an impressive panorama BUT the dioramas of dead allied soldiers being picked at by crows and the torn flags can cause distress. However, this is what you signed up for!",
          "its side of the history was hardly told to the world. might be a little propagandist, but who doesn\u2019t have a position. the fact that over 400,000 bombs dropped in pyongyang with a population of the same were a crime in itself. chemical weapons were used too. an impressive",
          "My favorite war museum in the world!!! Impressive display, well maintenanced, well organized. The US spy ship display is one of a kind. The 360 panoramic war picture with spinning stage is as good as it gets. This is a must visit if you're in Pyongyang.",
          "This is an incredible collection of Korean War artefacts including USS Peublo and US military equipment. Guides provide an excellent overview of the DPRK perspective on the War. Humbling and thought provoking exhibit.",
          "It's good to hear the other side of the story... And you certainly here that during your tour. Our war museum guide was very nice and the visit past the captured American trucks/guns/tanks/planes and the USS Pueblo was fascinating. Inside there's a huge statue of the",
          "Beautiful grounds, friendly guides, and an incredible interactive experience inside. Truly have never experienced a museum like this - it was huge and beautiful, and though I didn't get to go through every exhibit, I was particularly impressed by the level of detail they put",
          "Fast tempo walking and listening to your guide. The revolving stage and presentation of the war was interesting, but totaly onesided of course. The building is impressive.",
          "They have since my last visit moved the museum to a new building just next to the old one. Worth a stop.",
          "Cold war propaganda distorted our understandings of this terrible war (1950-53) and its consequences. Here is the side from that part of Korea which was not conquered and colonised. Trophies from the US war machine, tales of resistance and the final US capitulation. An",
          "Of course, the museum is organised from the North Korean perspective. Rightly so. It brings you very close to the reality of war. With images. Movies. Captured airplanes, tanks etc. With reconstructions of war scenes etc. All in all impressive. Also to see the clear Northern",
          "I was actually quite impressed by this museum. A lot of propaganda, as expected. But the museum is really very well made. A combination of modern and traditional, and enormous in size. We had very limited time to spend so it felt more like a marathon than a walk in the museum.",
          "I went in May 2018, and our group was here for about 2 hours--i wish we had a whole day here. I'm neither a war buff, nor a museum buff, but the exhibits here are fascinating (and the USS Pueblo is awesome!). There's a gigantic wax figure of Kim Jong il at the entrance that will",
          "One of those almost compulsory visits in any DPRK tour itinerary so it's just a matter of going thru the motions and putting up with the distorted view of the world being pushed by the guides. It's interesting just to hear what they say and see what's on display without any need",
          "I already been in met moma london museums, louvre etc but this one is amazing. The museum is super new and everything is really well done... You can see a 3d effects and a demonstration of how everything happened at this time... Simulations, panormas etc. Photos not allowed",
          "This museum has recently been rebuilt and I have to admit it\u2019s pretty impressive. Outside you have numerous UN war vehicles that were left behind in Korea after the war. This also includes an American spy ship that the Korean people see as a great victory to have gained. Trust",
          "This was certainly an eye opener and it surpassed all my expectations. Usually I do not like to visit war museums, but this was the BEST EVER. Unfortunately one cannot take any pictures inside the museum, because ALL the exhibitions are fascinating and very realistic. The",
          "When visiting DPRK it's hard to know what to expect, there's not much information out there. Well museum was excellent, newly refurbished with excellent facility's and fascinating exhibitions. The navy ship outside is incredible, the rotating timeline in the roof is amazing too.",
          "You will be taken there and shown the DPRK's view of the war against the Japanese occupation and the US intervention. A highlight is a clamber around the spy ship USS Pueblo. How they got it up the Taedong River from the east coast where it was captured is a mystery. But it",
          "The museum is now housed in a new building which sets off its contents brilliantly. Our guide, a female officer in the DPRK army showed us firstly destroyed American military hardware and then the spy ship US Pueblo (captured in 1968) which was moored nearby. The grounds of the",
          "Glorious places, great architecture, impressive, oh I love it so much, i will go there in every free time, beautiful just like sunshine!",
          "A great museum with the DPRK (North Korean) account of the Korean War. Having read Max Hastings book about the Korean War and having first visited the South, it was interesting to see the DPRK's point of view. There are very interesting captured American hardware including a",
          "This museum is at a level of any museum in Europe; with the exception of few information in English. Nice exhibitions on the different rooms, and a live diorama of a famous battle in NK. On the outside, you can take pictures to the tanks captured by NK. You need 3-4h to fully",
          "Needed more time there, but the little bit I saw, was great, except for the \"history lesson\" we were given; a version that lacks a lot of facts. The museum houses, docked at the river bank, the only US boat captured during the conflict; the USS Pueblo, and visiting it was great",
          "Anyone who spends more than two days in North Korea will undoubtedly pass through this museum; I was led here by my guides the morning of my second full day in the country. Docent-led tours are mandatory, although only a single other tourist joined my group. The complex is",
          "Wow, where do you start, not very old, in pristine condition, we were met with the local guide at the entrance, she was so friendly and nice, she spoke very good English, wanted to learn so much about Australia, she go past many static displays of captured US tanks, planes,",
          "Great War museum, this. Sent an afternoon there, but could easily have spent 2 days, so much to see. USS Pueblo is as good as an exhibit as you are likely to see anywhere. Highly recommended.",
          "Its actually difficult to avoid it when you go on an organised trip to Pyongyang/DPRK. Its relatively new and quite interesting - of course they want you to know their view on the history (and basically all about their greatest enemy - US). Outdoor section includes a display of",
          "One of the highlights of my North Korea trip. It was incredible to here firsthand from our military guide the DPRK's version of the Korean War, and observe how they carefully select evidence to curate their own picture of history. A MUST for any history buff, especially if",
          "Don't take photos or you will be joining me on the naughty step. Great War museum where you can re-learn history and admire the lawn outside that is cut with scissors truly amazing back breaking work. The highlight of the museum is the panorama showing various scenes depicting",
          "This enlightening trip is another insight into DPRK and we had a fascinating afternoon touring this museum.",
          "Very impressed. They did an excellent job on this museum. It would rival any war museum that I have visited anywhere in the world. We only had a couple of hours but could have spent the entire day. It of course presents the history of the war from the view of the DPRK. It is",
          "an impressive museum - huge and we only saw a portion of it, Some really well presented exhibits - but others quite ghoulish. The Guide had been well schooled in what to say and didn't deviate at all from an obviously well memorised script. Propaganda a its best - but still well",
          "While you'll be subjected to propaganda during your entire stay in North Korea, the War Museum is one of the places where they lay it on thickest. You start outside, where they show you the trophies they collected in the war: American tanks and helicopters, with photos of the",
          "Of course it will tell you about the Korean war from other point of view and full of propaganda, but interestingly, it is actually well designed and well written. Some of the exhibition is very detailed and also has very eerie feeling. There is this wax exhibition about the",
          "Really disappointed in this museum because after looking closely it was clear that it was all fake. Basically the history is twisted to make it look glorious, when really it is based on hyped up propaganda. The North Korean authorities should be ashamed of his farce of a museum,",
          "Part of the its Part of tour you have To do.if you are a Guest in this Country. There Opi ion of the history and still Angel with the USA",
          "Having been to many war museums around the world I have never visited one like this. It is on a whole different scale to anything else anywhere! There are some incredible artefacts from history.",
          "I am a a huge nerd when it comes to wars and museum regarding this matter. Until I came to Pyongyang my favourite war related museum was the Imperial War Museum in London. The museum tour starts with the USS Pueblo and some movies regarding it. Outside the museum they show you",
          "The new part of the museum was opened in 2013 as a part of the 60-years celebration that DPRK won the war (!). The tour started with a female military guide telling about the Korean war. The story the guide told me was not like the one I learnt at school, but I did not question",
          "Visited this museum twice during two separate tours. A local guide, usually a female in uniform will lead the tour. The newly renovated museum is huge and the interior is opulent. A huge coloured statue of Kim II Sung greets you on top of huge marble stairs. One can see that a",
          "Traveling to Pyongyang to run the 2016 Pyongyang Marathon, I had the opportunity to visit the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum. Significant exhibits include the Battle of Daejon, and the USS Pueblo, the US Navy ship that was captured by North Korean forces in 1968.",
          "We arrived a bit late so were the last group to go through that day. You start with the war trophies of captured Imperialist weapons & shot down aircraft. You then get to see their pride & joy the captured USS Pueblo. You get to watch a victory movie (15min) before you move on",
          "As a veteran and former combat pilot, this was a tough pill to swallow. Severe graphic pictures of dead US servicemen, and over the top propaganda, even by North Korean standards. Getting to see and walk through THE USS Pueblo, was worth the future mental scars. The museum is",
          "...but if you're looking for an ACCURATE representation of history, look elsewhere. It was so twisted that it was hard to keep a straight face during the guide's explanation. LOL",
          "When we arrived it was something like 6 PM and dark. It looked like it the museum was especially open for us. The exhibition is a full treasure. But unfortuanately, the museum guide rushed the visit and the explanations. So, we could see maybe only 50% of it. Also, there is a",
          "I thought I had studied my far eastern history, well I was wrong. Worth a visit just to have a unique history lesson",
          "The museum is amazing, we were there for a couple of hours but only scratched the surface of what they have to offer. It is a lot of saying \"who started the war\" but besides that it does give you a look at their perspective and outlook on the war and how it still effects them",
          "Huge place full of the DPRK view of the Korean war. Very interesting and full of a perspective you won't hear outside the country. I was stunned by the grandeur of the place - possibly the most ostentatious museum I've visited.",
          "We got here quite late in the day and received a personalised tour through the museum by a tiny lady in full military uniform, her (obviously research speech) about the aggressive oppressors didn't match her look. Loved the video \"Who started the Korean war?\". The museum is",
          "This is a very large museum on which a vast sum of money must have been spent building it. On display outside a large numbers of Korean War relics that once belonged to the \"aggressive Americans\".",
          "The museum provided an interesting insight into the north Korean version of history. With amazingly manicured gardens to well maintained relics, this place is certainly worth a visit when in Pyongyang. The guides here had an excellent command of English and comms were made easy",
          "Yes, this is all about the greatness of the DPRK and how terrible Americans are. But the exhibits are very well designed and the whole experience is fascinating.",
          "Definitely ask your guides to put this on your itinerary when in DPRK (most do as standard but check). The site itself is vast and houses many captured military vehicles and artefacts which the museum guides will explain with immense pride. You need an open mind for this and",
          "This is a huge museum with lots of displays to explore. Huge statues of soldiers in various poses and vehicle remnants of the Korean War greet you at the outside entrance. The U.S.S. Pueblo is on a dock right besides the museum. The guide (dressed in military uniform) will tell",
          "Just like Mansudae Grand Monument, this place is a must for all tourist that wish to visit North Korea",
          "You must come here. The building its self is a work of art Just keep your mind open and your mouth shut. In some points it's very confronting and the point of view presented will challenge you, but just keep you mind open and take it all in",
          "Impressive museum, with a rather different perspective of the Korean war to the one we might be used to. The outside area has DPRK equipment on one side and captured/shot down equipment on the other. Inside there was a huge amount of material, beautifully presented, with a 360",
          "The museum is the usual mix of DRPK propaganda and selective history and is compulsory. At least you don't have to look at everything and the Pueblo was interesting.",
          "A must-visit to hear the North Korean's version of the liberation war and the Korean war. Photography is allowed outside but not inside of the museum. Included the USS Pueblo, docked along the river next to the museum, which had been captured from the US. Impressive exhibits.",
          "The museum decor is like a five star hotel and the displays include the captured US spy vessel. There is little recognition of the key role that China played in the Korean War. Worth a visit.",
          "Hard to explain how impressive this place is, both outside and inside. It would probably take more than a day to visit entirely. Very well done exhibitions, although it fails to mention the massive help they received from China, which certainly played a key role in the final",
          "A very important and historical place for all visitor's to see. Lots of interesting details and very well organised. Good staff and with knowledge and information. Strongly recommend.",
          "I've never seen a War Museum quite as grand as this one! The statue of Kim Il Sung as you enter is impressive but just so over the top. I have never seen anything quite like it. It is absolutely fascinating to learn about the war from the North Korean perspective. There were",
          "It's one of the very best museums you can visit. There's taken care of all details. It takes at least an hour.",
          "Beautiful/spotless museum & grounds.. Loud emotional music deliberately played whilst being shown propaganda of painted paintings of American war crimes.. Time & time the guide/guard will ask you \"If this is upsetting, please sit outside\", almost willing you into a state of",
          "I wish we'd been able to spend an entire afternoon here, as there were plenty of rooms we only passed by. The dioramas of the anguished Americans were fascinating, and the entire perspective and focus of the museum emphasised how much the Korean War and its aftermath dominate",
          "Pyongyang is a city like no other, This 100 million dollar museum built by the great leader in the showcase capital just shows how much money the Pyongyang elite are willing to spend to protect and \"educate\" others of the war they supposedly won. Go into this willing to be told",
          "One of the most beautiful museums I have ever been to. If you did not read about the Korean war before the visit you will after. It is fantastic and scary at the same time how a regime can change the history and present it in a believable way. No sign of Chinese / Russian",
          "This place was amazing, I really hope you get to visit it as part of your tour. Highlights: - The USS Pueblo, including photos of the soldiers they were very proud to have killed, and lots of talk about how 'The US Imperialists' are idiots who they bested. - The hanger filled",
          "Do your homework concerning the Korean War before you go. Once there be prepared to hear and see a completely alternate reality presented to you. A reality so completely divorced from what anyone else in the world thinks or has studied. This is where Orwellian mindset becomes",
          "Our guide told us that it would take her four days to take us through the museum. It is huge. Elaborate. The statutes of Kim Il Sung and son when you enter will blow you away. Unfortunately, no pictures inside. Only go if you do not get phased by seeing lots graphic",
          "Yeah, you get to hear their side of the story for the Korean war. Yeah, Americans are bad guys, and they are one big family with South Korea. Just, try not to laugh.",
          "While you may not agree with everything in this museum it is a masterful example of the regime and the new museum building is definitely worthwhile seeing.",
          "Another Kim Family Relic. All devoted to the dead president for life, Kim Il Sung. Also another place where I was completely alone surrounded by armed \"guides\". Extremely interesting if you are in to The Kim Family and their unbelieavble history.",
          "One of the more impressive places during my visit. You will hear a different view on historical facts. Up to you if you accept it or not.",
          "You've heard the American side of the story before to get here in the first place so It's only fair to get a detailed view from this side too... Very interesting!! Fiction or facts.. What you take home is up to ur understanding of where this country comes from... What the people",
          "This is so one-sided if you are an American you might rage against this. We are (of course) in a group tour led by one of their soldiers and she only showed us to the right side of the entrance where they kept the American planes, helicopters, bombs, gums, tanks that were being",
          "Washington might not have a museum as grand as this Great from the outside Many exhibits and battle scene recreation Highly recommended Guide was very cute too",
          "The guides explain the history of the war from the prospective of the DPRK. Various massive rooms had dioramas, tanks, planes and much more.",
          "The first thing that strikes you is the number of brides going to be photographed there. Then it's the vast spaces that have to be traversed, both outside and in, like all PDRK attractions, it has vast corridors and much bowing to statues. It is a very interesting, if one sided",
          "A very interesting museum but understand that the North Korean version of history is fanciful to say the least.",
          "If you want the other guys point of view this is where to go, heavy on the propaganda, whether justified or not, this museum has a collection of captured (or found) American hardware that the Smithsonian would envy. our guide was excellent, but the Americans in our group did get",
          "Like all landmarks in Pyongyang, this is an imposing and incredible place. Naturally it is very anti-American and they make a big deal of the equipment captures from the US forces, especially the USS Pueblo moored outside the museum. The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War",
          "Some nice propaganda is included, which makes this a museum that you will remember. My advice is to read up on everything you hear after (or prior to) your visit, when you're in the free world again.",
          "North Koreans call the 50s' Korean War the \"Victorious Fatherland Liberation War\" while for the rest of the world is known as \"the forgotten war\". History tells us that this war began with Kim Il Sung army stiking against South Korea in June 1950 but in this Museum your guide",
          "great museum and it also hosts the USS Pueblo (AGER-2) the captured USA spy ship, it also has some Korean and USA vehicles and planes. The small statues are pretty cool and the main statue is very impressive in my opinion one of the best communist style statues ive seen. The",
          "My son and I visited this museum as part of our tour itinerary. We were looking forward to it, as there were very good reviews, and it did not disappoint. The tour started with a walk through the \"artillery section\" in front of the museum. Korean weapons used were displayed to",
          "Propaganda in its most obvious form, but excellent displays, high variety of objects, with inside and outside building, plus the captured Pueblo ship, which is very interesting",
          "Go with a really open mind. I visited it twice (bec I had to) and there is a lot of history interspersed with the common Korean collective thought.",
          "Did not do a full tour as this was the last place I visited before I had to rush to the airport. Impressive facade and interior - I am really awed by the grandeur of the interior and that huge crystal chandelier above the statue of their leader Kim II-sung. However no",
          "Visiting the museum with a guide gave us a great insight into the DPRK history and especially the War... The museum houses the USS Pueblo as well as weapons from the US military. The exhibit is an impressive shrine to war heroes and leaders.",
          "This is DPRK point of view at its very best. The museum is amazing, a huge amount of money and effort has gone into creating this. You will hear the story of the Korean war from the DPRK point of view and it is so interesting to hear them explain how a \"strategic withdrawal\"",
          "A very modern museum with lots to see, including shot down American aircraft, the USS Pueblo, and various other old artifacts.",
          "The guide was the most pretty gal in the country It tells the history of Korea war from the North Korean prospective",
          "The building is very grand, probably the best bit. Walk around the grounds along riverfront too. The actual exhibitions inside are a bit tacky. The video we watched was very one sided. Some of the imagery and depictions were distasteful.",
          "The building itself is immaculate. After first viewing captured U.S. military equipment from the Korean War, you are lead inside the museum to the grand hall. There is a huge statue of Kim Jong-Un (the current leader), but they will claim it is of Kim Il-Sung in his youth.",
          "SUMMARY: A beautiful campus with new impressive buildings, parks, 60-year-old war machinery, and the USS Pueblo anchored in the river making up one of the boundaries of the compound. A must-see. I wanted to sit on the grass all day just taking in the atmosphere but of course",
          "It is new and an amazing building done in a most spectacular way with the best marble brass glass with world class designs in architecture can wait to see it again",
          "This is a large museum that takes a long time to get around. The first thing you will see are a lot of captured US vehicles, finishing with the captured USS Pueblo which you get to go inside. Afterwards you get to go into the museum itself. The museum is interesting, full of",
          "Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos inside of the museum. Keep in mind that this is the brand new opened museum; seems that the last one was not that good. Have seen many memorial and war museums ( WAW, Johannesburg), but by far this is the most impressive one! The",
          "The building is over impressive for what it contains. The only thing unique or of historical interest is the USS Pueblo (which we didn't get to visit!). The place is just filled up with anything left over from the war. I much preferred the war museum in Dandong especially the",
          "The war museum is really beautiful. Of course, the history is only only under a DPRK perspective but this is expected right? There are 2 big areas outside the museum one with all the equipments captured by the DPRK army and another one with the equipment used by the DPRK army",
          "Very impressive museum showing the events of Korean war from the viewpoint of North Korea. The building and especially the panorama painting on top floor of the building are very spectacular. They also present a huge collection of captured US military equipment. Don't miss that",
          "This was only one of many eye-opening, paradigm-challenging experiences on this trip to Pyongyang and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [aka North Korea]. It's sometimes difficult to see how others experience us, particularly our role in the Korean War. But",
          "This is a spectacular building with impressive monuments and statues in the front square. There is a collection of US military hardware from the Korean war and also the captured spy ship the USS Pueblo. The exhibition itself is huge and the guide tends to rush you through it. I",
          "This is honestly one of the best war museums I have ever visited, I was really impressed with the way it has been done. This was not supposed to feature on our tour, but we got lucky and are so happy that we got to see it. We suggested to our guides that it should be included in",
          "A stunning propaganda piece - it's the best re writing of history I have ever seen ( even better than the Egyptian Army war museum and the narratives of how they won the Six day war). A must visit for all \"spin doctors\"!",
          "Visiting the USS Pueblo is always good. The museum is very new (rebuilt in 2013) and it's quite grand and lavish. The graphics sometimes are not really what a western would expect, but that's in common with Seoul. And the propaganda is amazing. You don't get such propaganda",
          "The best museum I have seen and probably one of the best in the world. The museum is now in its new building (next to the old one) and its truly amazing. As other reviewers have stated, its not possible to take photos inside which is such a shame as its truly stunning. The",
          "Very nice museum which shows all the history of the Koreas since the mess hit the fan years ago. It's the cleanest newest piece of architecture you'll find in Pyonyabg apart from the pyramid-skyscraper.",
          "The museum isn't that bad, really, but you'll have to go there on a guided tour, which will mean you'll spend a long time hearing about things you're probably not that interested in, instead of being allowed to look at the bits that may actually give you something. There's a",
          "OK, first of all lets get one thing straight. This museum tells only one side of the story. Its pure brain washing propaganda. That said, in terms of getting its message across, its one of the best museums I've ever been too. The exhibits (whilst not all in English) are",
          "Once in Pyongyang you'll immediately notice that it is very important for the North Koreans to tell you their side of the story. No photos allowed to be taken inside the museum. A guide is provided to narrate and walk you through the museum and their version of the Korean War.",
          "The North's view of the Korean War. Propaganda is everywhere. You will be shown a video of American atrocities or something like that, a play of something revolutionary and lots of artefacts proving that the Americans were the aggressors. Interesting for someone interested in",
          "another fascinating musuem with captured artifacts and a review of the history of the korean war , some of the english could do with improvement at the museum",
          "yes, we all know its pure propaganda with hardly a shed of truth told within its walls. But some of the exihibits are interesting, at least the captured military equipment from the 1953 korean war. It has been fairly well preserved though I have seen better examples in Japan",
          "This museum exceeded my expectations and was one of the unexpected highlights of my trip to the DPRK. Sure, it presents the history of the Korean War from the very unique perspective of the north, but I was surprised by the quality and craftsmanship of the displays. One of the",
          "I was very much in awe at some of the dramatic scenes depicted in the artwork. I am talking of walking through Universal Studio type displays. The realism of the artwork makes it difficult not to imagine that you are actually in the scene being depicted. It is very well done.",
          "They have just relocated and renovated this museum in 2012. I visited its new site, near the river. This is also a good spot to take photos of the Ryugong hotel also. We were met my a female guide who was a soldier and spoke good English. Outside have many statues displaying",
          "Last summer I, a born and bred American, traveled to North Korea for a week. It was a fascinating trip and all in all, I really enjoyed myself and learned a lot. However, I can see how very many Americans would be EXTREMELY uncomfortable in North Korea and especially in the",
          "You hear those words a lot in North Korea, a country stuck in the Korean war days, but this is where you will hear them most- every other sentence. Our guide asked why we were laughing so much and we told her. She got a little better after that. I particularly noted the diorama",
          "You have to be prepared for this as an American- we are the enemy- that you can accept, but some of the exhibitions are beyond the pale, like a diorama with a full sized dead American soldier with a crow standing on his body, picking at his flesh.",
          "Only the north koreans could build something like this, don't miss it if you get the chance to visit it."

        "wiki": "USS Pueblo (AGER-2) is a Banner-class environmental research ship, attached to Navy intelligence as a spy ship, which was attacked and captured by North Korean forces on 23 January 1968, in what is known today as the \"Pueblo incident\" or alternatively, as the \"Pueblo crisis\".\nThe seizure of the U.S. Navy ship and her 83 crew members, one of whom was killed in the attack, came less than a week after President Lyndon B. Johnson's State of the Union address to the United States Congress, a week before the start of the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War and three days after 31 men of North Korea's KPA Unit 124 had crossed the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans in an attempt to attack the South Korean Blue House (executive mansion) in the capital Seoul. The taking of Pueblo and the abuse and torture of her crew during the subsequent 11-month prisoner drama became a major Cold War incident, raising tensions between western and eastern powers.\nNorth Korea stated that Pueblo deliberately entered their territorial waters 7.6 nautical miles (14 km) away from Ryo Island, and that the logbook shows that they intruded several times. However, the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident and that any purported evidence supplied by North Korea to support its statements was fabricated. Pueblo, still held by North Korea today, officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy. Since early 2013, the ship has been moored along the Pothong River in Pyongyang and used there as a museum ship at the Victorious War Museum. Pueblo is the only ship of the U.S. Navy still on the commissioned roster currently being held captive.\n\n\n== Initial operations ==\n\nThe ship was launched at the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, on 16 April 1944, as the United States Army Freight and Passenger (FP) FP-344. The Army later redesignated the FP vessels as Freight and Supply changing the designation to FS-344. The ship, commissioned at New Orleans on 7 April 1945, served as a Coast Guard\u2013manned Army vessel used for training civilians for the Army. Her first commanding officer was Lt. J. R. Choate, USCGR, succeeded by Lt. J.G. Marvin B. Barker, USCGR, on 12 September 1945.  FS-344 was placed out of service in 1954.\nIn 1964 the Department of Defense became interested in having smaller, less expensive, more flexible and responsive signals intelligence collection vessels than the existing AGTR and T-AG vessels. The mothballed light cargo ships were the most suitable existing DOD ships, and one was converted to USS Banner in 1964 and began operations in 1965.FS-344 was transferred to the United States Navy on 12 April 1966 and was renamed USS Pueblo (AKL-44) after Pueblo and Pueblo County, Colorado on 18 June. Initially, she was classified as a light cargo ship for basic refitting at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard during 1966. As Pueblo was prepared under a non-secret cover as a light cargo ship, the general crew staffing and training was on this basis, with 44% having never been to sea when first assigned. Installation of signals intelligence equipment, at a cost of $1.5 million, was delayed to 1967 for budgetary reasons, resuming service as what is colloquially known as a \"spy ship\" and redesignated AGER-2 on 13 May 1967. After testing and deficiency rework she sailed from the shipyard on 11 September 1967 to San Diego for shake-down training.\n\n\n== Pueblo incident ==\n\nOn 5 January 1968, Pueblo left the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, Japan, in transit to the U.S. naval base at Sasebo, Japan; from there she left on 11 January 1968, headed northward through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. She left with specific orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of Soviet Navy activity in the Tsushima Strait and to gather signal and electronic intelligence from North Korea. The declassified SIGAD for the National Security Agency (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the Naval Security Group (NSG) on Pueblo during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y. AGER (Auxiliary General Environmental Research) denoted a joint Naval and National Security Agency (NSA) program.On 16 January 1968, Pueblo arrived at the 42\u00b0N parallel in preparation for the patrol, which was to transit down the North Korean coast from 41\u00b0N to 39\u00b0N, and then back, without getting closer than 13 nautical miles from the North Korean coast, at night moving out to a distance of 18 to 20 nautical miles. This was challenging as only two sailors had good navigational experience, with the captain later reporting, \"I did not have a highly professional group of seamen to do my navigational chores for me.\"At 17:30 on 20 January 1968, a North Korean modified SO-1 class Soviet style submarine chaser passed within 4,000 yards (3.7 km) of Pueblo, which was about 15.4 nautical miles (28.5 km) southeast of Mayang-do at a position 39\u00b047'N and 128\u00b028.5'E.In the afternoon of 22 January 1968, the two North Korean fishing trawlers Rice Paddy 1 and Rice Paddy 2 passed within 30 yards (27 m) of Pueblo. That day, a North Korean unit made an assassination attempt at the Blue House executive mansion against South Korean president Park Chung-hee, but the crew of Pueblo was not informed.According to the American account, the following day, 23 January, Pueblo was approached by a submarine chaser and her nationality was challenged; Pueblo responded by raising the U.S. flag. The North Korean vessel then ordered Pueblo to stand down or be fired upon. Pueblo attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser. Several warning shots were fired. Additionally, three torpedo boats appeared on the horizon and then joined in the chase and subsequent attack.The attackers were soon joined by two MiG-21 fighters. A fourth torpedo boat and a second submarine chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later. The ammunition on Pueblo was stored below decks, and her machine guns were wrapped in cold-weather tarpaulins. The machine guns were unmanned, and no attempt was made to man them. An NSA report quotes the sailing order:\n\n( ... ) Defensive armament (machine guns) should be stowed or covered in such manner so that it does not cause unusual interest by surveyed units. It should be used only in the event of a threat to survival ( ... )\nand notes:\n\nIn practice, it was discovered that, because of the temperamental adjustments of the firing mechanisms, the .50-caliber machine guns took at least ten minutes to activate. Only one crew member, with former army experience, had ever had any experience with such weapons, although members of the crew had received rudimentary instructions on the weapons immediately prior to the ship's deployment.\n\nU.S. Navy authorities and the crew of Pueblo insist that before the capture, Pueblo was miles outside North Korean territorial waters. North Korea claims that the vessel was well within North Korean territory. The Pueblo's mission statement allowed her to approach within a nautical mile (1,852 m) of that limit. However, North Korea describes a 50-nautical-mile (93 km) sea boundary even though international standards were 12 nautical miles (22 km) at the time.The North Korean vessels attempted to board Pueblo, but she was maneuvered to prevent this for over two hours. A submarine chaser then opened fire with a 57 mm cannon, killing one member of the crew. The smaller vessels fired machine guns into Pueblo, which then signaled compliance, and its crew began destroying sensitive material. The volume of material on board was so great that it was impossible to destroy it all. An NSA report quotes Lieutenant Steve Harris, the officer in charge of Pueblo's Naval Security Group Command detachment:\n\n( ... ) we had retained on board the obsolete publications and had all good intentions of getting rid of these things but had not done so at the time we had started the mission. I wanted to get the place organized eventually and we had excessive numbers of copies on board ( ... )\nand concludes:\n\nOnly a small percentage of the total classified material aboard the ship was destroyed.\nRadio contact between Pueblo and the Naval Security Group in Kamiseya, Japan had been ongoing during the incident. As a result, Seventh Fleet command was fully aware of Pueblo's situation. Air cover was promised but never arrived. The Fifth Air Force had no aircraft on strip alert, and estimated a two-to-three-hour delay in launching aircraft. USS Enterprise was located 510 nautical miles (940 km) south of Pueblo, yet her four F-4B aircraft on alert were not equipped for an air-to-surface engagement. Enterprise's captain estimated that 1.5 hours (90 minutes) were required to get the converted aircraft into the air.Pueblo followed the North Korean vessels as ordered, but then stopped immediately outside North Korean waters. She was again fired upon, and a sailor, fireman Duane Hodges, was killed. The ship was finally boarded at 05:55 UTC (2:55 pm local) by men from a torpedo boat and a submarine chaser. Crew members had their hands tied and were blindfolded, beaten, and prodded with bayonets. Once Pueblo was in North Korean territorial waters, she was boarded again, this time by high-ranking North Korean officials.The first official confirmation that the ship was in North Korean hands came five days later, 28 January 1968. Two days earlier, a flight by a CIA A-12 Oxcart aircraft from the Project Black Shield squadron at Kadena, Okinawa, flown by pilot Jack Weeks, made three high-altitude, high-speed flights over North Korea. When the aircraft's films were processed in the United States, they showed Pueblo to be in the Wonsan harbor area surrounded by two North Korean vessels.There was dissent among government officials in the United States regarding the nation's response to the situation. Congressman Mendel Rivers suggested that President Johnson issue an ultimatum for the return of Pueblo under penalty of nuclear attack, while Senator Gale McGee said that the United States should wait for more information and not make \"spasmodic response[s] to aggravating incidents.\" According to Horace Busby, Special Assistant to President Johnson, the president's \"reaction to the hostage taking was to work very hard here to keep down any demands for retaliation or any other attacks upon North Koreans\", worried that rhetoric might result in the hostages being killed.On Wednesday, 24 January 1968, the day following the incident, after extensive cabinet meetings Washington decided that its initial response should be to:\n\nDeploy air and naval forces to the immediate area.\nMake reconnaissance flights over the location of the Pueblo.\nCall up military reserves and extend terms of military service.\nProtest the incident within the framework of the United Nations.\nHave President Johnson personally cable Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin.The Johnson Administration also considered a blockade of North Korean ports, air strikes on military targets and an attack across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.Although American officials at the time assumed that the seizure of Pueblo had been directed by the Soviet Union, declassified Soviet archives later showed that the Soviet leadership was caught by surprise, and became fearful of the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. Eastern Bloc ambassadors actively cautioned North Korea to exercise caution in the aftermath of the incident. Several documents suggest that the aggressive action may have been an attempt by North Korea to signal a tilt towards the Chinese Communist Party in the aftermath of the Sino-Soviet split in 1966. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nPueblo was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew was moved twice to prisoner-of-war (POW) camps. The crew members reported upon release that they were starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment turned worse when the North Koreans realized that crewmen were secretly giving them \"the finger\" in staged propaganda photos.Commander Lloyd M. Bucher was psychologically tortured, including being put through a mock firing squad in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to \"confess to his and the crew's transgression.\" Bucher wrote the confession since a \"confession\" by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said \"We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung\". (Bucher pronounced \"paean\" as \"pee on.\")Negotiations for the release of the crew took place at Panmunjom. At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the Pueblo negotiations, notes in his oral history:\n\nThe South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the Blue House Raid and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.\nHe also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive because of the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans:\n\nAs one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog ... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn't have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.\n\nEricson and George Newman, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out:\n\nWhat we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea's hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.\nFollowing an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that Pueblo had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement that it was done only to secure the release. On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) border with South Korea and crossing at the \"Bridge of No Return\", carrying with them the body of Fireman Duane D. Hodges, who was killed during the capture. Exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner, the captain led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the executive officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge.Bucher and all of the officers and crew subsequently appeared before a Navy Court of Inquiry. A court-martial was recommended for Bucher and the officer in charge of the research department, Lieutenant Steve Harris, for surrendering without a fight and for failing to destroy classified material, but Secretary of the Navy John Chafee, rejected the recommendation, stating, \"They have suffered enough.\" Commander Bucher was never found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement.In 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS Pueblo incident entitled Bucher: My Story. Bucher died in San Diego on 28 January 2004, at the age of 76. James Kell, a former sailor under his command, suggested that the injuries that Bucher suffered during his time in North Korea contributed to his death.USS Pueblo is still held by North Korea. In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of Nampo on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy James Kelly to Pyongyang. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard, Pueblo was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the Taedong River near the spot where the General Sherman incident is believed to have taken place. In late 2012, Pueblo was moved again to the Pothong River in Pyongyang, next to a new addition to the Fatherland Liberation War Museum.Today, Pueblo remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind USS Constitution (\"Old Ironsides\"). Pueblo is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in Tripoli.\n\n\n=== Breach of U.S. communications security ===\nReverse engineering of communications devices on Pueblo allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of Pueblo followed soon after US Navy warrant officer John Anthony Walker introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring.  It has been argued that the seizure of Pueblo was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker's information.After debriefing the released crew, the U.S. prepared a \u201cCryptographic Damage Assessment\u201d that was declassified in late 2006. The report concluded that, while the crew made a diligent effort to destroy sensitive material, most of them were not familiar with cryptographic equipment and publications, had not received training in their proper destruction, and that their efforts were not sufficient to prevent the North Koreans from recovering most of the sensitive material. The crew itself thought the North Koreans would be able to rebuild much of the equipment. \nCryptographic equipment onboard at the time of capture included \u201cone KL-47 for off-line encryption, two KW-7s for on-line encryption, three KWR-37s for receiving the Navy Operational Intelligence Broadcast, and four KG-14s which are used in conjunction with the KW-37 for receiving the Fleet Broadcasts.\u201d Additional tactical systems and one-time pads were captured, but they were considered of little significance since most messages sent using them would be of value for only a short time. \nThe ship's cryptographic personnel were subject to intense interrogation by what they felt were highly knowledgable electronics experts. When crew members attempted to withhold details, they were later confronted with pages from captured manuals and told to correct their earlier accounts. The report concluded that the information gained from the interrogations saved the North Koreans three to six months of effort, but that they would have eventually understood everything from the captured equipment and accompanying technical manuals alone. The crew members were also asked about many U.S. cryptographic systems that were not onboard the Pueblo, but only supplied superficial information. \nThe Pueblo carried key lists for January, February and March of 1968, but immediately after the Pueblo was captured, instructions were sent to other holders of those keys not to use them, so damage was limited. However it was discovered in the debriefing that the Pueblo had onboard superseded key lists for November and December 1967 which should have been destroyed by January 15, well before the Pueblo arrived on station, according to standing orders. The report considered the capture of the superseded keys for November and December the most damaging cryptographic loss. The capture of these keys likely allowed North Korea and its allies to read more than 117,000 classified messages sent during those months. The North Koreans would also have gained a thorough knowledge of the workings of the captured systems but that would only have been of use if additional key material was compromised in the future. The existence of the Walker spy ring was, of course, not known at the time of the report.\nThe report noted that \u201cthe North Koreans did not display any of the captured cryptographic material to the crew, except for some equipment diagrams, or otherwise publicize the material for propaganda purposes. When contrasted with the international publicity given to the capture of other highly classified Special Intelligence documents, the fact that this material was not displayed or publicized would indicate that they thoroughly understood its significance and the importance of concealing from the United States the details of the information they had acquired.\u201d\n\n\n=== In the communist camp ===\nDocuments released from National Archives of Romania suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume. Together with Blue House Raid, the Pueblo incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the Sino-Soviet split. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, Leonid Brezhnev publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the Pueblo incident.Furthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the Pueblo incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a 1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the similar treaty they had with China, the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.Given that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il-sung's intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to Alexei Kosygin on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \"increased defense preparations\" he had to attend to, sending instead his defense minister, Kim Ch'ang-bong, who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.\n\n\n== Timeline of negotiations ==\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the United States until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by U.S. Army Major General Gilbert H. Woodward. Timeline and quotations are taken from Matter of Accountability by Trevor Armbrister.\n\n\n== Tourist attraction ==\nPueblo is a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North Korea, since being moved to the Taedong River. Pueblo used to be anchored at the spot where it is believed the General Sherman incident took place in 1866. In late November 2012 Pueblo was moved from the Taedong river dock to a casement on the Pothong river next to the new Fatherland War of Liberation Museum. The ship was renovated and made open to tourists with an accompanying video of the North Korean perspective in late July 2013. To commemorate the anniversary of the Korean War, the ship had a new layer of paint added. Visitors are allowed to board the ship and see its secret code room and crew artifacts.The museum's position is  39\u00b002.26 N 125\u00b044.23 E\n\n\n== Offer to repatriate ==\nDuring an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate Pueblo to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, there has been no indication that the matter was brought up by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on his April 2018 visit.\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nFormer Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., in Washington, D.C., awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as \"extensive and shocking.\" The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgement from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPueblo has earned the following awards \u2013\n\nAs for the crew members, they did not receive full recognition for their involvement in the incident until decades later. In 1988, the military announced it would award Prisoner of War medals to those captured in the nation's conflicts. While thousands of American prisoners of war were awarded medals, the crew members of Pueblo did not receive them. Instead, they were classified as \"detainees\". It was not until Congress passed a law overturning this decision that the medals were awarded; the crew finally received the medals at San Diego in May 1990.\n\n\n== Representation in popular culture ==\nThe Pueblo incident was dramatically depicted in the critically acclaimed 1973 ABC Theater televised production Pueblo. Hal Holbrook starred as Captain Lloyd Bucher. The two-hour drama was nominated for three Emmy Awards, winning two.The 1968 Star Trek episode \"The Enterprise Incident\" was very loosely based upon the Pueblo incident. In the episode written by D. C. Fontana, Captain Kirk takes the Federation starship USS Enterprise, apparently without authorization, into enemy Romulan space.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1969 EC-121 shootdown incident\nKorean DMZ Conflict (1966\u20131969)\nList of museums in North KoreaOther conflicts:\n\nGulf of Tonkin incident\nHainan Island incident\nMayaguez incident\nUSS Liberty incidentGeneral:\n\nTechnical research ship\nList of hostage crises\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nNKIDP: Crisis and Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula: 1968\u20131969, A Critical Oral History\nUSS Pueblo Today usspueblo.org\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Pueblo Incident on YouTube \"The Pueblo Incident\"  briefing and analysis by the US Navy (1968)\nUSS Pueblo on YouTube YouTube video taken of and aboard the USS Pueblo in Korea\nThe short film The Pueblo Incident is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nOfficial website by former USS Pueblo crew members\nComplaint and court judgment from crew members' lawsuit against North Korea\n\"CNN.com obituary for Commander Lloyd M.

        "wiki": "The Tomb of King Tongmy\u014fng is a mausoleum located in near Ryongsan-ri, Ry\u014fkp'o-guy\u014fk, P'y\u014fng'yang, North Korea. One of the tombs is the royal tomb of Tongmy\u014fng (58\u201319 BC), the founder of the ancient Goguryeo kingdom, northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In total, there are 63 individual tombs of the period. The area around the Tongmyong contains at least fifteen known tombs believed to belong to various vassal lords. The tomb has achieved World Heritage status as part of the Complex of Goguryeo Tombs inscribed by UNESCO in 2004 under Criteria (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) covering an area of 233 hectares (580 acres) with a buffer zone of 1,701 hectares (4,200 acres). A unique feature of this and the other extant tombs in the area are its wall paintings depicting lotuses blossoming of that period indicative of Buddhism practiced in Korea (277 BC to 668 AD).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe sacred site was built when King Jangsu transferred his capital from Hwando Mountain Fortress to Pyongyang in 427 AD. The Royal Tomb of King Tongmyong is one of 63 tombs that exists in five zones of North Korea. The construction of all these tombs is dated to the 5th and 6th centuries. Its history is traced to Koguryo kingdom which existed between 277 BC to 668 AD, initially in Huanren, Liaoning Province in China. It was then shifted to Kungnae Castle in 3 AD in Ji'an, Jilin Province, of China and later moved to Mount Taesong area in Pyongyang, in 427 AD Korea. Its final location was to the present location in the Jangan Castle in the city center of Pyongyang. Kogyuro had five ancient tribes each with its own ancestral tomb observing rites celebrated during the tenth month of every year by performing the tongmyong (\"petition to the east\") which is the worship of a heavenly deity named Susin. Kiringul is situated 200 metres (660 ft) from the Yongmyong Temple in Moran Hill in Pyongyang City. It is a rectangular rock which is carved with the inscription \u201cUnicorn Lair\". Based on the discovery of the king's unicorn lair, archaeologists of the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences inferred that Pyongyang was the capital city of Ancient Korea and concurrently of the Koguryo Kingdom. In 1697, during the era of Sukjong of Joseon, the king endorsed a proposal to annually repair the Tomb of King Tongmyong.This and other tombs came to be publicised only after 1905 when Korea was occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese experts were instrumental in carrying out  scientific research and documentation of the tombs from 1911 to the 1940s. The original tombs had been ransacked by hunters of tombs and were found by the Japanese archaeologist during excavations carried out in 1941. After excavations it was renovated for political reasons.The UNESCO recognition in 2004 for the tombs was accorded under: Criterion i for the artistic elegance of the wall paintings; Criterion ii as it brings out the burial practice of Koguryo which had an influence on other cultures in the region including Japan; Criterion iii as the wall paintings represent the history, religious beliefs, and customs of the people; and Criterion iv for providing a burial typology.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nThe legend behind the King's birth is told in the third-century Chinese historical text Weil\u00fce, which is now mostly lost. According to the legend the chambermaid of the queen became pregnant when she was struck by a bolt of lightning. Then the king fearing that it was a supernatural event which could harm him got the baby thrown into the pigsty. However, the baby survived on account of the breath support provided by the pigs. The baby was then thrown into a horse stable where he survived. Then realizing that the child was a divinity the king ordered her mother to bring him up. He was given the name Tongmyong (Eastern Light) considering the events which led to his birth. He then went to build his own kingdom after overcoming all obstacles and attempts made on his life. He then declared himself the king of Puyo.\n\n\n== Political importance ==\n\nOne of two important rituals was instituted during the reign of Onjo of Baekje that involved Tongmyong; the first stressed the royal family's connections with the Puy\u014f peoples of Manchuria through the presentations of sacrifices at a shrine dedicated to Tongmyong.The era of the Kingdom of Goguryeo is of particular interest for the North Korean government. According to Lankov, in the early 1970s, Kim Jong-il reportedly pointed to \"a major shortcoming of North Korean archaeology: archaeologists had failed to locate the tomb of King Tongmy\u014fng\". In 1974, North Korean archaeologists produced the required tomb which was duly 'restored' and became a tourist attraction.  Although it was initially an authentic Goguryeo tomb known under the reference Jinpari tomb n\u00b010, there is no further evidence that this tomb is King Tongmy\u014fng's.The alleged discovery of the burial place of the founding monarch of the Kingdom of Goguryeo was followed by an extensive \"restoration\" during the 1980s.  The reconstruction process entailed the complete removal of all original buildings, structures, and monuments in order to create a new, white marble tomb. On 14 May 1993, the opening ceremony of the newly built tomb was attended by Kim Il Sung. Kim also wrote the calligraphy on the stele that is erected at the tomb and which has the name of the king of Puyo inscribed on it. King Tongmyong's tomb is of national heritage and its rebuilding and upkeep has been the responsibility of the state. Kim II Sung personally monitored the rebuilding of the tomb with funds provisioned by the state to make it \u201ca historical cultural heritage to be handed down to the generation to come.\u201dCoins of 10 North Korean won denomination were issued depicting the tomb of the king, in 2002.\n\n\n== Architecture and fittings ==\nThe mausoleum is a 11.5 m (38 ft)-high tumulus  bordered at the base with stone blocks. Each side of the tumulus is 34 m (112 ft) long. The tomb has a 22 m2 (240 sq ft) pyramidal inner chamber, a front chamber and a gallery made with stones. The chamber faces southwest. The renovated tomb of the king is the most prominent tomb and is one among the 20 tombs in Chinpari. The current tomb complex is quite modern.\nThe Royal Tomb of King Tongmyong and the Three Tombs of Kangso have mural paintings. The Tomb of King Tongmyong has Koguryo murals which are known for its rich color and tone. The wall paintings found in the tomb were of Buddhist themes, namely the lotus, and the animal depictions in the ceiling and walls of the tombs. The murals depict, realistically in a three-dimensional form, the daily life scenes of people such as women dancing, warriors  getting trained, birds flying in the sky covered with clouds, dragons, fish swimming in rivers, and wild life. The frescoes in the tomb depict lotuses in blossom with other religious ornamentation which bring out the traditional Buddhist ethos only and not the four traditional images of the constellations as in the Chinese tombs. This is inferred to represent the paradise in Buddhist religious parlance. The tomb has an inscription which substantiates the fact that it was a sacred site for tomyong festival rites. These consisted of the worship of mother earth and also livestock; the former is a south Asian rite while the latter is a shamanistic form of worship.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\nThe grounds include a large grassy area which was one of the venues for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students.\n\n\n=== Buddhist monastery ===\nThe Buddhist monastery, discovered in 1978, is located about 120 metres (390 ft) from the tomb and was inferred as the monastery built by King Changsu (413\u201391) after the capital was moved to Pyongyang in 427 AD. The inscriptions found here proclaim that Changsu was the chief monk who conducted the rites at the tomb and also in the Buddhist monastery nearby. It has three halls surrounding the walls of a pagoda which is similar to Japanese temples built in later years, suggesting that the Buddhism culture of Goguryeo has also permeated to Japan. Goguryeo itself has been influenced by the Chinese Buddhism of the Northern Dynasties.\n\n\n=== Chongr\u016dngsa Buddhist temple ===\nThe complex also houses the rebuilt Chongr\u016dngsa Buddhist temple, where funeral services were held for the deceased monarch. The temple, whose foundations were excavated in 1974, was rebuilt to mark the 2,300th anniversary of Tongmy\u014fng's birth.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Treasures of North Korea\nCapital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliographyCuhaj, George S.; Michael, Thomas (13 July 2012). 2013 Standard Catalog of World Coins 2001 to Date.

The building was constructed by the Japanese occupation government in 1923. It was used as the South P'y\u014fngan Provincial Products Exhibition. After his return to Korea after World War II, Kim Il-sung is alleged to have founded the Korean Worker's Party in this building on October 10, 1945, and here were held many of that group's first meetings. Thus, in October 1970 it was turned into a museum dedicated to his exploits. Nearby, and also part of the museum, is the modest house he inhabited during his early days as president of North Korea.The building's architecture is of the typical Japanese colonial style; it is blocky and formal, and built out of dark gray stone. The roof of the building is modeled after the Imperial Diet Building in Tokyo.The first floor features an exhibition of photos and artifacts, while the second floor is preserved in its original historic appearance. A conference hall, a lounge, and two office rooms used by Kim Il-sung are preserved.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in North Korea\nParty Foundation Day\nMonument to Party Founding\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParty Founding Museum picture album at Naenara",

          "Nothing to really see up close but the party symbol is impressive when viewed from a distance, weather permitting. We did get a very brief 'tour' from a worker.",
          "Just another monolith spreading the good word to the populace. Nothing of particular note from an artistic or beauty prospect but worth seeing.",
          "The monument symbolizes the creation of the KWP Korean Workers Party, some 50 years ago it was built, Great place to look at, located east side, as always we are met with the local guide to explain, translated thru our guides the history, and what it symbolizes, standing inside",
          "After visiting most of the other monuments in Pyongyang, I felt that there wasn't anything particularly special about this one as it lacked any particular significance. Nonetheless, it's a good opportunity to learn more about the history of the Korean Workers' Party from the",
          "The Monument to the Korean Workers Party is in the centre of Pyongyang and close to the Taedong River, it is anything but modest. It is a huge and assertive granite structure comprising three hands holding larger than life elements of a hammer which represents workers, sickle",
          "It's interesting but there are some great monuments in Pyongyang. The stylized hammer, suckle etc obviously is not a new theme. It is however impressively large, as most party monuments are in Pyongyang. The associared picture mueseum in the complex shows the Dear Leaders",
          "The way the monument was built provides lots of great angles for interesting photo opportunities. It's maybe not the most interesting place you'll visit, but it's still a nice stop.",
          "Nobody does giant monuments quite like the DPRK. The monument itself is impressive with the giant sickle, hammer and brush of the DPRK Workers Party visible from distance. When you step into the middle of the monument you realise the attention to detail with the inside ring",
          "The monument itself is impressive and reflects the history and the propaganda too. According to the published pictures, it certainly looks beautiful during the day. Unfortunately we visited it at night when it was poorly lit! So, guess how difficult it was to enjoy it! This was",
          "Great monument to the party has lots of hidden features another great photo opportunity . We visited as it was getting dark so would recommend a tripod for those long shutter speeds",
          "We went here and had a personalised tour and explanation of the symbolism of the site. We were then taken to a \"gallery\" and bookstore behind the monument. The monument like everything in DPRK is massive and overblown. If you have a clear day you can see all the way to the",
          "A grand monument. The guide did a good job in explaining the history and ideas behind the party. Also a good location for pictures.",
          "Constructed in 1995 consists of a set of murals reliefs that depict the history of the Workers Party of Korea. The huge sculpture of symbolic tools rises above the base and represents the farmers, the workers and the intellectuals. Quite a moving place for locals. Good for",
          "The three huge symbols of the hammer, sickle and writing brush represent the workers, peasant farmers and intellectuals. The monument stands a full 50 meters tall. Incredibly impressive. You can get some great photo shots at sunrise with the monument silhouetted against the",
          "I've marked this as an average attraction because you go there, you see it and how big it is, a local guide says a few words and that's about it.",
          "As with so many North Korean monuments, this is impressive from an artistic point of view. Hammer for workers, sickle for farmers and brush for artists.",
          "The detail is incredible. There are murals around the inside, and the views up to the statues of the two great leaders are fantastic.",
          "We arrived in the afternoon, it was without any people, just for us. Amazing to stand into a place with so much history",
          "I found this impressive and not a bad piece of design which is really worth a look. And you get to have a bit of a walk.",
          "A very powerful monument that is hard to miss when in Pyongyang and also has a interesting story behind it. Go when it gets dark and see it lighted up and it gives a very powerful impression",
          "This place is great at night, far more impressive than in the day. A little phallic really and for that reason odd. All in all though one of those- you should not miss sights of Pyongyang. Not that you will anyway as you will eventually be dragged there by your tour leader.",
          "If you visit Pyongyang, you WILL be taken to visit this monument (and many others); they are very proud of their Party",
          "not rich in details but impressive. Allmost frightening when you know the country and leadership....",
          "If you can, try to take a picture of this monument at night. Like all monuments in the Pyongyang, it is nicely lit at night. Bring a tripod if you have a decent camera. Lots of great night picture opportunities.",
          "There's the axe meaning hard labours. The scythe is about the farmers, and the brush is about education. The North Korean sees this as their beliefs, the 3 must unified to work together as a country. Others sees this as a symbol of how they are being 'controlled'-forced hard",
          "As a monument its iconic to the DPRK but less so to us foreigners. Enjoy the city planning however, the fact that the apartment buildings all focus the attention down onto the monument. Noticeable how the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il look down onto the monument,",
          "nice monument and you can also get a good view/picture of the 105 storey Ryugyong Hotel. you will see this monument on many stamps, posters, and the money.",
          "This monument is aligned with a large plaza that offers an impressive view across the river... It is more impressive than both the Triumphant Arch and Reunification Arch... It is about a 10min walk to the Juche Tower and is in my mind the most impressive and most original",
          "A very modern monument. It is not as impressive as other monuments but still big. I found the apartment buildings surrounding the monument much more interesting because it allowed a much closer view of how people lived. None of us was able to identify the third figure in the",
          "Like every sculpture in North Korea, the details are very well executed! The guide's informations were very valuable in order to understand the structure of the north koreans.",
          "This is the monument to visit in Pyongyang. It's a lot bigger than any picture you've seen of it. The three hands hold symbols of the three major parts of society as the DPRK sees them. Inside the monument are murals detailing the history of the DPRK.",
          "It's very incredible. The three parts of society (workers, farmers, intellectuals) are gathered here. Not only there are the three hand holding stuff but also inside it is carve scenes from the glorious past. Unmissable.",
          "Nice monument to visit, very large and a nice little park behind the monument. Also theres a gift shop and art studio in the buildings in the back.",
          "Another \"must-see\" of Pyongyang. You will get used to the constant propaganda information. Try to get to the River.",
          "You can see this monument from the river, and it looks rather impressive. Getting closer you can see its true size, there are also several bronze reliefs on the inside, as the three hands and symbols are surrounded by a circle, which represents the unity. In the evening it is",
          "Idea is brilliant (in USSR we had the idea of collaboration between labors and farmers, in PDRK - they added intelligence workers to this), technical implementation - a bit depressive, but it inspires - to stay in the middle of the monument and watch to the skies. The square",
          "This monument tells the total story of the North Korean people. The hammer is what the government uses to keep them in place,the scythe is what the people use to cut the grass and everything else as they have no power tools, the brush is just a symbol of education as the",
          "This statue was built commemorating the Korean Workers Party. It was built aligned with the new hotel of doom(the pyramid looking building). You could have a pleasant open view of city.",
          "Our guides were very proud of this monument, since it is the only one in the world commemorating the Korean Workers Party. The hammer represents the laborers. The cycle represents farmers. And the brush represents writing, which is a symbol of Korean intellect and academics.",
          "I have to be honest, this is a good monument with great views of the big statues on the hill and the Hotel of Doom in the background. A local guide popped up to tell us all about it which was nice!",
          "Along with the traditional Communist hammer and sickle there is also a brush which is used for writing. The brush shows the importance of education to the Korean people. This is a unique monument that can only be seen in the DPRK."

This stadium held the annual Kyung-Pyong Football Match between Kyungsung FC and Pyongyang FC during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\nAfter the division of Korea, it was used as a venue for speeches by politicians. On 14 October 1945, it was the site of Kim Il-sung's victory speech after the liberation of Pyongyang, called \"Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea.\"Most of the stadium was destroyed during the 1950-1953 Korean War, mostly by U.S. aerial bombing of the capital city during those years. Rebuilt in 1969, it was then called Moranbong Stadium, but in April 1982 it was renovated and renamed in honour of Kim Il-sung. It is used mainly for football matches, and hosted the mass games until the 1990s (now held in Rungnado May Day Stadium).\n\n\n== Present day ==\nToday, the Kim Il-sung stadium is used as the home ground for the North Korea national football team, the North Korea women's national football team and the Pyongyang City Sports Club and Kigwancha Sports Club.\nIn 2008, on two occasions, a 2010 World Cup qualifying match between North and South Korea, due to be played in Pyongyang, had to be moved to Shanghai when authorities in the North refused to allow the South Korean national anthem to be played in Kim Il-sung Stadium, or the flag of South Korea to be flown, as North and South Korea have never granted each other formal diplomatic recognition.The start and finish of the annual Pyongyang Marathon occurs at Kim Il-sung Stadium.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of football stadiums in North Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKim Il Sung stadium.

        "wiki": "The Rungrado 1st of May Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium on Rungra Island, Pyongyang, North Korea. It opened on 1 May 1989, with its first major event being the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. It is the largest stadium in the world by seating capacity. The site occupies an area of 20.7 hectares (51 acres).\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe stadium is currently used for football matches, a few athletics events, and most often for the mass games of the Arirang Festival.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe stadium's scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and resembles a magnolia blossom. It hosts events on a main pitch covering 22,500 m2 (242,000 sq ft). Its total floor space is over 207,000 m2 (2,230,000 sq ft) across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more than 60 m (200 ft) above the ground.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the 1988 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Seoul, North Korea doubled down its efforts to present itself as the legitimate Korean state.

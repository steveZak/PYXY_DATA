        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%. Ho Chi Minh City's largest minority ethnic group are the Chinese (Hoa) with 5.78%.

The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese. Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam. Although the city takes up just 0.6% of the country's land area, it contains 8.34% of the population of Vietnam, 20.2% of its GDP, 27.9% of industrial output and 34.9% of the FDI projects in the country in 2005.

The GDP adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) reached $71.5 billion, or about $10,870 per capita (approximately three times higher than the country's average). The city's Industrial Product Value was $6.4 billion, equivalent to 30% of the value of the entire nation. Export \u2013 Import Turnover through HCMC ports accounted for $36 billion, or 40% of the national total, of which export revenue reached $18.3 billion (40% of Vietnam's total export revenues). In 2007, Ho Chi Minh City's contribution to the annual revenues in the national budget increased by 30 percent, accounting for about 20.5 percent of total revenues.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others. Though the former schools are all public, private education is also available in Ho Chi Minh City. High school consists of grade 10\u201312 (sophomore, junior, and senior).\n\n\n==== List of Public High schools in Ho Chi Minh City ====\nVNUHCM High School for the Gifted\nL\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted\nTr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted\nNguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School\nNguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School\nB\u00f9i Th\u1ecb Xu\u00e2n High School\nPh\u00fa Nhu\u1eadn High School\nB\u00ecnh Ph\u00fa High School\nGia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School\nM\u1ea1c \u0110\u0129nh Chi High School\nL\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School\nNguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea7u High School\nNguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Hu\u00e2n High School\nMarie Curie High School\nV\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School\nChu V\u0103n An High School\nTr\u01b0ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng High School\nL\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh High School\nTr\u1ea7n Khai Nguy\u00ean High School\nNguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i High School\nNguy\u1ec5n Khuy\u1ebfn High School\nNguy\u1ec5n Du High School\nNguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Tr\u1ee9 High School\nNguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh High School\nNguyen Thai Binh High School\nThu Duc High School\n\n\n==== List of Private High schools ====\nQuang Trung Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 High School\nNguy\u1ec5n Khuy\u1ebfn High School\nTr\u00ed \u0110\u1ee9c High School\nNg\u00f4 Th\u1eddi Nhi\u1ec7m High School\nKhai Tr\u00ed High School\nTr\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0129nh K\u00fd High School\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nHigher education in Ho Chi Minh City is a burgeoning industry; the city boasts over 80 universities and colleges with a total of over 400,000 students. Notable universities include Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM), with 50,000 students distributed among six schools; The University of Technology (Vietnamese: \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc B\u00e1ch khoa, formerly Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd National Center of Technology); The University of Sciences (formerly Saigon College of Sciences); The University of Social Sciences and Humanities (formerly Saigon College of Letters); The International University; The University of Economics and Law; and the newly established University of Information Technology.\nSome other important higher education establishments include HCMC University of Pedagogy, University of Economics, University of Architecture, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine Nong Lam University (formerly University of Agriculture and Forestry), University of Law, University of Technical Education, University of Banking, University of Industry, Open University, University of Sports and Physical Education, University of Fine Arts, University of Culture, the Conservatory of Music, the Saigon Institute of Technology, V\u0103n Lang University, Saigon University and Hoa Sen University.\nIn addition to the above public universities, Ho Chi Minh City is also home to several private universities. One of the most notable is RMIT International University Vietnam, a campus of Australian public research RMIT University with an enrollment of about 6,000 students. Tuition at RMIT is about US$40,000 for an entire course of study. Other private universities include The Saigon International University (or SIU) is another private university run by the Group of Asian International Education. Enrollment at SIU averages about 12,000 students Depending on the type of program, tuition at SIU costs US$5,000\u20136,000 per year.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\n\nDue to its history, artworks have generally been inspired by both Western and Eastern styles.\nFamous art locations in Ho Chi Minh City include Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts, and various art galleries located on Nam Ky Khoi Nghia street, Tran Phu street, and Bui Vien street.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe city's media is the most developed in the country. At present, there are seven daily newspapers: Sai Gon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon), and its Vietnamese, investment and finance, sports, evening and weekly editions; Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb (Youth), the highest circulation newspaper in Vietnam; Thanh Nien (Young People), the second largest circulation in the south of Vietnam; Nguoi Lao Dong (Labourer); The Thao (Sports); Phap Luat (Law) and The Saigon Times Daily, an English-language newspaper as well as more than 30 other newspapers and magazines. The city has hundreds of printing and publishing houses, many bookstores and a widespread network of public and school libraries; the city's General Library houses over 1.5 million books. Locally based Ho Chi Minh City Television (HTV) is the second largest television network in the nation, just behind the national Vietnam Television (VTV), broadcasting 24/7 on 7 different channels (using analog and digital technology). Many major international TV channels are provided through two cable networks (SCTV and HTVC), with over one million subscribers. The Voice of Ho Chi Minh City is the largest radio station in south Vietnam.Internet coverage, especially through ADSL connections, is rapidly expanding, with over 2,200,000 subscribers and around 5.5 million frequent users. Internet service providers (ISPs) operating in Ho Chi Minh City include the Vietnam Data Communication Company (VDC), Corporation for Finance and Promoting Technology (FPT), Netnam Company, Saigon Post and Telecommunications Services Corporation (Saigon Postel Corporation, SPT) and Viettel Company. The city has more than two million fixed telephones and about fifteen million cellular phones (the latter growing annually by 20%). Mobile phone service is provided by a number of companies, including Viettel Mobile, MobiFone, VinaPhone, and Vietnam Mobile.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nAs of 2005, Ho Chi Minh City was home to 91 football fields, 86 swimming pools, 256 gyms. The largest stadium in the city is the 25,000-seat Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Stadium, located on \u0110\u00e0o Duy T\u1eeb Street, in Ward 6 of District 10. The next largest is Army Stadium, located near Tan Son Nhat Airport in T\u00e2n B\u00ecnh district. Army Stadium was of the venues for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup finals. As well as being a sporting venue, it is also the site of a music school. Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd Racecourse, another notable sporting venue established during colonial times, is the only racetrack in Vietnam. The city's Department of Physical Education and Sports also manages a number of clubs, including Phan Dinh Phung, Thanh Da, and Yet Kieu.\nHo Chi Minh City is home to a number of association football clubs. One of the city's largest clubs, Ho Chi Minh City F.C., is based at Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Stadium. As C\u1ea3ng S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, they were four-time champions of Vietnam's V.League 1 (in 1986, 1993\u201394, 1997, and 2001\u201302). The team currently plays in Vietnam's First Division. Navibank Saigon F.C., founded as Qu\u00e2n Khu 4, also based at Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Stadium, emerged as champions of the First Division in the 2008 season, and were promoted to the V-League in 2009. The city's police department also fielded a football team in the 1990s, C\u00f4ng An Th\u00e0nh Ph\u1ed1, which won the V-League championship in 1995. Celebrated striker L\u00ea Hu\u1ef3nh \u0110\u1ee9c, now manager of SHB \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng F.C., played for the Police F.C. from 1995 to 2000, setting a league record of 25 goals in the 1996 season.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The War Remnants Museum (Vietnamese: B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng ch\u1ee9ng t\u00edch chi\u1ebfn tranh) is a war museum at 28 Vo Van Tan, in District 3, Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam. It contains exhibits relating to the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== History ==\nOperated by the Vietnamese government, an earlier version of this museum opened on September 4, 1975, as the Exhibition House for US and Puppet Crimes (Vietnamese: Nh\u00e0 tr\u01b0ng b\u00e0y t\u1ed9i \u00e1c M\u1ef9-ng\u1ee5y). It was located in the former United States Information Agency building. The exhibition was not the first of its kind for the North Vietnamese side, but rather followed a tradition of such exhibitions exposing war crimes, first those of the French and then those of the Americans, who had operated in the country as early as 1954.In 1990, the name was changed to Exhibition House for Crimes of War and Aggression (Nh\u00e0 tr\u01b0ng b\u00e0y t\u1ed9i \u00e1c chi\u1ebfn tranh x\u00e2m l\u01b0\u1ee3c), dropping both \"U.S.\" and \"Puppet.\" In 1995, following the normalization of diplomatic relations with the United States and end of the US embargo a year before, the references to \"war crimes\" and \"aggression\" were dropped from the museum's title as well; it became the War Remnants Museum.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum comprises a series of themed rooms in several buildings, with period military equipment placed within a walled yard. The military equipment includes a UH-1 \"Huey\" helicopter, an F-5A fighter, a BLU-82 \"Daisy Cutter\" bomb, M48 Patton tank, an A-1 Skyraider attack bomber, and an A-37 Dragonfly attack bomber. There are a number of pieces of unexploded ordnance stored in the corner of the yard, with their charges and/or fuses removed.\nOne building reproduces the \"tiger cages\" in which the South Vietnamese government kept political prisoners. Other exhibits include graphic photography, accompanied by a short text in English, Vietnamese and Japanese, covering the effects of Agent Orange and other chemical defoliant sprays, the use of napalm and phosphorus bombs, and war atrocities such as the My Lai massacre. The photographic display includes work by Vietnam War photojournalist Bunyo Ishikawa that he donated to the museum in 1998. Curiosities include a guillotine used by the French and South Vietnamese to execute prisoners, the last time being in 1960, and three jars of preserved human fetuses deformed by exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, contained in the defoliant Agent Orange.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe War Remnants Museum is currently one of the most popular museums in Vietnam, attracting approximately half a million visitors every year. According to the museum's own estimates, about two-thirds of these are foreigners.  \nUS anthropologist Christina Schwenkel wrote the museum attempts to convey historical truths with 'self-representation', presenting images and other features without contextualising them as other museums do. Museum curators are described as being privy to the fact that knowledge about the Vietnam War and the interests of the Vietnamese is not typically known in other nations.\nAn analysis of the impression books (which the tourists may use to leave their comments in at the exit) revealed that the museum's visitors used to be mostly Europeans and North Americans before 2005, but that its audience became much more varied after Vietnam dropped their visa requirement for ASEAN countries that year. The impression books also record mixed responses to the museum. Others simply praised Vietnam, while some Americans harshly criticized the museum for its \"propaganda\" and \"glorification of [their] victory\". Broadening interests have expanded from other countries as well, including visits from tourists from Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and others expanding to see the museum.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoutheastern Armed Forces Museum Military Zone 7\nVietnam People's Air Force Museum, Ho Chi Minh City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPictures of the Vietnam War Remnants Museum\nWar Remnants Museum website",

      "name": "Cu Chi Tunnel",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The tunnels of C\u1ee7 Chi are an immense network of connecting tunnels located in the C\u1ee7 Chi District of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam, and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the Vietnam War, and were the Viet Cong's base of operations for the T\u1ebft Offensive in 1968.\nThe tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as hiding spots during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces, and helped to counter the growing American military effort.\n\n\n== Life in tunnels ==\nAmerican soldiers used the term \"Black Echo\" to describe the conditions within the tunnels. For the Viet Cong, life in the tunnels was difficult. Air, food and water were scarce, and the tunnels were infested with ants, venomous centipedes, snakes, scorpions, spiders, and rodents. Most of the time, soldiers would spend the day in the tunnels working or resting and come out only at night to scavenge for supplies, tend their crops, or engage the enemy in battle. Sometimes, during periods of heavy bombing or American troop movement, they would be forced to remain underground for many days at a time. Sickness was rampant among the people living in the tunnels, especially malaria, which was the second largest cause of death next to battle wounds. A captured Viet Cong report suggests that at any given time, half of a unit of the People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) unit had malaria and that \"one-hundred percent had intestinal parasites of significance.\"\n\n\n== U.S. campaigns against tunnels ==\n\nThe tunnels of C\u1ee7 Chi were noticed by U.S. officials, who recognized the advantages that the Viet Cong held with the tunnels and so launched several major campaigns to search out and destroy the tunnel system. Among the most important were Operation Crimp and Operation Cedar Falls.\nOperation Crimp began on January 7, 1966, with B-52 bombers dropping 30-ton loads of high explosive onto the region of C\u1ee7 Chi, effectively turning the once lush jungle into a pockmarked moonscape. Eight thousand troops from the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment combed the region looking for any clues of PLAF activity.\n\nThe operation did not bring about the desired success. For instance, when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. No one was usually sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two most common responses in dealing with a tunnel opening would be to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open or to toss a few grenades down the hole and \"crimp\" off the opening. Those approaches proved ineffective because of the design of the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.\nHowever, an Australian specialist engineering troop, 3 Field Troop, under the command of Captain Alexander \"Sandy\" MacGregor ventured into the tunnels, which they searched exhaustively for four days, l and found ammunition, radio equipment, medical supplies, food, and signs of considerable Viet Cong presence. One of their number, Corporal Robert \"Bob\" Bowtell, died when he became trapped in a tunnel that turned out to  be a dead end. However the Australians pressed on and revealed for the first time the immense military significance of the tunnels.  At an international press conference in Saigon shortly after Operation Crimp, MacGregor referred to his men as \"tunnel ferrets. \" An American journalist who had never heard of ferrets, used the term \"tunnel rat,\" and it stuck. After his troop's discoveries in C\u1ee7 Chi, MacGregor was awarded a Military Cross.From its mistakes and the Australians' discoveries, U.S. command realized that it needed a new way to approach the dilemma of the tunnels. A general order was issued by General Williamson, the Allied Forces Commander in South Vietnam, to all Allied forces that tunnels had to be properly searched whenever they were discovered. It began training an elite group of volunteers in the art of tunnel warfare, armed only with a handgun, a knife, a flashlight, and a piece of string. The specialists, commonly known as \"tunnel rats\", would enter a tunnel by themselves and travel inch-by-inch cautiously looking ahead for booby traps or cornered PLAF. There was no real doctrine for the approach, and despite some very hard work in some sectors of the Army and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, to provide some sort of training and resources, it was primarily a new approach that the units trained, equipped, and planned for themselves.\nDespite the revamped effort at fighting the enemy on their own terms, U.S. operations remained insufficient at eliminating the tunnels completely. In 1967, General William Westmoreland tried to launch a larger assault on C\u1ee7 Chi and the Iron Triangle. Called Operation Cedar Falls, it was similar to the previous Operation Crimp but was on a larger scale with 30,000 troops, instead of 8,000. On January 18, tunnel rats from the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division uncovered the Viet Cong district headquarters of C\u1ee7 Chi, containing half a million documents concerning all types of military strategy. Among the documents were maps of U.S. bases, detailed accounts of PLAF movement from Cambodia into Vietnam, lists of political sympathizers, and even plans for a failed assassination attempt on Robert McNamara.\nBy 1969, B-52s were freed from bombing North Vietnam and started \"carpet bombing\" C\u1ee7 Chi and the rest of the Iron Triangle. Towards the end of the war, the tunnels were so heavily bombed that some portions actually caved in, and other sections were exposed. But by then, they had succeeded in protecting the local North Vietnamese units and letting them \"survive to fight another day.\"\nThroughout the war, the tunnels in and around C\u1ee7 Chi proved to be a source of frustration for the U.S. military in Saigon. The Viet Cong had been so well entrenched in the area by 1965 that it was in the unique position of being able to control where and when battles would take place. By helping to covertly move supplies and house troops, the tunnels of C\u1ee7 Chi allowed North Vietnamese fighters in their area of South Vietnam to survive, help prolong the war and increase U.S. costs and casualties until the eventual withdrawal in 1972, and the final defeat of South Vietnam in 1975.\n\n\n== Tourist destinations ==\n\nThe 75-mile (121 km)-long complex of tunnels at C\u1ee7 Chi has been preserved by the government of Vietnam, and turned into a war memorial park with two different tunnel display sites, Ben Dinh and Ben Duoc. The tunnels are a popular tourist attraction in Vietnam, and visitors are invited to crawl around in the safer parts of the tunnel system. The Ben Duoc site contains part of the original tunnel system, and the Ben Dinh site, closer to Saigon, has tunnel reconstructions and some tunnels have been made larger to accommodate tourists. In both sites, low-power lights have been installed in the tunnels to make traveling through them easier, and both sites have displays of the different types of booby traps that were used. Underground conference rooms in which campaigns such as the T\u1ebft Offensive were planned in 1968 have been restored, and visitors may enjoy a simple meal of food that Viet Cong fighters would have eaten.Above-ground attractions include caged monkeys, vendors selling souvenirs, and a shooting range, where visitors can fire a number of assault rifles, such as the M16 rifle or AK-47, or a general-purpose machine guns, such as the M60.\n\n\n== See also ==\nV\u1ecbnh M\u1ed1c tunnels\nC\u1ee7 Chi Base Camp\nC\u1ee7 Chi Tunnels Website\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Tunnels of Cu Chi, Tom Mangold & John Penycate, Berkley Books, New York, 1986, ISBN 0-425-08951-7\nTunnel Rats by Jimmy Thomson with Sandy MacGregor (Allen & Unwin, Australia, 2011)(Website)\nA Sappers War by Jimmy Thomson with Sandy MacGregor (Allen & Unwin, Australia, 2012)\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotos of Cu Chi and Vietnamese Tunnels from mondesouterrain.fr\nCu Chi Tunnels Travel Guide",

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%. Ho Chi Minh City's largest minority ethnic group are the Chinese (Hoa) with 5.78%. Cholon \u2013 in District 5 and parts of Districts 6, 10 and 11 \u2013 is home to the largest Chinese community in Vietnam. The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese. Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam. Although the city takes up just 0.6% of the country's land area, it contains 8.34% of the population of Vietnam, 20.2% of its GDP, 27.9% of industrial output and 34.9% of the FDI projects in the country in 2005. In 2005, the city had 4,344,000 labourers, of whom 130,000 are over the labour age norm (in Vietnam, 60 for male and 55 for female workers). In 2009, GDP per capita reached $2,800, compared to the country's average level of $1,042.\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nAs of June 2006, the city has been home to three export processing zones and twelve industrial parks. Ho Chi Minh City is the leading recipient of foreign direct investment in Vietnam, with 2,530 FDI projects worth $16.6 billion at the end of 2007. In 2007, the city received over 400 FDI projects worth $3 billion.\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\nIn 2007, the city's GDP was estimated at $14.3 billion, or about $2,180 per capita, up 12.6 percent from 2006 and accounting for 20% of the country's GDP. The GDP adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) reached $71.5 billion, or about $10,870 per capita (approximately three times higher than the country's average). The city's Industrial Product Value was $6.4 billion, equivalent to 30% of the value of the entire nation. Export \u2013 Import Turnover through HCMC ports accounted for $36 billion, or 40% of the national total, of which export revenue reached $18.3 billion (40% of Vietnam's total export revenues). In 2007, Ho Chi Minh City's contribution to the annual revenues in the national budget increased by 30 percent, accounting for about 20.5 percent of total revenues. The consumption demand of Ho Chi Minh City is higher than other Vietnamese provinces and municipalities and 1.5 times higher than that of Hanoi.\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\nIn 2008, it attracted $8.5 billion in FDI. In 2010, the city's GDP was estimated at $20.902 billion, or about $2,800 per capita, up 11.8 percent from 2009.\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\nBy the end of 2012, the city's GDP was estimated around $28,595 billion, or about $3,700 per capita, up 9.2 percent from 2011. Total trade (export and import) reached $47.7 billion, with export at $21.57 billion and import $26.14 billion.\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\nIn 2013, GDP of the city grew 7.6% by Q1, 8.1% by Q2, and 10.3% by the end of Q3.

The state-owned sector makes up 33.3% of the economy, the private sector 4.6%, and the remainder in foreign investment. Concerning its economic structure, the service sector accounts for 51.1%, industry and construction account for 47.7% and forestry, agriculture and others make up just 1.2%.\nQuang Trung Software Park is a software park situated in District 12. The park is approximately 15 km (9 mi) from downtown Ho Chi Minh City and hosts software enterprises as well as dot.com companies. The park also includes a software training school. Dot.com investors here are supplied with other facilities and services such as residences and high-speed access to the internet as well as favourable taxation. Together with the Hi-Tech Park in District 9, and the 32 ha. software park inside Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone in District 7 of the city, Ho Chi Minh City aims to become an important hi-tech city in the country and the South-East Asia region.\nThis park helps the city in particular and Vietnam in general to become an outsourcing location for other enterprises in developed countries, as India has done. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, and also in construction, building materials and agricultural products. Additionally, crude oil is a popular economic base in the city. Investors are still pouring money into the city. Total local private investment was 160 billion \u0111\u1ed3ng (US$7.5 million) with 18,500 newly founded companies. Investment trends to high technology, services and real estate projects.As of June 2006, the city had three export processing zones and twelve industrial parks, in addition to Quang Trung Software Park and Ho Chi Minh City hi-tech park. Intel has invested about 1 billion dollars in a factory in the city. More than fifty banks with hundreds of branches and about 20 insurance companies are also located inside the city. The Stock Exchange, the first stock exchange in Vietnam, was opened in 2001. There are 171 medium and large-scale markets as well as several supermarket chains, shopping malls, and fashion and beauty centres.Some of the larger shopping malls and plazas opened recently include:\n\nMaximark \u2013 Multiple locations (District 10, and Tan Binh District)\nSatramart \u2013 460 3/2 Street, Ward 12, District 10\nAuchan (2016) \u2013 Multiple locations (District 10, and Go Vap District)\nLotte Mart \u2013 Multiple locations (District 7, District 11, and Tan Binh District)\nAEON Mall Tan Phu Celadon (2014) \u2013 Multiple locations (Binh Tan District, and Tan Phu District)\nSC VivoCity (2015) \u2013 1058 Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard, Tan Phong Ward, District 7\nZen Plaza (1995) \u2013 54\u201356 Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i St, District 1\nSaigon Centre (1997) \u2013 65 L\u00ea L\u1ee3i Blvd, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nDiamond Plaza (1999) \u2013 34 Le Duan Blvd, District 1\nBig C (2002) \u2013 Multiple locations (District 10, Binh Tan District, Go Vap District, Phu Nhuan District, and Tan Phu District)\nMETRO Cash & Carry/Mega Market \u2013 Multiple locations (District 2, District 6, and District 12)\nCrescent Mall \u2013 Phu My Hung, District 7\nParkson (2005\u20132009) \u2013 Multiple locations (District 1, District 2, District 5, District 7, District 11, and Tan Binh District)\nSaigon Paragon (2009) \u2013 3 Nguy\u1ec5n L\u01b0\u01a1ng B\u1eb1ng St, Tan Phu Ward, District 7\nNowZone (2009) \u2013 235 Nguyen Van Cu Ave, Nguyen Cu Trinh Ward, District 1\nKumho Asiana Plaza (2010) \u2013 39 Le Duan Blvd, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nVincom Centre (2010) \u2013 70\u201372 L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n St, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nUnion Square \u2013 171 L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n st, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nVincom Mega Mall (2016) \u2013 S\u1ed1 161 Xa L\u1ed9 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, P.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants).

As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020.

Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99.

Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants).

As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020.

Together with the Hi-Tech Park in District 9, and the 32 ha. software park inside Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone in District 7 of the city, Ho Chi Minh City aims to become an important hi-tech city in the country and the South-East Asia region.\nThis park helps the city in particular and Vietnam in general to become an outsourcing location for other enterprises in developed countries, as India has done. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, and also in construction, building materials and agricultural products. Additionally, crude oil is a popular economic base in the city. Investors are still pouring money into the city.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics.

        "wiki": "Bitexco Financial Tower (Vietnamese: Th\u00e1p T\u00e0i ch\u00ednh Bitexco) is a skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At its completion in 2010, it became the tallest building in Vietnam and kept this status until January 2011, when it was surpassed by Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower.  With 68 floors above ground and three basements, the building has a height of 262.5 metres (861 ft), making it the second tallest building in the city, fifth tallest in Vietnam, and the 263rd tallest in the world, as of the beginning of 2018.The tower is owned by Bitexco Group, a Vietnamese multi-industry corporation, with a focus on real estate development. The building also houses the Ho Chi Minh City office of Bitexco Group, while its headquarters are in Hanoi.The tower was designed by Carlos Zapata, Design Principal and Founder of Carlos Zapata Studio, with French company AREP as architect of record.  Designer Zapata, who was born in Venezuela but is based in New York City, drew inspiration for this skyscraper's unique shape from Vietnam's national flower, the Lotus.The tower was officially inaugurated on 31 October 2010.  In 2013, CNN.com named the Bitexco Financial Tower one of the 25 Great Skyscraper Icons of Construction. And in 2015, Thrillist.com named the Bitexco Financial Tower the #2 Coolest Skyscraper in the World.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was held in September 2005. Two years later, in June 2007, construction of the tower started. The tower topped out in mid-2010 and had its inauguration ceremony on 31 October 2010.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nAmongst other international awards and recognitions, on 30 November 2011, Bitexco Financial Tower received the \"Excellence in structure engineering awards 2011\" in the \"International structure over $100 million\" category. NCSEA.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nBitexco Financial Tower is a mixed use project which includes office, retail, F&B and entertainment space. The tower has around 38,000 square metres of office space, from 7th to 65th floors, and a five-storey retail podium, Icon68, including food court and seven screen multiplex cinema with around 10,000 square metres from Ground to 4th Floors. At Floor 49, at height around 178 metres, there is an observation deck open to the public.\nVietnam's first non-rooftop helipad is on the 52nd floor of the Bitexco Financial Tower. The helipad extends 22 meters out from the main structure. It is strong enough to carry a helicopter up to 3 tons of weight.\n\n\n=== Key design features ===\nGrand Atrium Lobby\nWall & Fa\u00e7ade systemThe glass from Belgium was purchased and shipped to China for manufacturing.  Once in China the low iron heat strengthened glass was cut into 6,000 individual panels.  Each panel is double glazed with the outside layer being 8 mm thick and internal air space of 12 mm and an internal panel of 8 mm.  Finally the glass was shipped to Ho Chi Minh City and the panels were installed as the building grew higher. Each of the 6,000 sleek glass panels enveloping the Bitexco Financial Tower is individually cut to unique specifications because each floor is unique, giving the building its eye-catching shape.\n\nHelipadLocated on the southern side of the Bitexco Financial Tower, the helipad cantilevers from the 52nd floor and resembles a blossoming lotus bud.Constructed from more than 250 tons of structural steel and requiring 4,000 ultra-strong bolts to hold it together, the helipad took almost a year to plan, build and coordinate before it could be hoisted to its place at height around 191 meters.  Its installation alone took about two months.\nMost of the materials used to construct the helipad were purchased from Europe and South Korea and the manufacturing took place in Bu Gang, a city near Seoul. Once the fabrication of the helipad was completed, it was shipped to Vietnam.\nTo ensure proper assembly, the entire helipad was pre-assembled on the ground of a factory in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province in Vietnam \u2013 a process that took about three weeks.\nWhen the helipad was ready to be lifted into place, the roads surrounding the southern face of the Bitexco Financial Tower were closed for safety reasons and the helipad was transported into the centre of District 1.  The massive yet delicate operation of lifting the helipad began.  It was lifted in parts and attached to the 52nd storey of the Bitexco Financial Tower, 191 meters above Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nVertical TransportationBitexco Financial Tower operates Otis double-deck elevators with specialised Compass System which is the most modern and advanced elevator system in Vietnam. With speed up to 7 meters per second, it was the fastest lift system in South East Asia at the time of installation. There are 3 separate elevator zones servicing the tower with 14 passenger and 2 service lifts, plus further lifts to serve the retail and parking areas.\n\nSaigon Skydeck on 49th floorThe Saigon Skydeck soft opened for visitors from overseas and domestically on 1 January 2011, officially opening in July that same year. The observation deck offers 360-degree panoramic views of Ho Chi Minh City, guest facilities and a gift shop. Saigon Skydeck opens daily and a ticket costs around $10.\n\n\n=== Floor plan ===\nThe following is the breakdown of floors.\n\n\n== Office demand in Ho Chi Minh City ==\nDue to the rapid economic growth of Saigon in particular and dynamic economic development of Vietnam in general, the construction of office buildings in Ho Chi Minh City has been rapid. Bitexco Financial Tower has fulfilled the need for international standard office space in this city. The unit price of prime grade offices now in Saigon can be up to US$40/metre square/per month or more, for the most demanded space. Since the opening up and growth of the Vietnamese economy, both foreign and domestic enterprises have invested significantly in the construction of high-rise buildings in Vietnam. Before 1995, Saigon city centre featured generally French Colonial and other rather basic low-lying buildings. Since then, the city has seen a dramatic increase in high-rise buildings as the country has often maintained an average 8\u20138.5% annual GDP growth rate. Saigon, the country's economic hub, has achieved 12% GDP growth rate, at some times, although this has been dampened in recent years by the general world recession but not as greatly as has been felt in other parts of the world.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Vietnam\nMenara Telekom\nLandmark 81\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20111228045302/http://www.bitexco.com.vn/real-estate-investment/bitexco-financial-tower\nOfficial website\nhttp://saigonskydeck.com/\nhttp://travel.cnn.com/explorations/life/20-most-iconic-skyscrapers-343149?page=0,0\nhttp://www.realestatejournal.com/columnists_com/blueprint/20070301-blueprint.html\nAbout the project but the information is not updated as the investor has changed the design\narticle on Asia Times Online\nView of Saigon Skyline from Bitexco Building",

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%.

The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese. Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam. Although the city takes up just 0.6% of the country's land area, it contains 8.34% of the population of Vietnam, 20.2% of its GDP, 27.9% of industrial output and 34.9% of the FDI projects in the country in 2005.

The GDP adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) reached $71.5 billion, or about $10,870 per capita (approximately three times higher than the country's average). The city's Industrial Product Value was $6.4 billion, equivalent to 30% of the value of the entire nation. Export \u2013 Import Turnover through HCMC ports accounted for $36 billion, or 40% of the national total, of which export revenue reached $18.3 billion (40% of Vietnam's total export revenues). In 2007, Ho Chi Minh City's contribution to the annual revenues in the national budget increased by 30 percent, accounting for about 20.5 percent of total revenues. The consumption demand of Ho Chi Minh City is higher than other Vietnamese provinces and municipalities and 1.5 times higher than that of Hanoi.\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\nIn 2008, it attracted $8.5 billion in FDI. In 2010, the city's GDP was estimated at $20.902 billion, or about $2,800 per capita, up 11.8 percent from 2009.\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\nBy the end of 2012, the city's GDP was estimated around $28,595 billion, or about $3,700 per capita, up 9.2 percent from 2011. Total trade (export and import) reached $47.7 billion, with export at $21.57 billion and import $26.14 billion.\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\nIn 2013, GDP of the city grew 7.6% by Q1, 8.1% by Q2, and 10.3% by the end of Q3. By the end of 2013, the city's GDP grew 9.3%, with GDP per capita reaching $4,500.\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nBy the end of 2014, the city's GDP grew 9.5%, with GDP per capita reaching $5,100.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\n\nThe economy of Ho Chi Minh City consists of industries ranging from mining, seafood processing, agriculture, and construction, to tourism, finance, industry and trade. The state-owned sector makes up 33.3% of the economy, the private sector 4.6%, and the remainder in foreign investment. Concerning its economic structure, the service sector accounts for 51.1%, industry and construction account for 47.7% and forestry, agriculture and others make up just 1.2%.\nQuang Trung Software Park is a software park situated in District 12. The park is approximately 15 km (9 mi) from downtown Ho Chi Minh City and hosts software enterprises as well as dot.com companies. The park also includes a software training school. Dot.com investors here are supplied with other facilities and services such as residences and high-speed access to the internet as well as favourable taxation. Together with the Hi-Tech Park in District 9, and the 32 ha. software park inside Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone in District 7 of the city, Ho Chi Minh City aims to become an important hi-tech city in the country and the South-East Asia region.\nThis park helps the city in particular and Vietnam in general to become an outsourcing location for other enterprises in developed countries, as India has done. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, and also in construction, building materials and agricultural products. Additionally, crude oil is a popular economic base in the city. Investors are still pouring money into the city. Total local private investment was 160 billion \u0111\u1ed3ng (US$7.5 million) with 18,500 newly founded companies. Investment trends to high technology, services and real estate projects.As of June 2006, the city had three export processing zones and twelve industrial parks, in addition to Quang Trung Software Park and Ho Chi Minh City hi-tech park. Intel has invested about 1 billion dollars in a factory in the city. More than fifty banks with hundreds of branches and about 20 insurance companies are also located inside the city. The Stock Exchange, the first stock exchange in Vietnam, was opened in 2001. There are 171 medium and large-scale markets as well as several supermarket chains, shopping malls, and fashion and beauty centres.Some of the larger shopping malls and plazas opened recently include:\n\nMaximark \u2013 Multiple locations (District 10, and Tan Binh District)\nSatramart \u2013 460 3/2 Street, Ward 12, District 10\nAuchan (2016) \u2013 Multiple locations (District 10, and Go Vap District)\nLotte Mart \u2013 Multiple locations (District 7, District 11, and Tan Binh District)\nAEON Mall Tan Phu Celadon (2014) \u2013 Multiple locations (Binh Tan District, and Tan Phu District)\nSC VivoCity (2015) \u2013 1058 Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard, Tan Phong Ward, District 7\nZen Plaza (1995) \u2013 54\u201356 Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i St, District 1\nSaigon Centre (1997) \u2013 65 L\u00ea L\u1ee3i Blvd, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nDiamond Plaza (1999) \u2013 34 Le Duan Blvd, District 1\nBig C (2002) \u2013 Multiple locations (District 10, Binh Tan District, Go Vap District, Phu Nhuan District, and Tan Phu District)\nMETRO Cash & Carry/Mega Market \u2013 Multiple locations (District 2, District 6, and District 12)\nCrescent Mall \u2013 Phu My Hung, District 7\nParkson (2005\u20132009) \u2013 Multiple locations (District 1, District 2, District 5, District 7, District 11, and Tan Binh District)\nSaigon Paragon (2009) \u2013 3 Nguy\u1ec5n L\u01b0\u01a1ng B\u1eb1ng St, Tan Phu Ward, District 7\nNowZone (2009) \u2013 235 Nguyen Van Cu Ave, Nguyen Cu Trinh Ward, District 1\nKumho Asiana Plaza (2010) \u2013 39 Le Duan Blvd, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nVincom Centre (2010) \u2013 70\u201372 L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n St, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nUnion Square \u2013 171 L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n st, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1\nVincom Mega Mall (2016) \u2013 S\u1ed1 161 Xa L\u1ed9 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, P.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta.

        "wiki": "District 1 (Qu\u1eadn 1) is the central urban district of Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam. With a total area of 7.7211 km2 (2.9811 sq mi) the district has a population of 204,899 people as of 2010. The district is divided into 10 small subsets which are called wards (ph\u01b0\u1eddng). District 1 contains most of the city's administrative offices, consulates, and large buildings.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%.

The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese. Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam. Although the city takes up just 0.6% of the country's land area, it contains 8.34% of the population of Vietnam, 20.2% of its GDP, 27.9% of industrial output and 34.9% of the FDI projects in the country in 2005.

The GDP adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) reached $71.5 billion, or about $10,870 per capita (approximately three times higher than the country's average). The city's Industrial Product Value was $6.4 billion, equivalent to 30% of the value of the entire nation. Export \u2013 Import Turnover through HCMC ports accounted for $36 billion, or 40% of the national total, of which export revenue reached $18.3 billion (40% of Vietnam's total export revenues). In 2007, Ho Chi Minh City's contribution to the annual revenues in the national budget increased by 30 percent, accounting for about 20.5 percent of total revenues. The consumption demand of Ho Chi Minh City is higher than other Vietnamese provinces and municipalities and 1.5 times higher than that of Hanoi.\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\nIn 2008, it attracted $8.5 billion in FDI. In 2010, the city's GDP was estimated at $20.902 billion, or about $2,800 per capita, up 11.8 percent from 2009.\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\nBy the end of 2012, the city's GDP was estimated around $28,595 billion, or about $3,700 per capita, up 9.2 percent from 2011. Total trade (export and import) reached $47.7 billion, with export at $21.57 billion and import $26.14 billion.\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\nIn 2013, GDP of the city grew 7.6% by Q1, 8.1% by Q2, and 10.3% by the end of Q3. By the end of 2013, the city's GDP grew 9.3%, with GDP per capita reaching $4,500.\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nBy the end of 2014, the city's GDP grew 9.5%, with GDP per capita reaching $5,100.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\n\nThe economy of Ho Chi Minh City consists of industries ranging from mining, seafood processing, agriculture, and construction, to tourism, finance, industry and trade.

Concerning its economic structure, the service sector accounts for 51.1%, industry and construction account for 47.7% and forestry, agriculture and others make up just 1.2%.\nQuang Trung Software Park is a software park situated in District 12. The park is approximately 15 km (9 mi) from downtown Ho Chi Minh City and hosts software enterprises as well as dot.com companies. The park also includes a software training school. Dot.com investors here are supplied with other facilities and services such as residences and high-speed access to the internet as well as favourable taxation. Together with the Hi-Tech Park in District 9, and the 32 ha. software park inside Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone in District 7 of the city, Ho Chi Minh City aims to become an important hi-tech city in the country and the South-East Asia region.\nThis park helps the city in particular and Vietnam in general to become an outsourcing location for other enterprises in developed countries, as India has done. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, and also in construction, building materials and agricultural products. Additionally, crude oil is a popular economic base in the city. Investors are still pouring money into the city. Total local private investment was 160 billion \u0111\u1ed3ng (US$7.5 million) with 18,500 newly founded companies. Investment trends to high technology, services and real estate projects.As of June 2006, the city had three export processing zones and twelve industrial parks, in addition to Quang Trung Software Park and Ho Chi Minh City hi-tech park.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020.

To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels.

The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

She is French-Vietnamese; as her father is French-Vietnamese. Therefore, she owns a nickname as Ho An Tay of which \"An\" is from her father's name and \"Tay\" is used to refer his mixed blood. Her parents worked in banking field. When she was 12 years old, she lived apart from family as she was enrolled in piano major at Military Art and Culture College and lived in dormitory instead. When she was 15 years old as her height was already 1,73m, she decided to pursue modelling and gained a few awards such as: runner-up of Ha Noi Supermodel, first prize winner of Vietnam Supermodel and runner-up of Asia's Model Searching competition. In 2003, after moving to Ho Chi Minh City, she made an appearance as being a singer for the first time at Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0110\u1eb9p H\u00e1t show. Afterward, songwriter Quoc Bao invited her to take part in one song of his upcoming album. Being highly rated from Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0110\u1eb9p H\u00e1t show and songwriter Quoc Bao altogether, she decided to pursue singing.In 2001, she was chosen by director Luu Trong Ninh to portray a character in TV drama Hoa Co May, the drama was aired in Saturday Cinema Show on VTV3 at the time. Her first on-screen debut is Huong - an American-Vietnamese girl with tough personality. At that time, she was studying Piano Major at Military Art and Culture College. During this time, there were many rumors about her regarding love. The most infamous one was Huy MC in mid 2014 which led singer Phuong Thanh slapped Ngoc Ha in the name of her friend who is Thu Phuong. However, later in an interview, Phuong Thanh shared that she only wanted to do that via model Xuan Lan and it never happened. In 2010, they performed the song \u0110\u00eam Nghe Ti\u1ebfng M\u01b0a (Listening to Night Rain) together at Song Ca C\u00f9ng Th\u1ea7n T\u01b0\u1ee3ng (Duet With Idol) show, their relationship is fine as they often compliment each other on many stages.She made a breakthrough with the album 24 Gi\u1edd 7 Ng\u00e0y (24 hours 7 days). In the first album ever, she already made her first hit as the song 24 Gi\u1edd 7 Ng\u00e0y (24 Hours 7 Days). However, being a model still prevented her from making much success in music industry, but it was a firm foundation to prove her own position.\n\n\n=== 2001: Career debut ===\nIn 2001, she was chosen by director Luu Trong Ninh to portray a character in TV drama Hoa Co May, the drama was aired in Saturday Cinema Show on VTV3 at the time. Her first on-screen debut is Huong - an American-Vietnamese girl with tough personality. At that time, she was studying Piano Major at Military Art and Culture College. Although her acting career was short-lived, the audience was still impressed by her.\nIn 2005, after the release of 39 \u0110\u1ed9 Y\u00eau (39 Degree of Love) and Chi\u1ebfn D\u1ecbch Tr\u00e1i Tim B\u00ean Ph\u1ea3i (Right-heart Campaign), she temporarily stopped acting to focus on singing instead.\n\n\n=== 2004: Debut album 24 Hours 7 Days ===\nShe came to Hanoi and met musician Huy Tuan in order to discuss the implementation of her first album. After that, Huy Tuan began working on her debut album as a producer, which was named as 24 Gi\u1edd 7 Ng\u00e0y (24 Hours 7 Days), which was released in 2004 by Viet Tan Studio. The songs in the album were produced by Tuan and were composed by famous songwriters such as Duc Tri, Nguyen Xinh Xo, Hong Kien, Duong Thu, An Hieu and Huy Tuan. In the album, the song with same name as the title gained a lot of success and was performed by her on various music shows. In spite of much investment, this album did not make much resonance for her because the album was not widely advertised and there was no promotional music video, until her nude \"art\" photos were posted online; then her name was mentioned everywhere. In addition, that was when feelings emerged between her and musician Duc Tri. Tri is a close friend of musician Huy Tuan, so the album used his song H\u00f4m Nay Anh \u0110\u1ebfn (Today He Comes). After that, Tuan introduced two acquaintances and their feelings at the time were a great concern of the media.\n\n\n=== 2005: V\u00e0 Em \u0110\u00e3 Y\u00eau and start acting again. ===\nShe signed a record deal with songwriter Duc Tri's Music Faces Records, they then worked together for her second album following Huy Tuan's advice.

The album was well made primarily focusing on Ho Ngoc Ha's strong image. There were 5 songs in the album composed by Phuong Uyen, Ho Quang Minh and Duc Tri, the 5 other songs were her old songs remixed. Two hit songs of the album were \u0110\u00eam Nghe Ti\u1ebfng M\u01b0a (Listening to Night Rain) and V\u00e0 Em \u0110\u00e3 Y\u00eau (And I'm In Love) helped Ho Ngoc Ha become well-known afterward.\nAfter the release of second album, she came back to acting in TV drama version of 39 \u0110\u1ed9 Y\u00eau (39 Degree of Love) consisting 16 episodes - which used to be a 90 minute in length movie that had been released in several Vietnam box office previously. The drama was not as impressive as expected and was criticised by audiences. VnExpress said the movie was a \"messy magic show\" with \"terrible cut from the original\". Later, she joined the movie title Chi\u1ebfn D\u1ecbch Tr\u00e1i Tim B\u00ean Ph\u1ea3i (Right Heart Campaign) released on 10 June 2005.

However, the album wasn't widely advertised and promoted, thus there was no hit in the album, therefore it was considered as a flop of her career. Also in that year, on S\u1ee9c S\u1ed1ng M\u1edbi Show, host Thanh Mai and Trung Dung carried an interview partially regarding her love and career. However, it was said by a source that she had already broken up with Duc Tri for 1 year already. This created confusion but she officially made the announcement regarding the rumor as: \"Right now, I'm being at the peaceful stage of my life. Lots of people are curious of why I look so happy though I've had gone through a break up recently. But it's my real feeling. I love with all of my heart therefore once I break up, I regret nothing\". Years after the official break up, she still kept on working and collaborate with Music Faces Records.\nIn 2009, she was officially back on stage with the album The First Single after a two-year hiatus. This time especially, Duc Tri wasn't a part of the album's production but by many young musicians such as Duong Khac Linh, Hoang Anh and Hung Lan instead. Many copies were sold and received plenty of positive reviews from the audience. Xin H\u00e3y Th\u1ee9 Tha (My Apology) featuring rapper Suboi is considered one of the best songs of her career. She performed the English version of Xin H\u00e3y Th\u1ee9 Tha named My Apology at Asia Song Festival in Korea.According to Korean audience, this is the first time ever Vietnam representative defeated other Asian opponents due to her charming look.

She admitted to be pregnant shortly afterward, regarding the father's identity of the baby which she avoided mentioning on the news, however she hoped Cuong would be a responsible father and husband for her and her baby. Many sources said that Ho Ngoc Ha dated Cuong for money and fortune since Cuong is widely known as the son of the successful businesswoman Nguyen Thi Nhu Loan, one of the richest businesswomen in Vietnam with trillion billion Vietnam Dong worth of property. Following this incident, it was revealed that she used to get married at the age of 16.\nAfter giving birth, she came back with her new album titled T\u00ecm L\u1ea1i Gi\u1ea5c M\u01a1 (Finding Dreams) in 2010. She recorded the album while being pregnant and the release was made right after giving birth. This was the first album without Duc Tri's anticipation and also the last album released by Music Faces Records, Duc Tri openly supported her departure and shared his thought accordingly as: \"It's totally normal when she leaves.

Especially, Th\u00eam M\u1ed9t L\u1ea7n V\u1ee1 Tan (One More Break Up) was composed and written by Ho Ngoc Ha herself. However, the song resembled Kylie Minogue's Red Blooded Woman. Speaking of this incident, she said that two songs were completely different, thus she wasn't responsible for the final production and remix whatsoever.In the promotion for the new album, she continuously cooperated with Sunsilk to hold a small show T\u00ecm L\u1ea1i Gi\u1ea5c M\u01a1 in 2010, with same guest artists like the previous show but this time, V-Music band and Ha Anh Tuan were newly added.\nHo Ngoc Ha and V-Music band partnered up for their album Ng\u00e0y H\u1ea1nh Ph\u00fac (Happy Day) released in August 2010 in Vietnam; 2 August on iTunes.

Especially in 2009, while being a guest at the auction T\u1ebft L\u00e0m \u0110i\u1ec1u Hay (Doing Great Things In Tet), she auctioned the 72 year old golden apricot blossom named \"Long D\u00e1ng Nghinh Xu\u00e2n\", however she didn't win. On her official website, she and her fanclub later donated 30 million VND from the sale of previous booklet release. In early 2011, she and other singers participated in the show T\u1ed5 \u1ea4m Ng\u00e0y Xu\u00e2n by Citizen Committee of Ho Chi Minh City and Bureau of Ho Chi Minh City at Tao \u0110\u00e0n Park. At the show, she gave away 200 presents and 400 lucky money envelopes for orphans and children living in unfortunate condition in Ho Chi Minh City. For being wholeheartedly devoted in society and charity activities, she was also rewarded with an honorary from Citizen Committee of Ho Chi Minh City. Later, she and other artists together held the show Ng\u00e0y H\u1ea1nh Ph\u00fac (Happy Day) with the consulting from journalist Ng\u00f4 B\u00e1 L\u1ee5c from vnMedia on 8 March 2011. The organization of Ng\u00e0y H\u1ea1nh Ph\u00fac (Happy Day) released an official statement on the website as those who would be able to receive their gifts would be \"lottery sellers, cleaning workers, street vendors, casual labors, homeless children, trash collectors,...families that living under the bridges or bus stops. Those won't be certainly confirmed but based on on-site evaluation from the volunteers\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nHoa C\u1ecf May (2001) - H\u01b0\u01a1ng\n39 \u0111\u1ed9 y\u00eau (2005)\nChi\u1ebfn d\u1ecbch tr\u00e1i tim b\u00ean ph\u1ea3i (2005)\nHi sinh \u0111\u1eddi trai  (2015)\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe Voice (2012) - Judge (one season)\nGot To Dance (2013) - Judge (Season 1)\nX Factor (2014) - Judge (Season 1)\nThe Remix (2015 - 2016) - Judge (Season 1 - 2)\nVietnam Super Model (2016) - Judge\nThe Face Vietnam (2016) - Mentor (Season 1)\nYour Face Sound Familiar Vietnam (2019-2020) - Judge (Season 7)\n\n\n== Albums ==\nVol 1: 24 gi\u1edd 7 ng\u00e0y (24 hours 7 days) (2004)\nVol 2:  V\u00e0 em \u0111\u00e3 y\u00eau  (And I Fell in Love) (2005)\nVol 3: Mu\u1ed1n n\u00f3i v\u1edbi anh (To Tell You) (2006)\nVol 4: Khi ta y\u00eau nhau (When We Love Each Other) (2007)\nVol 5: T\u00ecm l\u1ea1i gi\u1ea5c m\u01a1 (Find a Dream) (2010)\nVol 6: S\u1ebd m\u00e3i b\u00ean nhau -Invincible (Will Be Together) (2011)\nVol 7: M\u1ed1i t\u00ecnh x\u01b0a (Past Romance) (2014)\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Xin h\u00e3y th\u1ee9 tha\" (My Apology) (2009)\n\"N\u1ed7i nh\u1edb \u0111\u1ea7y v\u01a1i\" (ft.Noo Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1ecbnh) (2011)\n\"Y\u00eau sao m\u00e1i t\u00f3c Vi\u1ec7t Nam\" (2012)\n\"\u0110\u1eafn \u0110o\"  (Consider) (2012)\n\"Bay l\u00ean t\u00ecnh y\u00eau\"  (Blow Up) (2012)\n\"I LOVE YOU\"  (ft.Vmusic band) (2012)\n\"H\u00e3y th\u1ee9 tha cho em\"  (Please Forgive Me) (2013)\n\"Em \u0111i t\u00ecm anh\" (ft.Noo Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1ecbnh) (2015)\n\"What is love\" (2015)\n\"Destiny\" (2015)\n\"T\u1ed9i l\u1ed7i\" (2015) - Directed by \u0110inh H\u00e0 Uy\u00ean Th\u01b0\n\"Keep me in love\" (2016)\n\n\n== Performances ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The building was constructed when Vietnam was part of French Indochina in the late 19th century. It counts with Gothic, Renaissance and French influences. It was constructed between 1886 and 1891 and is now a tourist attraction.\n\nIt was designed by Alfred Foulhoux, but is often erroneously credited as being the work of Gustave Eiffel or a collaboration between Foulhoux and Hanoi-based Auguste Henri Vildieu. As translated by the historian Tim Doling, the journal Architecte constructeur: Revue du monde architectural et artistique of 15 September 1891 commented: \u201cThe inauguration the new Saigon Post Office, which was held on July 14, had been postponed until the return of the Governor General. This monument, adorned with a most artistic fa\u00e7ade, is particularly well laid out and well equipped for the different services to which it is intended; it does the greatest honour to the skill and talent of the distinguished Chief Architect of the Colony, M. Foulhoux.\u201dInside the Saigon Central Post office of special note are two painted maps that were created just after the post office was built, the first one located on the left side of the building is a map of Southern Vietnam and Cambodia titled Lignes telegraphiques du Sud Vietnam et Cambodge 1892 which translates to \"Telegraphic lines of Southern Vietnam and Cambodia 1892\". The second map of greater Saigon is titled Saigon et ses environs 1892 that translates as \"Saigon and its surroundings 1892\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Web Site ==\nHo Chi Minh Post Office",

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%. Ho Chi Minh City's largest minority ethnic group are the Chinese (Hoa) with 5.78%. Cholon \u2013 in District 5 and parts of Districts 6, 10 and 11 \u2013 is home to the largest Chinese community in Vietnam. The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese. Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam. Although the city takes up just 0.6% of the country's land area, it contains 8.34% of the population of Vietnam, 20.2% of its GDP, 27.9% of industrial output and 34.9% of the FDI projects in the country in 2005. In 2005, the city had 4,344,000 labourers, of whom 130,000 are over the labour age norm (in Vietnam, 60 for male and 55 for female workers). In 2009, GDP per capita reached $2,800, compared to the country's average level of $1,042.\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nAs of June 2006, the city has been home to three export processing zones and twelve industrial parks.

To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "Gi\u00e1c L\u00e2m Pagoda (Vietnamese: Ch\u00f9a Gi\u00e1c L\u00e2m; ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: \u89ba\u6797\u5bfa, Gi\u00e1c L\u00e2m t\u1ef1) is a historic Buddhist pagoda in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam. Built in 1744, it is one of the oldest temples in the city.  It was officially listed as a historical site by the Vietnamese Department of Culture on November 16, 1988 under Decision 1288 VH/QD.  The pagoda is located at 118 L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n, in the 23rd ward of T\u00e2n B\u00ecnh district, in the Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd H\u00f2a region of the city.  It stands on C\u1ea9m S\u01a1n, and is also known as C\u1ea9m \u0110\u1ec7m and S\u01a1n Can.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was built by L\u00fd Th\u1ee5y Long, a native of Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng, in the spring of 1744, i.e., during the season of the Vietnamese new year, during the reign of Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t of the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords, then the ruling family of southern Vietnam. The history chronicles of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, the then name of the settlement that later became Saigon and then Ho Chi Minh City, written by Tr\u1ecbnh Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c describes the area as being quite undeveloped at the time, with dense foliage resembling a jungle. The area was surrounded by flower gardens. In its formative years, the temple was a gathering place during the T\u1ebft new year and the temple was a scenic lookout on a hill overlooking the Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh markets.In 1772, Th\u00edch Vi\u00ean Quang of the L\u00e2m t\u1ebf Zen lineage arrive to become the abbot of the temple. From then on, the temple was known by its current name of Giac Lam.The temple has gone through many periods of renovation and reconstruction. The first notable period of renovation took place between 1799 and 1804, when Th\u00edch Vi\u00ean Quang allowed the total reconstruction of the temple. From 1906 until 1909, Th\u00edch H\u1ed3ng H\u01b0ng, with the assistance of Th\u00edch Nh\u01b0 Ph\u00f2ng, organised for a second total renovation and rebuilding of the temple. The history of these renovations is recorded and is on display in the main hall of the temple.\n\n\n== Site ==\nGiac Lam Pagoda is built on a spacious plot, which has now been surrounded by the urban sprawl of the city. The pagoda and the grounds are completely surrounded by walls.\n\n\n=== Garden and bodhi tree ===\n\nImmediately upon entering through the main gate is the garden, which is dominated by a large statue of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara under a tall and healthy bodhi tree, a species of which Prince Siddhartha sat under while gaining enlightenment to become Gautama Buddha. The tree present in the garden was brought to Vietnam from Sri Lanka by the famous 20th Sinhalese Theravada Buddhist monk Narada, known for his worldwide efforts in propagating the dharma. The tree arrived on June 18, 1953 and was also accompanied by the arrival of a sample of the relics of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n=== Seven-stories stupa ===\n\nOn June 17, 1994, the Unified Buddhist Congregation of Vietnam staged an opening ceremony for a large stupa that was built for the purpose of the storing the relics of the Buddha. The ceremony was accompanied by the arrival of the Buddha's relics from Long V\u00e2n Temple in B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh, where the relics had been stored since their delivery in 1953 by Venerable Narada.The stupa is seven storeys high, on hexagonal shape, and each storey comprises tiled roofs and doors. The construction of the stupa began in 1970 under the architectural plans of V\u0129nh Ho\u1eb1ng, until construction was temporarily in 1975 following the fall of Saigon to communist North Vietnam and the chaos of the dissolution of South Vietnam. However, construction was put on hold for a long time, and did not resume until 1993. The tower stands 32 m and looks eastwards. It currently is one of the tallest Buddhist towers in the city and is a noted landmark of the city.\n\n\n=== Pagoda ===\n\nThe main building of the pagoda itself is of rectangular shape, measuring 65 m in length and 22 m in width. The building comprises three main rooms: the main ceremonial hall, the dharma preaching hall and the meal hall, notwithstanding the other accessory rooms and buildings. In all, there are 98 pillars in the temple. On the pillars are carved 86 phrases, continuously around the temple, with inscriptions in gold paint in an articulate way. The entrance to the building is adorned with dragons. The altars in the main ceremonial hall are made from precious wood, which makes it particularly sturdy.\n\nThe main altar is dominated by a statue of Amitabha Buddha.  In front of Amitabha is a row of five seated figures: they are Sakyamuni Buddha and the four principal bodhisattvas: Samantabhadra, Manjusri, Avalokiteshvara, and Mahasthamaprapta.  They form a group that is typical for Mahayanist pagodas of southern Vietnam.In all, Giac Lam Pagoda has 112 historic statues, made from wood with gold coatings painted onto the exterior. In addition, there are seven bronze statues. All of the statues, tables and the relic tower are hand crafted. The oldest statue is one of Gautama Buddha on a lotus seat that dates back to the 18th century. It is made of wood and stands 65 cm tall and 38 cm wide and is located in the dharma hall. The Nine Dragons altar in the main hall depicts the birth of Prince Siddhartha (Vesak) and is made of bronze. There are two sets of statues depict eighteen arahants. The smaller set consists of statues totalling 57 cm in height; the base is 7 cm while the remainder is the base of the statue. These were created at the start of the 19th century. The larger set stands approximately 95 cm in total height, with a base of 15 cm, and was created in the early years of the 20th century. The two sets of arahant statues are placed on either side of the Buddha statue in the main building.\n\n\n=== Stupas of abbots ===\nOn the left side of the temple is a series of stupas for each of the abbots who have presided over the temple: Th\u00edch Vi\u00ean Quang, Th\u00edch H\u1ea3i T\u1ecbnh, Th\u00edch Minh Vi, Th\u00edch Minh Khi\u00eam, Th\u00edch Nh\u01b0 L\u1ee3i and Th\u00edch Nh\u01b0 Ph\u00f2ng. The complex is also the location of the stupa of the patriarch Th\u00edch Ph\u1eadt \u00dd, the master of the patriarch Th\u00edch Vi\u00ean Quang, who was the abbot of S\u1eafc t\u1ee9 T\u1eeb \u00c2n. The remains were moved to Gi\u00e1c L\u00e2m in 1923.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nHa Van Tran, Buddhist Temples in Vietnam (Hanoi: Social Sciences Publishing House, 1993), pp. 338\u2013345.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (; Vietnamese: [h\u00f2 c\u01d0 m\u012b\u014b\u031f] (listen), Saigon: [h\u00f2 c\u01d0 m\u0268\u0304n]; Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m: \u80e1\u5fd7\u660e; 19 May 1890 \u2013 2 September 1969), born Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung, also known as Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c, B\u00e1c H\u1ed3, or simply B\u00e1c ('Uncle', pronounced [\u0294\u0253a\u02d0k\u031a\u02e6\u02e5]), was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician. He served as Prime Minister of Vietnam from 1945 to 1955 and President from 1945 to 1969. Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist, he served as Chairman and First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Vietnam.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh led the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the Communist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, ending the First Indochina War. He was a key figure in the People's Army of Vietnam and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng during the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975. Democratic Republic of Vietnam was victorious against the United States and was reunified with the Republic of South Vietnam in 1976. Saigon, the former capital of South Vietnam, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honor. Ho officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems and died in 1969.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's life before he came to power in Vietnam is ambiguous. He is known to have used between 50 to 200 pseudonyms. His birth is subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely.Aside from being a politician, Ho was also a writer, a poet and a journalist. He wrote several books, articles and poems in French, Chinese and Vietnamese.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was born as Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung in 1890 in the village of Ho\u00e0ng Tr\u00f9 (the name of the local temple near L\u00e0ng Sen), his mother's village. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years: 1891, 1892, 1894 and 1895. From 1895, he grew up in his father Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh S\u1eafc (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Huy)'s village of L\u00e0ng Sen, Kim Li\u00ean, Nam \u0110\u00e0n, and Ngh\u1ec7 An Province. He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the French Army; his brother Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a geomancer and traditional herbalist; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Ho) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. He quickly mastered Chinese writing, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism, while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing. In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name at the age of 10: Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Accomplished\").\nHis father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe (Qui Nh\u01a1n). He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the cane as punishment for an infraction. His father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy, but he refused because it meant serving the French. This exposed Th\u00e0nh (Ho) to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province. Nevertheless, he received a French education, attending Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc (lyc\u00e9e or secondary education) in Hu\u1ebf. His disciples, Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, also attended the school, as did Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the future President of South Vietnam (and political rival).\n\n\n=== First sojourn in France ===\nPreviously, it was believed that Th\u00e0nh (Ho) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-corv\u00e9e) demonstration of poor peasants in Hu\u1ebf in May 1908, which endangered his student status at Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc. However, a document from the Centre des archives d'Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-corv\u00e9e demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908). The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese Communist leaders, as shown in North Vietnamese President T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng's falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea revolt.\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged, but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at D\u1ee5c Thanh school in Phan Thi\u1ebft for about six months, then traveled to Saigon.He worked as a kitchen helper on a French steamer, the Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville, using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in Marseille, France on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for Le Havre and Dunkirk, returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School, but his application was rejected. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from 1911 to 1917.\n\n\n=== In the United States ===\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City (Harlem) and Boston, where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the Parker House Hotel. The only evidence that he was in the United States is a letter to French colonial administrators dated 15 December 1912 and postmarked New York City (he gave as his address Poste Restante in Le Havre and his occupation as a sailor) and a postcard to Phan Chu Trinh in Paris where he mentioned working at the Parker House Hotel. Inquiries to the Parker House management revealed no records of his ever having worked there. Among a series of menial jobs, he claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in Brooklyn between 1917 and 1918 and for General Motors as a line manager. It is believed that while in the United States he made contact with Korean nationalists, an experience that developed his political outlook. Sophie Quinn-Judge states that this is \"in the realm of conjecture\". He was also influenced by Pan-Africanist and Black nationalist Marcus Garvey during his stay and said he attended meetings of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\n\n\n=== In Britain ===\n\nAt various points between 1913 and 1919, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) claimed to have lived in West Ealing and later in Crouch End, Hornsey. He reportedly worked as either a chef or dish washer (reports vary) at the Drayton Court Hotel in West Ealing. Claims that he trained as a pastry chef under Auguste Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, Westminster are not supported by documentary evidence. The wall of New Zealand House, home of the New Zealand High Commission, which now stands on the site of the Carlton Hotel, displays a blue plaque. During 1913, Th\u00e0nh was also employed as a pastry chef on the Newhaven\u2013Dieppe ferry route.\n\n\n== Political education in France ==\n\nFrom 1919 to 1923, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) began to show an interest in politics while living in France, being influenced by his friend and Socialist Party of France comrade Marcel Cachin. Th\u00e0nh claimed to have arrived in Paris from London in 1917, but the French police only had documents recording his arrival in June 1919. In Paris he joined the Groupe des Patriotes Annamites (The Group of Vietnamese Patriots) that included Phan Chu Trinh, Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ebf Truy\u1ec1n and Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh. They had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for Vietnamese independence under the pseudonym Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Patriot\") prior to Th\u00e0nh's arrival in Paris. The group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the Vietnamese people in French Indochina to the Western powers at the Versailles peace talks, but they were ignored. Citing the principle of self-determination outlined prior to the peace accords, they requested the allied powers to end French colonial rule of Vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government.\nPrior to the conference, the group sent their letter to allied leaders, including Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and President Woodrow Wilson. They were unable to obtain consideration at Versailles, but the episode would later help establish the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the symbolic leader of the anti-colonial movement at home in Vietnam. Since Th\u00e0nh was the public face behind the publication of the document (although it was written by Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng), he soon became known as Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c and first used the name in September during an interview with a Chinese newspaper correspondent.Many authors have stated that 1919 was a lost \"Wilsonian moment\", where the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh could have adopted a pro-American and less radical position if only President Wilson had received him. However, at the time of the Versailles Conference, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was committed to a socialist program. While the conference was ongoing, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c was already delivering speeches on the prospects of Bolshevism in Asia and was attempting to persuade French Socialists to join Lenin's Communist International.In December 1920, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) became a representative to the Congress of Tours of the Socialist Party of France, voted for the Third International and was a founding member of the French Communist Party. Taking a position in the Colonial Committee of the party, he tried to draw his comrades' attention towards people in French colonies including Indochina, but his efforts were often unsuccessful. While living in Paris, he reportedly had a relationship with a dressmaker named Marie Bri\u00e8re. As discovered in 2018, Qu\u1ed1c also had relations with the members of Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea like Kim Kyu-sik while in Paris.During this period, he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as running his Vietnamese nationalist group. In May 1922, he wrote an article for a French magazine criticizing the use of English words by French sportswriters. The article implored Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 to outlaw such Franglais as le manager, le round and le knock-out. His articles and speeches caught the attention of Dmitry Manuilsky, who would soon sponsor his trip to the Soviet Union and under whose tutelage he would become a high-ranking member of the Soviet Comintern.\n\n\n== In the Soviet Union and China ==\n\nIn 1923, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) left Paris for Moscow carrying a passport with the name Chen Vang, a Chinese merchant, where he was employed by the Comintern, studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East and participated in the Fifth Comintern Congress in June 1924 before arriving in Canton (present-day Guangzhou), China in November 1924 using the name Ly Thuy.\nIn 1925\u20131926, he organized \"Youth Education Classes\" and occasionally gave socialist lectures to Vietnamese revolutionary young people living in Canton at the Whampoa Military Academy. These young people would become the seeds of a new revolutionary, pro-communist movement in Vietnam several years later. According to William Duiker, he lived with a Chinese woman, Zeng Xueming (T\u0103ng Tuy\u1ebft Minh), whom he married on 18 October 1926. When his comrades objected to the match, he told them: \"I will get married despite your disapproval because I need a woman to teach me the language and keep house\". She was 21 and he was 36. They married in the same place where Zhou Enlai had married earlier and then lived in the residence of a Comintern agent, Mikhail Borodin.Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Ch\u00ed argued that in June 1925 he betrayed Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, the famous leader of a rival revolutionary faction and his father's old friend, to French Secret Service agents in Shanghai for 100,000 piastres. A source states that he later claimed he did it because he expected Ch\u00e2u's trial to stir up anti-French sentiment and because he needed the money to establish a communist organization. In Ho Chi Minh: A Life, William Duiker considered this hypothesis, but ultimately rejected it. Other sources claim that Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Huy\u1ec7n was responsible for Chau's capture. Chau, sentenced to lifetime house arrest, never denounced Qu\u1ed1c.\nAfter Chiang Kai-shek's 1927 anti-Communist coup, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) left Canton again in April 1927 and returned to Moscow, spending part of the summer of 1927 recuperating from tuberculosis in Crimea before returning to Paris once more in November. He then returned to Asia by way of Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland and Italy, where he sailed to Bangkok, Thailand, arriving in July 1928. \"Although we have been separated for almost a year, our feelings for each other do not have to be said to be felt\", he reassured Minh in an intercepted letter. In this period, he served as a senior agent undertaking Comintern activities in Southeast Asia.\n\nQu\u1ed1c (Ho) remained in Thailand, staying in the Thai village of Nachok until late 1929, when he moved on to India and then Shanghai. In Hong Kong in early 1930, he chaired a meeting with representatives from two Vietnamese Communist parties to merge them into a unified organization, the Communist Party of Vietnam. In June 1931, he was arrested. To reduce French pressure for extradition, he was reported as dead in 1932. The British quietly released him in January 1933. He moved to the Soviet Union and in Moscow studied and taught at the Lenin Institute. In this period he reportedly lost his positions in the Comintern because of a concern that he had betrayed the organization. However, according to Ton That Thien's research, he was a member of the inner circle of the Comintern, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Dmitry Manuilsky and a member in good standing of the Comintern throughout the Great Purge.In 1938, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) returned to China and served as an advisor to the Chinese Communist armed forces. He was also the senior Comintern agent in charge of Asian affairs. He worked extensively in Chungking and traveled to Guiyang, Kunming and Guilin. He was using the name H\u1ed3 Quang during this period.\n\n\n== Independence movement ==\nIn 1941, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement. The Japanese occupation of Indochina that year, the first step toward invasion of the rest of Southeast Asia, created an opportunity for patriotic Vietnamese. The so-called \"men in black\" were a 10,000 member guerrilla force that operated with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. He oversaw many successful military actions against the Vichy France and Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II, supported closely yet clandestinely by the United States Office of Strategic Services and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946\u20131954). He was jailed in China by Chiang Kai-shek's local authorities before being rescued by Chinese Communists. Following his release in 1943, he returned to Vietnam. It was during this time that he began regularly using the name H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, a Vietnamese name combining a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"Bright spirit\" or \"Clear will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e: Ch\u00ed meaning \"will\" or \"spirit\" and Minh meaning \"bright\"). His new name is a tribute to General Hou Zhiming (\u4faf\u5fd7\u660e), Chief Commissar of the 4th Military Region of the National Revolutionary Army, who helped releasing him from KMT prison in 1943.\n\nIn April 1945, he met with the OSS agent Archimedes Patti and offered to provide intelligence to the allies provided that he could have \"a line of communication\" with the Allies. The OSS agreed to this and later sent a military team of OSS members to train his men and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh himself was treated for malaria and dysentery by an OSS doctor.Following the August Revolution (1945) organized by the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became Chairman of the Provisional Government (Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although he convinced Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to abdicate, his government was not recognized by any country. He repeatedly petitioned President Harry S. Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.In 1946, future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became acquainted when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. He offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam. Ben-Gurion declined, telling him: \"I am certain we shall be able to establish a Jewish Government in Palestine\".In 1946, when he traveled outside of the country, his subordinates imprisoned 2,500 non-Communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed or exiled in July 1946, notably members of the Nationalist Party of Vietnam and the Dai Viet National Party after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the Viet Minh government. All rival political parties were hereafter banned and local governments were purged to minimize opposition later on. However, it was noted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's first Congress had over two-thirds of its members come from non-Vi\u1ec7t Minh political factions, some without an election. Nationalist Party of Vietnam leader Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ea3i Th\u1ea7n was named vice president. They also held four out of ten ministerial positions.\n\n\n=== Birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ===\nFollowing Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication on 2 September 1945, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh read the Declaration of Independence of Vietnam under the name of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In Saigon, with violence between rival Vietnamese factions and French forces increasing, the British commander, General Sir Douglas Gracey, declared martial law. On 24 September, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh leaders responded with a call for a general strike.In September 1945, a force of 200,000 Republic of China Army troops arrived in Hanoi to accept the surrender of the Japanese occupiers in northern Indochina. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh made a compromise with their general, Lu Han, to dissolve the Communist Party and to hold an election which would yield a coalition government. When Chiang forced the French to give the French concessions in Shanghai back to China in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina, he had no choice but to sign an agreement with France on 6 March 1946 in which Vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union. The agreement soon broke down. The purpose of the agreement, for both the French and Vietminh, was for Chiang's army to leave North Vietnam. Fighting broke out in the North soon after the Chinese left.\nHistorian Professor Liam Kelley of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on his Le Minh Khai's SEAsian History Blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh said he \"would rather smell French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for a thousand,\" noting that Stanley Karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to him in his 1983 Vietnam: A History and that the original quote was most likely forged by the Frenchman Paul Mus in his 1952 book Vietnam: Sociologie d'une Guerre. Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam (although this was the time when China invaded Tibet). The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.\n\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of the Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946, and of the Trotskyists. Trotskyism in Vietnam did not rival the Party outside of the major cities, but particularly in the South, in Saigon-Cochinchina, they had been a challenge. From the outset, they had called for armed resistance to a French restoration and for an immediate transfer of industry to workers and land to peasants. The French Socialist leader Daniel Guerin recalls that when in Paris in 1946 he asked H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh about the fate of the Trotskyist leader T\u1ea1 Thu Th\u00e2u, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh had replied, \"with unfeigned emotion,\" that \"Th\u00e2u was a great patriot and we mourn him, but then a moment later added in a steady voice \u2018All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.\u2019\"The Communists eventually suppressed all non-Communist parties, but they failed to secure a peace deal with France. In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the Dalat and Fontainebleau conferences, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by French forces at Hanoi only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The bombardment of Haiphong reportedly killed more than 6000 Vietnamese civilians. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Ho Chi Minh declared war against the French Union, marking the beginning of the Indochina War. The Vietnam National Army, mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked. They assaulted the French positions, smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper, destroying armored vehicles with \"lunge mines\" (a hollow-charge warhead on the end of a pole, detonated by thrusting the charge against the side of a tank; typically a suicide weapon) and Molotov cocktails, holding off attackers by using roadblocks, landmines and gravel. After two months of fighting, the exhausted Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces withdrew after systematically destroying any valuable infrastructure. Ho was reported to be captured by a group of French soldiers led by Jean-\u00c9tienne Valluy at Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc in Operation Lea. The person in question turned out to be a Vi\u1ec7t Minh advisor who was killed trying to escape.\nAccording to journalist Bernard Fall, Ho decided to negotiate a truce after fighting the French for several years. When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Ho expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of a number of Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.In February 1950, after the successful removal of the French border blockade, he met with Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in Moscow after the Soviet Union recognized his government. They all agreed that China would be responsible for backing the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. Mao Zedong's emissary to Moscow stated in August that China planned to train 60,000\u201370,000 Viet Minh in the near future. The road to the outside world was open for Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces to receive additional supplies which would allow them to escalate the fight against the French regime throughout Indochina. At the outset of the conflict, Ho reportedly told a French visitor: \"You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and I will win\". In 1954, the First Indochina War came to an end after the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu, where more than 10,000 French soldiers surrendered to the Viet Minh. The subsequent Geneva Accords peace process partitioned North Vietnam at the 17th parallel.\nArthur Dommen estimates that the Vi\u1ec7t Minh killed between 50,000 and 100,000 civilians during the war. However, Smedberg estimates that there were less than 150,000 civilian casualties. By comparison to Dommen's calculation, Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000\u2013250,000 civilian deaths.\n\n\n== Becoming president ==\n\nThe 1954 Geneva Accords concluded between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, allowing the latter's forces to regroup in the North whilst anti-Communist groups settled in the South. His Democratic Republic of Vietnam relocated to Hanoi and became the government of North Vietnam, a Communist-led one-party state. Following the Geneva Accords, there was to be a 300-day period in which people could freely move between the two regions of Vietnam, later known as South Vietnam and North Vietnam. During the 300 days, Di\u1ec7m and CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Di\u1ec7m's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan \"God has gone south\". Between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people migrated to the South, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Di\u1ec7m in temporary control of the South.All the parties at Geneva called for reunification elections, but they could not agree on the details. Recently appointed Vi\u1ec7t Minh acting foreign minister Pham Van Dong proposed elections under the supervision of \"local commissions\". The United States, with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, suggested United Nations supervision. This plan was rejected by Soviet representative Vyacheslav Molotov, who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and non-communist members, which could determine \"important\" issues only by unanimous agreement. The negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification. North Vietnam argued that the elections should be held within six months of the ceasefire while the Western allies sought to have no deadline. Molotov proposed June 1955, then later softened this to any time in 1955 and finally July 1956. The Diem government supported reunification elections, but only with effective international supervision, arguing that genuinely free elections were otherwise impossible in the totalitarian North. By the afternoon of 20 July, the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and the elections for a reunified government should be held in July 1956, two years after the ceasefire. The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam was only signed by the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military commands, with no participation or consultation of the State of Vietnam. Based on a proposal by Chinese delegation head Zhou Enlai, an International Control Commission (ICC) chaired by India, with Canada and Poland as members, was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire. Because issues were to be decided unanimously, Poland's presence in the ICC provided the Communists with effective veto power over supervision of the treaty. The unsigned Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference called for reunification elections, which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections, insisting that the ICC's \"competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties\". Of the nine nations represented, only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration. Undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith delivered a \"unilateral declaration\" of the United States position, reiterating: \"We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to ensure that they are conducted fairly\".\n\nBetween 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which were accompanied by significant political repression. During the land reform, testimonies by North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which if extrapolated would indicate a nationwide total of nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was mainly concentrated in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions was widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although it was likely greater than 13,500.\n\n\n== The Vietnam War ==\nAs early as June 1956 the idea of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government was presented at a politburo meeting. In 1959, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh began urging the Politburo to send aid to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng in South Vietnam and a \"people's war\" on the South was approved at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. North Vietnam invaded Laos in July 1959 aided by the Pathet Lao and used 30,000 men to build a network of supply and reinforcement routes running through Laos and Cambodia that became known as the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail. It allowed the North to send manpower and material to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng with much less exposure to South Vietnamese forces, achieving a considerable advantage. To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng was stressed in Communist propaganda. North Vietnam created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 as a \"united front\", or political branch of the Viet Cong intended to encourage the participation of non-Communists.At the end of 1959, conscious that the national election would never be held and that Diem intended to purge opposing forces (mostly ex Vi\u1ec7t Minh) from the South Vietnamese society, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh informally chose L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n to become the next party leader. This was interpreted by Western analysts as a loss of influence for H\u1ed3, who was said to actually have preferred the more moderate V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p for the position. From 1959 onward, the elderly Ho became increasingly worried about the prospect of his death, and that year he wrote down his will. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was officially named party leader in 1960, leaving H\u1ed3 to function in a secondary role as head of state and member of the Politburo. He nevertheless maintained considerable influence in the government. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, T\u1ed1 H\u1eefu, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng often shared dinner with H\u1ed3, and all of them remained key figures throughout and after the war. In the early 1960s, the North Vietnamese Politburo was divided the \"North first\" faction who favored focusing on the economic development of North Vietnam, and the \"South first\" faction, who favored a guerrilla war in South Vietnam to reunite Vietnam in the near future.Between 1961 and 1963, 40,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated into South Vietnam from the North. In 1963, H\u1ed3 purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Diem in hopes of achieving a negotiated peace. During the so-called \"Maneli Affair\" of 1963, a French diplomatic initiative was launched with the aim of achieving a federation of the two Vietnams, which would be neutral in the Cold War. The four principle diplomats involved in the \"Maneli affair\" were Ramchundur Goburdhun, the Indian Chief Commissioner of the ICC; Mieczys\u0142aw Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC; Roger Lalouette, the French ambassador to South Vietnam; and Giovanni d'Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam. Maneli reported that Ho was very interested in the signs of a split between President Diem and President Kennedy and that his attitude was: \"Our real enemies are the Americans. Get rid them, and we can cope with Diem and Nhu afterward\".At a meeting in Hanoi held in French, Ho told Goburdhun that Diem was \"in his own way a patriot\", noting that Diem had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time Goburdhun met Diem \"shake hands with him for me\". The North Vietnamese Premier Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, speaking on behalf of Ho, told Maneli he was interested in the peace plan, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam \"we can come to an agreement with any Vietnamese\". On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man to Diem to discuss the French peace plan. It remains unclear if the Ngo brothers were serious about the French peace plan or were merely using the possibility of accepting it to blackmail the United States into supporting them at a time when the Buddhist crisis had seriously strained relations between Saigon and Washington. Supporting the latter theory is the fact that Nhu promptly leaked his meeting with Maneli to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who publicized it in a column entitled \"Very Ugly Stuff\". The mere possibility that the Ngo brothers might accept the peace plan helped persuade the Kennedy administration to support the coup against them. On 1 November 1963, a coup overthrow Diem, who was killed the next day together with his brother.\nDiem had followed a policy of \"deconstructing the state\" by creating a number of overlapping agencies and departments who were encouraged to feud with one another in order to disorganize the South Vietnamese state to such an extent that he hoped that it would make a coup against him impossible. When Diem was overthrown and killed, without any kind of arbiter between the rival arms of the South Vietnamese state, South Vietnam promptly disintegrated. The American Defense Secretary Robert McNamara reported after visiting South Vietnam in December 1963 that \"there is no organized government worthy of the name\" in Saigon. At a meeting of the plenum of the Politburo in December 1963, L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n's \"South first\" faction triumphed with the Politburo passing a resolution calling for North Vietnam to complete the overthrow of the regime in Saigon as soon as possible while the members of the \"North first\" faction were dismissed. As South Vietnam descended into chaos, whatever interest Ho might had in the French peace plan ended as it become clear it was possible for the Viet Cong to overthrow the government in Saigon. A CIA report from 1964 stated the factionalism in South Vietnam had reached \"almost the point of anarchy\" as various South Vietnamese leaders fought one another, making any sort of effort against the Viet Cong impossible, which was rapidly taking over much of the South Vietnamese countryside.As South Vietnam collapsed into factionalism and in-fighting while the Viet Cong continued to win the war, it became increasingly apparent to President Lyndon Johnson that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam. Though Johnson did not wish to commit American forces until he had won the 1964 election, he decided to make his intentions clear to Hanoi. In June 1964, the \"Seaborn Mission\" began as J. Blair Seaborn, the Canadian commissioner to the ICC, arrived in Hanoi with a message from Johnson offering billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition in exchange for which North Vietnam would cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn also warned that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing, saying that Johnson was seriously considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Little came of the back channel of the \"Seaborn Mission\" as the North Vietnamese distrusted Seaborn, who pointedly was never allowed to meet Ho.In late 1964, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) combat troops were sent southwest into officially neutral Laos and Cambodia. By March 1965, American combat troops began arriving in South Vietnam, first to protect the airbases around Chu Lai and Da Nang, later to take on most of the fight as \"[m]ore and more American troops were put in to replace Saigon troops who could not, or would not, get involved in the fighting\". As fighting escalated, widespread aerial and artillery bombardment all over North Vietnam by the United States Air Force and Navy began with Operation Rolling Thunder. On 8-9 April 1965, Ho made a secret visit to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. It was agreed that no Chinese combat troops would enter North Vietnam unless the United States invaded North Vietnam, but that China would send support troops to North Vietnam to help maintain the infrastructure damaged by American bombing. There was a deep distrust and fear of China within the North Vietnamese Politburo, and the suggestion that Chinese troops, even support troops, be allowed into North Vietnam, caused outrage in the Politburo. Ho had to use all his moral authority to obtain the Politburo's approval.According to Chen Jian, during the mid-to-late 1960s, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n permitted 320,000 Chinese volunteers into North Vietnam to help build infrastructure for the country, thereby freeing a similar number of PAVN personnel to go south. There are no sources from Vietnam, the United States, or the Soviet Union that confirm the number of Chinese troops stationed in North Vietnam. However, the Chinese government later admitted to sending 320,000 Chinese soldiers to Vietnam during the 1960s and spent over $20 billion to support Hanoi's regular North Vietnamese Army and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng guerrilla units.To counter the American bombing, the entire population of North Vietnam was mobilized for the war effort with vast teams of women being used to repair the damage done by the bombers, often at a speed that astonished the Americans. The bombing of North Vietnam proved to be the principle obstacle to opening peace talks as Ho repeatedly stated that no peace talks would be possible unless the United States unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam. Like many of the other leaders of the newly independent states of Asia and Africa, Ho was extremely sensitive about threats, whatever perceived or real, to his nation's independence and sovereignty. Ho regarded the American bombing as a violation of North Vietnam's sovereignty, and he felt that to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to bomb North Vietnam should he not behave as they wanted him to do, would diminish North Vietnam's independence.In March 1966, a Canadian diplomat, Chester Ronning, arrived in Hanoi with an offer to use his \"good offices\" to begin peace talks. However, the Ronning mission foundered upon the bombing issue, as the North Vietnamese demanded an unconditional halt to the bombing, an undertaking that Johnson refused to give. In June 1966, Janusz Lewandowski, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC, was able via d'Orlandi to see Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the American ambassador to South Vietnam, with an offer from Ho. Ho's offer for a \"political compromise\" as transmitted by Lewandowski included allowing South Vietnam to maintain its alliance with the U.S, instead of becoming neutral; having the Viet Cong \"take part\" in negotiations for a coalition government, instead being allowed to automatically enter a coalition government; and allowing a \"reasonable calendar\" for the withdrawal of American troops instead of an immediate withdrawal. Operation Marigold as the Lewandowski channel came to be code-named almost led to American-North Vietnamese talks in Warsaw in December 1966, but collapsed over the bombing issue.In January 1967, General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh, the commander of the forces in South Vietnam, returned to Hanoi, to present a plan that became the genesis of the Tet Offensive a year later. Thanh expressed much concern about the Americans invading Laos to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to preempt this possibility, urged an all-out offensive to win the war with a sudden blow. L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n supported Thanh's plans, which were stoutly opposed by the Defense Minister, General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, who preferred to continue with a guerrilla war, arguing that the superior American firepower would ensure the failure of Thanh's proposed offensive. With the Politburo divided, it was agreed to study and debate the issue more.In July 1967, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and most of the Politburo of the Communist Party met in a high-profile conference where they concluded the war had fallen into a stalemate. The American military presence forced the PAVN to expend the majority of their resources on maintaining the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail rather than reinforcing their comrade's ranks in the South. Ho seems to have agreed to Thanh's offensive because he wanted to see Vietnam reunified within his lifetime, and the increasingly ailing Ho was painfully aware that he did not have much time left. With Ho's permission, the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng planned a massive Tet Offensive that would commence on 31 January 1968, with the aim of taking much of the South by force and dealing a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of North Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\nIn early 1969, Ho suffered a heart attack and was in increasingly bad health for the rest of the year. In July 1969, Jean Sainteny, a former French official in Vietnam who knew Ho secretly transmitted a letter to him from President Richard Nixon. Nixon's letter proposed working together to end this \"tragic war\", but also warned that if North Vietnam made no concessions at the peace talks in Paris by 1 November, Nixon would resort to \"measures of great consequence and force\". Ho's reply, which Nixon received on 30 August 1969 made no concessions, as Nixon's threats apparently made no impression on him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot. His father was a scholar and teacher who received a high degree in the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty Imperial examination. H\u1ed3 was taught to master Classical Chinese at a young age. Before the August Revolution, he often wrote poetry in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n (the Vietnamese name for the Chinese writing system). One of those is Poems from the Prison Diary, written when he was imprisoned by the police of the Republic of China. This poetry chronicle is Vietnam National Treasure No. 10 and was translated into many languages. It is used in Vietnamese high schools. After Vietnam gained independence from France, the new government exclusively promoted Ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef (Vietnamese writing system in Latin characters) to eliminate illiteracy. H\u1ed3 started to create more poems in the modern Vietnamese language for dissemination to a wider range of readers. From when he became president until the appearance of serious health problems, a short poem of his was regularly published in the newspaper Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n T\u1ebft (Lunar new year) edition to encourage his people in working, studying or fighting Americans in the new year.\n\nBecause he was in exile for nearly 30 years, H\u1ed3 could speak fluently as well as read and write professionally in French, English, Russian, Cantonese and Mandarin as well as his mother tongue Vietnamese. In addition, he was reported to speak conversational Esperanto. In the 1920s, he was bureau chief/editor of many newspapers which he established to criticize French Colonial Government of Indochina and serving communism propaganda purposes. Examples are Le Paria (The Pariah) first published in Paris 1922 or Thanh Nien (Youth) first published on 21 June 1925 (21 June was named by The Socialist Republic of Vietnam Government as Vietnam Revolutionary Journalism Day). In many state official visits to Soviet Union and China, he often talked directly to their communist leaders without interpreters especially about top secret information. While being interviewed by Western journalists, he used French. His Vietnamese had a strong accent from his birthplace in the central province of Ngh\u1ec7 An, but could be widely understood throughout the country.As President, he held formal receptions for foreign heads of state and ambassadors at the Presidential Palace, but he personally did not live there. He ordered the building of a stilt house at the back of the palace, which is today known as the Presidential Palace Historical Site. His hobbies (according to his secretary V\u0169 K\u1ef3) included reading, gardening, feeding fish (many of which are still living) and visiting schools and children's homes.He is believed by some to have married Zeng Xueming, although only being able to live with her for less than a year.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh remained in Hanoi during his final years, demanding the unconditional withdrawal of all non-Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam. By 1969, with negotiations still dragging on, his health began to deteriorate from multiple health problems, including diabetes which prevented him from participating in further active politics. However, he insisted that his forces in the South continue fighting until all of Vietnam was reunited regardless of the length of time that it might take, believing that time was on his side.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nWith the outcome of the Vietnam War still in question, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh died of heart failure at his home in Hanoi at 9:47 on the morning of 2 September 1969; he was 79 years old. His embalmed body is currently on display in a mausoleum in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square in Hanoi despite his will which stated that he wanted to be cremated.The North Vietnamese government originally announced Ho's death as 3 September. A week of mourning for his death was decreed nationwide in North Vietnam from 4 to 11 September 1969. His funeral was attended by about 250,000 people and 5,000 official guests, which included many international mourners.\nAmong the dignitaries to attend were :\n\n Leader L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam\n President Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Th\u1ecd of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\n Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia\n Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma of Laos\n Premier Alexei Kosygin of the Soviet Union\n President Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia\n Deputy Premier Ignacy Loga-Sowi\u0144ski of Poland\n Politician Erich M\u00fcckenberger of East Germany\n Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer of Romania\n Vice President Li Xiannian of China\n General Secretary of the Communist Party Kenji Miyamoto of JapanRepresentatives from 40 countries and regions were also presented. During the mourning period, North Vietnam received more than 22,000 condolences letters from 20 organizations and 110 countries across the world, such as France, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Zambia, and many others, mostly Socialist countries.\nIt was said that Ho's body was hid, and carried a long way among forests and rivers in a special-designed coffin until Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum was built.\nHe was not initially replaced as president; instead a \"collective leadership\" composed of several ministers and military leaders took over, known as the Politburo. During North Vietnam's final campaign, a famous song written by composer Huy Thuc was often sung by PAVN soldiers: \"B\u00e1c v\u1eabn c\u00f9ng ch\u00fang ch\u00e1u h\u00e0nh qu\u00e2n\" (\"You are still marching with us, Uncle Ho\").During the Fall of Saigon in April 1975, several PAVN tanks displayed a poster with those same words on it. The day after the battle ended, on 1 May, veteran Australian journalist Denis Warner reported that \"When the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon yesterday, they were led by a man who wasn't there\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nHo Chi Minh remains one of the most divisive figures in modern contemporary history.\nThe Vietnamese Socialist Republic has sustained the personality cult of Uncle Ho (B\u00e1c H\u1ed3), the Bringer of Light (Ch\u00ed Minh). It is comparable in many ways to that of Mao Zedong in China and of Kim il-sung and Kim Jong-il in North Korea. There is the embalmed body on view in a massive mausoleum, the ubiquity of his image featured in every public building and schoolroom, and other displays of reverence, some unofficial, that verge on \"worship\". (Ho Chi Minh's image appears on some family altars, and there is at least one temple dedicated to him, built in then-Vi\u1ec7t-C\u1ed9ng-controlled V\u0129nh Long shortly after his death in 1970).\n\nIn The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam (1982) Duiker suggests that the cult of Ho Chi Minh is indicative of a larger legacy, one that drew on \"elements traditional to the exercise of control and authority in Vietnamese society.\" Duiker is drawn to an \"irresistible and persuasive\" comparison with China. As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Ho Chi Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule Cochinchina) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".\n\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of Confucianism, condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (gia truong). The socialist conception of social equality destroyed the Confucian views of class.\n\nYet Duiker argues many were to find the new ideology \"congenial\" precisely because of its similarities with the teachings of the old Master: \"the belief in one truth, embodied in quasi-sacred texts\"; in \"an anointed elite, trained in an all-embracing doctrine and responsible for leading the broad masses and indoctrinating them in proper thought and behavior\"; in \"the subordination of the individual to the community\"; and in the perfectibility, through corrective action, of human nature. All of this, Duiker suggests, was in some manner present in the aura of the new Master, Chi Minh, \"the bringer of light,\" \"Uncle Ho\" to whom \"all the desirable qualities of Confucian ethics\" are ascribed. Under Ho Chi Minh, Vietnamese Marxism developed, in effect, as a kind of \"reformed Confucianism\" revised to meet \"the challenges of the modern era\" and, not least among these, of \"total mobilisation in the struggle for national independence and state power.\"This \"congeniality\" with Confucian tradition was remarked on by Nguyen Khac Vien, a leading Hanoi intellectual of the 1960 and 70s. In Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam Nguyen Khac Vien, saw definite parallels between Confucian and party discipline, between the traditional scholar gentry and Ho Chi Minh's party cadres.A completely different form of the cult of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (and one tolerated by the government with some uneasiness) is his identification in Vietnamese folk religion with the Jade Emperor, who supposedly incarnated again on earth as H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. Today H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums. The first such medium was one Madam Lang in the 1990s, but the cult acquired a significant number of followers through another medium, Madam Xoan. She established on 1 January 2001 \u0110\u1ea1o Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u1eadt H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (the Way of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Buddha) also known as \u0110\u1ea1o B\u00e1c H\u1ed3 (the Way of Uncle H\u1ed3) at \u0111\u1ec1n H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (the Peace Temple) in Ch\u00ed Linh-Sao \u0110\u1ecf district of H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng province. She then founded the Peace Society of Heavenly Mediums (\u0110o\u00e0n \u0111\u1ed3ng thi\u00ean H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh). Reportedly, by 2014 the movement had around 24,000 followers.Yet even when the Vietnamese government's attempt to immortalize Ho Chi Minh was also met with significant controversies and opposition. The regime is sensitive to anything that might question the official hagiography. This includes references to Ho Chi Minh's personal life that might detract from the image of the dedicated \"the father of the revolution\", the \"celibate married only to the cause of revolution\". William Duiker's Ho Chi Minh: A Life (2000) was candid on the matter of Ho Chi Minh's liaisons. The government sought cuts in a Vietnamese translation and banned distribution of an issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review which carried a small item about the controversy.There has been a number of criticisms against him, where his role on the land reforms had led to the death of more than 172,000 people. A large number of Vietnamese, mostly from diaspora communities and those who still live in modern Southern Vietnam, which have strongly opposed the communist government, considered Ho Chi Minh as a leader who led Vietnam to suffer total destruction and a brutal campaign in terrors accordance to communist terrorism, including the instigation of Vietnam War that led to the complete destruction of Vietnamese nation. These claims have received enormous support from the anti-communist and anti-totalitarian groups across the world, which saw Ho Chi Minh, using the mask of \"liberation\", initiated a complete cultural and human genocide inside the country. These claims have been denied by the communist government.\nHo Chi Minh was listed as one of the war criminals in The Black Book of Communism, where he was accused of killing one million Vietnamese.\n\n\n== International influence ==\n\n \nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh is considered one of the most influential leaders in the world. Time magazine listed him in the list of 100 Most Important People of the Twentieth Century (Time 100) in 1998. His thought and revolution inspired many leaders and people on a global scale in Asia, Africa and Latin America during the decolonization movement which occurred after World War II. As a communist, he was one of the international figures who were highly praised in the Communist world.Various places, boulevards and squares are named after him around the world, especially in Socialist states and former Communist states. In Russia, there is a H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square and monument in Moscow, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh boulevard in Saint Petersburg and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square in Ulyanovsk (the birthplace of Vladimir Lenin, a sister city of Vinh, the birthplace of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh). During the Vietnam War the then West Bengal government, in the hands of CPI(M), renamed Harrington Street to Ho Chi Minh Sarani, which is also the location of the Consulate General of the United States of America in Kolkata. According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as many as 20 countries across Asia, Europe, America and Africa have erected statues in remembrance of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh.Busts, statues and memorial plaques and exhibitions are displayed in destinations on his extensive world journey in exile from 1911 to 1941 including France, Great Britain, Russia, China and Thailand.Many activists and musicians wrote songs about H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his revolution in different languages during the Vietnam War to demonstrate against the United States. Spanish songs were composed by F\u00e9lix Pita Rodr\u00edguez, Carlos Puebla and Al\u00ed Primera. In addition, the Chilean folk singer V\u00edctor Jara referenced H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh in his anti-war song \"El derecho de vivir en paz\" (\"The Right to Live in Peace\"). In English, Ewan MacColl wrote \"The Ballad of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh\" and Pete Seeger wrote \"Teacher Uncle Ho\". Russian songs about him were written by Vladimir Fere and German songs about him were written by Kurt Demmler.\nIn 1987, UNESCO officially recommended that its member states \"join in the commemoration of the centenary of the birth of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh by organizing various events as a tribute to his memory\", considering \"the important and many-sided contributions of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to the fields of culture, education and the arts\" who \"devoted his whole life to the national liberation of the Vietnamese people, contributing to the common struggle of peoples for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Essays ===\nBernard B.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh Thought, or Ho Chi Minh Ideology, (Vietnamese: T\u01b0 t\u01b0\u1edfng H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh) is a political philosophy that builds upon Marxism\u2013Leninism and the ideology of Ho Chi Minh. It was first formalised by the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1991. Ho Chi Minh Thought is a broad term for political theories and policies that are seen by their proponents as representing Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to Vietnamese circumstances and specific time periods. The ideology includes views on the basic issues of the Vietnamese Revolution, specifically the application and development of Marxism-Leninism to the material conditions of Vietnam. The contents of Ho Chi Minh Thought was codified and developed by the Communist Party of Vietnam.\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam defines Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought as a guideline for all actions and victories of the Vietnamese revolution. Ho Chi Minh Thought, while named after the Vietnamese revolutionary and President, does not necessarily reflect the ideology of Ho Chi Minh, rather Ho Chi Minh Thought refers to the official ideology of the Communist Party of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nHo Chi Minh Thought was influenced by Vietnamese culture, the French revolution, and Marxism\u2013Leninism. Similar to Maoism, at the core of Ho Chi Minh Thought is that the peasantry is the revolutionary vanguard in pre-industrial societies, rather than the proletariat.Ho Chi Minh Thought is rooted in:\nMarxism-Leninism\nTraditional Vietnamese ideology and culture\nEastern cultural thought: Confucianism, Buddhism\nWestern ideologies, specifically French and American political philosophy\nHo Chi Minh 's personal morality\n\n\n=== Influence of Confucianism ===\nHo Chi Minh, the son of a Confucian scholar, studied Confucianism throughout his life and was a strong critic of Confucian ethics and ideals. Despite this public criticism, scholars have argued that Confucianism remains part of both the personal ideology of Ho Chi Minh, and within Ho Chi Minh Thought, arguing that Confucian morality and the principle of self-cultivation are a central part of the party's platform and the ideology of Ho Chi Minh Thought. The Communist Party rejects this, arguing that this proposition is a distortion of the historical record of both Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Party of Vietnam.Summarizing 30 years of studying Confucianism, Ho Chi Minh concluded:\n\nH\u1ecdc thuy\u1ebft c\u1ee7a Kh\u1ed5ng T\u1eed c\u00f3 \u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec3m c\u1ee7a n\u00f3 l\u00e0 s\u1ef1 tu d\u01b0\u1ee1ng \u0111\u1ea1o \u0111\u1ee9c c\u00e1 nh\u00e2n.

The religion of Jesus has its advantage of great kindness. Marxism has its advantage of a dialectical method. The tenets of Sun Yat-sen has its advantages, its policy being suitable with our country's conditions. Confucius, Jesus, Marx, Sun Yat-sen, what advantage did they share in common? They all want happiness for everyone, striving for the welfare of society. If they were still alive in this world today, if they had gathered together, I believe they would definitely live together perfectly as close friends. I try to be their little student.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nHo Chi Minh Thought, as codified by the Communist Party of Vietnam, describes the following as the core of ideological system of Ho Chi Minh Thought:\n\nNational liberation, class liberation, human liberation;\nNational independence\nNational Unity\nPeople's ownership, building the true State of the people, by the people, for the people;\nNational defense of all people, building of the people's armed forces;\nEconomic and cultural development, constantly improving the material and spiritual life of the people;\nRevolutionary ethics needs, thrifty, integrity, righteousness and impartiality;\nTake care of fostering revolutionary generations for the next life;\nBuilding a clean, strong Party, cadres and party members who are both leaders and loyal servants of the peopleCentral to Ho Chi Minh Thought is the importance of the Communist Party being the center of a national liberation movement. Ho Chi Minh Thought argues that revolutionary violence and humanitarian peace are dialectical opposed to each other, however the synthesis of their conflict would inevitably be the preservation of peace, independence and national liberation.Related to socialism and economics, Ho Chi Minh Thought details the following about socialist construction and characteristics of a socialist society and economy:\nSocialism is a society with highly developed production force, associated with the progressive development of science - technology and culture, the rich, and the strong country.\nImplementation of workers ownership of the means of production and implementing the principle of labor distribution.\nA dictatorship of the proletariat based on the unity of industrial, agricultural, and intellectual workers under the leadership of the Communist Party.\nA socialist society has a system of social relations that is healthy, fair and equal, with no opposition between intellectual and manual labor, and between urban and rural areas.We must develop the state-owned economic sector to create the material basis for socialism and promote socialist reform.\nHo Chi Minh Thought emphasizes a gradual transition to socialism. Similar to Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, Ho Chi Minh Thought places emphasis on the role of the development of the productive forces towards the development of socialism. According to Ho Chi Minh, when entering the period of transition to socialism, the Vietnamese economy was described as a largely outdated agricultural economy that had not yet underwent capitalist development. In particular, Ho Chi Minh paid special attention to the fundamental contradiction of the transition period, which is the conflict between the country's high development needs and the socio-economic situation of the working class. Ho Chi Minh Thought also stresses learning from the experiences of other socialist countries in building Socialism and make use of all the help of international aid and cooperation.While H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh supported the position that Vietnam had entered the stage of transition to socialism in 1954, he held the belief that Vietnam was still \"a democratic regime in which people are the masters\" and not socialist. To reach the socialist stage of development, the development of the state sector was of utmost importance\u2014the lack of which according to H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh would lead to failure. The platform of the 11th National Congress held in January 2011 stated: \"This is a profound and thorough revolutionary process and a complicated struggle between the old and the new for qualitative changes in all aspects of social life. It is essential to undergo a long period of transition with several steps of development and several mixed social and economic structures\".\n\nAccording to the party's General Secretary Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng, during the transition to socialism, socialist factors of development compete with non-socialist factors, which include capitalist factors. Nguy\u1ec5n said: \"Along with positive aspects, there will always be negative aspects and challenges that need to be considered wisely and dealt with timely and effectively. It is a difficult struggle that requires spirit, fresh vision, and creativity. The path to socialism is a process of constantly consolidating and strengthening socialist factors to make them more dominant and irreversible. Success will depend on correct policies, political spirit, leadership capacity, and the fighting strength of the Party\".\n\n\n== Morality ==\nA unique aspect of Ho Chi Minh thought is the emphasis on personal morality and ethics. The personal values of Ho Chi Minh are regularly upheld by the Party, and party members are taught to exemplify Ho Chi Minh's personal values: practicing the standard of industriousness, thrift, integrity, uprightness, public-spiritedness and selflessness in serving the country and the people. Central to Ho Chi Minh morality is living a modest and immaterial lifestyle, and devoting oneself to the collective good and the advancement of socialism and self-determination. Ho Chi Minh wrote about morality throughout his entire life, and often criticized individualism, such as in his short essay Raise up Revolutionary Ethics, Eliminate Individuals. The personal values of Ho Chi Minh are a mandatory party of school curriculum throughout Vietnam.\n\n\n== Development ==\nAt the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam held in Hanoi in 1991, it was determined that Marxism - Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought were the basis of the ideology of the Party. Since this congress, Ho Chi Minh Thought has been taught in all universities as a compulsory subject for all students of all disciplines. The formal training - and discussion between experts - for this course began in 1997 at Hanoi University.Domestic researchers and Ho Chi Minh's comrades have written many works on Ho Chi Minh Thought such as Understanding some issues in Ho Chi Minh's thought (1982) by Le Mau Han. ; Ho Chi Minh Thought Research (1993) by the Ho Chi Minh Institute's authors; The world has changed but Ho Chi Minh thought (1991), Ho Chi Minh thought (1993), Ho Chi Minh thought process of formation and development (1993), Ho Chi Minh thought and the way Vietnamese revolution (1997) of Vo Nguyen Giap ; Basic perceptions about Ho Chi Minh thought (1998) of Pham Van Dong ; The formation of Ho Chi Minh ideology (1997) by Tran Van Giau ; From traditional thinking to Ho Chi Minh thought (1998) by Hoang Tung.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunism in Vietnam\nJuche\nMaoism\nPrimary stage of socialism\nVietnamese nationalism\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants).

As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%.

The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese. Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam. Although the city takes up just 0.6% of the country's land area, it contains 8.34% of the population of Vietnam, 20.2% of its GDP, 27.9% of industrial output and 34.9% of the FDI projects in the country in 2005.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "The Amazing Race Vietnam: Cu\u1ed9c \u0111ua k\u1ef3 th\u00fa 2019 is the sixth season of the reality television game show, The Amazing Race Vietnam. It featured ten teams of two celebrities in a race around Vietnam for 300 million\u20ab.\nThe season premiered on July 7, 2019 on VTV3 and aired every Saturday (20:00 UTC+7).Singer and The Voice of Vietnam contestant Song Lu\u00e2n as well as singer and former racer H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang hosted this season replacing Huy Kh\u00e1nh.\nBeauty queens \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7 H\u1eb1ng and H'Hen Ni\u00ea were the winners of this season.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and filming ===\n\nIn May 2019, rumors circulated that VTV3 and BHD were attempting to revive the Race franchise after a three year hiatus from the previous season. Soon after, open casting calls for a new season of The Amazing Race Vietnam appeared. Filming for this season began on May 17, 2019, when fans of the show spotted the racers in H\u00e0 Giang Province.On May 28, 2019, Season 3 winner and Season 5 runner-up H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang posted an image of a Race clue envelope onto her social media leading to speculation that she would appear on the season. Later that day, images surfaced of H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang checking teams into the Pit Stop in Da Lat. It was later revealed that H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang would be temporarily talking over the role of host due to Song Lu\u00e2n having work commitments. H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang is the second former racer that returned to host the show after Toya Montoya, who hosted two seasons of the Latin American edition after competing on the third season, as well as the third woman, after Toya Montoya and Tara Basro, and the first member of the transgender community to serve as a Race host. This season is also the second time a show has changed hosts partway through filming after the first season of the Chinese edition. H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang also made an appearance during Leg 3 as a judge in one of the challenges.\nOn June 2, 2019, the revival of the show was officially announced on the show's Facebook page prior to the completion of the season's filming.This season was the first time that an Amazing Race franchise visited North Korea, a country the original American edition can't visit due to the prohibition of American travelers to the nation implemented after the death of Otto Warmbier, as the international destination for the season and was the first foreign reality show to film inside the nation.This season featured a new twist on the Express Pass. The recipients of the Express Pass could either use it to skip a task of their choosing or use it to save a team from elimination, much like the Salvage Pass. It was subsequently used to save a team during the series's first instance of a Double Elimination. Also, much like the previous season, teams departed the Pit Stop in five-minute intervals instead of the actual time difference between check-ins, similar to the Chinese celebrity series.\nDuring Leg 6, one task involved teams scuba diving to find a concrete slab puzzle placed on top of a coral reef. Viewers along with The Amazing Race Vietnam 2015 winner and diving coach Ng\u1ecdc Anh complaining that the task was damaging to a fragile ecosystem. The producers of the show later issued an apology stating that the original intention of the task was for teams to swim through the reef to a strip of sand (murky water conditions near the sand strip also forced them to move the puzzle to the reef in order to see the puzzle clearly), where they would find the puzzle, and assured viewers that a similar setup would not occur in the future.For the first time in the franchise's history, four teams raced to the Finish Line in the final leg of the Race. Four teams raced on the final legs of Season 25 and Season 26 of the American edition; unlike the former, a fourth team was eliminated early in the leg before reaching the Finish Line.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn June 6, 2019, the cast was officially announced. This season's cast included Miss Universe Vietnam 2017 H'Hen Ni\u00ea, Miss Universe Vietnam 2015 runner-up \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7 H\u1eb1ng, Miss Vietnam 2014 Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 Duy\u00ean, actor B\u00ecnh An, Vietnam Idol Season 2 winner Qu\u1ed1c Thi\u00ean, Miss Vietnam 2016 \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1ef9 Linh, and model L\u00ea Xu\u00e2n Ti\u1ec1n. Singer S.T S\u01a1n Th\u1ea1ch previously competed on The Amazing Race Vietnam 2013 with stuntman L\u00e2m H\u00f9ng Phong but was part of the first team eliminated.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nSting Energy Drink, the primary sponsor of the previous seasons, returned for this season. TikTok and Vingroup also came on as sponsors.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe following teams participated in the Race, with their relationships at the time of filming and designated team colors.

        "wiki": "Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn (listen, Chinese:\u5824\u5cb8), usually Anglicized as \"Cholon\" in English sources, is a quarter of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It lies on the west bank of the Saigon River, having B\u00ecnh T\u00e2y Market as its central market. Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn consists of the western half of District 5 as well as several adjoining neighborhoods in District 6 and  District 11. The quarter has long been inhabited by Chinese people, and is considered the largest Chinatown in the world by area. \nThe Vietnamese name Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn literally means \"big\" (l\u1edbn) \"market\" (ch\u1ee3). The Chinese name (and original name) is \u5824\u5cb8 (pronounced Tai-Ngon in Cantonese and D\u012b'\u00e0n in Mandarin, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais). The Vietnamese reading of the Chinese name is \u0110\u00ea Ng\u1ea1n, but this is rarely used. Vietnamese speakers exclusively use the name Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, while Chinese speakers (both inside Vietnam and in China) are the only users of the original Chinese name.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nThe city of Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn was established by the Hoa community. The L\u00ea dynasty which was the ruling family in the sixteenth century began to decline in power and two rival families, the Trinh and Nguyen families began to vie for power to fill in the void of the L\u00ea. Nguyen was then appointed as Viceroy of the South with headquarters at Hu\u1ebf where they encouraged Chinese immigration to settle down into the area.In 1778, H\u00f2a living in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a had to take refuge in what is now Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn because they were retaliated against by the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n forces for their support of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords. In 1782, more than 10,000 H\u00f2a were again massacred by the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n and had to rebuild. They built high embankments against the flows of the river, and called their new settlement Tai-Ngon (meaning \"embankment\" in Cantonese).\nCh\u1ee3 L\u1edbn was incorporated as a city in 1879, 11 km from Saigon. By the 1930s, it had expanded to the city limit of Saigon. On 27 April 1931, Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn and the neighbouring city Sa\u00efgon were merged to form a single city called \u2018Saigon\u2013Cholon\u2019. The official name, however, never entered everyday vernacular and the city continued to be referred to as \u2018Saigon\u2019. \u2018Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn\u2019 was dropped from the city's official name in 1956, after Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955.During the Vietnam War, soldiers and deserters from the United States Army maintained a thriving black market at Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, trading in various American and especially U.S Army-issue items.  This was the area, near the Quan \u00c2m Pagoda where photojournalist Eddie Adams took his famous execution photograph. Four Australian journalists were also killed in Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn during the Tet Offensive in 1968.Today, Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn attracts many tourists, especially mainland Chinese and Taiwanese.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nYvon Petra - He was born in Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn.

        "wiki": "H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (; Vietnamese: [h\u00f2 c\u01d0 m\u012b\u014b\u031f] (listen), Saigon: [h\u00f2 c\u01d0 m\u0268\u0304n]; Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m: \u80e1\u5fd7\u660e; 19 May 1890 \u2013 2 September 1969), born Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung, also known as Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c, B\u00e1c H\u1ed3, or simply B\u00e1c ('Uncle', pronounced [\u0294\u0253a\u02d0k\u031a\u02e6\u02e5]), was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician. He served as Prime Minister of Vietnam from 1945 to 1955 and President from 1945 to 1969. Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist, he served as Chairman and First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Vietnam.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh led the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the Communist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, ending the First Indochina War. He was a key figure in the People's Army of Vietnam and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng during the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975. Democratic Republic of Vietnam was victorious against the United States and was reunified with the Republic of South Vietnam in 1976. Saigon, the former capital of South Vietnam, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honor. Ho officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems and died in 1969.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's life before he came to power in Vietnam is ambiguous. He is known to have used between 50 to 200 pseudonyms. His birth is subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely.Aside from being a politician, Ho was also a writer, a poet and a journalist. He wrote several books, articles and poems in French, Chinese and Vietnamese.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was born as Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung in 1890 in the village of Ho\u00e0ng Tr\u00f9 (the name of the local temple near L\u00e0ng Sen), his mother's village. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years: 1891, 1892, 1894 and 1895. From 1895, he grew up in his father Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh S\u1eafc (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Huy)'s village of L\u00e0ng Sen, Kim Li\u00ean, Nam \u0110\u00e0n, and Ngh\u1ec7 An Province. He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the French Army; his brother Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a geomancer and traditional herbalist; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Ho) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. He quickly mastered Chinese writing, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism, while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing. In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name at the age of 10: Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Accomplished\").\nHis father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe (Qui Nh\u01a1n). He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the cane as punishment for an infraction. His father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy, but he refused because it meant serving the French. This exposed Th\u00e0nh (Ho) to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province. Nevertheless, he received a French education, attending Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc (lyc\u00e9e or secondary education) in Hu\u1ebf. His disciples, Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, also attended the school, as did Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the future President of South Vietnam (and political rival).\n\n\n=== First sojourn in France ===\nPreviously, it was believed that Th\u00e0nh (Ho) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-corv\u00e9e) demonstration of poor peasants in Hu\u1ebf in May 1908, which endangered his student status at Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc. However, a document from the Centre des archives d'Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-corv\u00e9e demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908). The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese Communist leaders, as shown in North Vietnamese President T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng's falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea revolt.\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged, but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at D\u1ee5c Thanh school in Phan Thi\u1ebft for about six months, then traveled to Saigon.He worked as a kitchen helper on a French steamer, the Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville, using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in Marseille, France on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for Le Havre and Dunkirk, returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School, but his application was rejected. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from 1911 to 1917.\n\n\n=== In the United States ===\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City (Harlem) and Boston, where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the Parker House Hotel. The only evidence that he was in the United States is a letter to French colonial administrators dated 15 December 1912 and postmarked New York City (he gave as his address Poste Restante in Le Havre and his occupation as a sailor) and a postcard to Phan Chu Trinh in Paris where he mentioned working at the Parker House Hotel. Inquiries to the Parker House management revealed no records of his ever having worked there. Among a series of menial jobs, he claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in Brooklyn between 1917 and 1918 and for General Motors as a line manager. It is believed that while in the United States he made contact with Korean nationalists, an experience that developed his political outlook. Sophie Quinn-Judge states that this is \"in the realm of conjecture\". He was also influenced by Pan-Africanist and Black nationalist Marcus Garvey during his stay and said he attended meetings of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\n\n\n=== In Britain ===\n\nAt various points between 1913 and 1919, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) claimed to have lived in West Ealing and later in Crouch End, Hornsey. He reportedly worked as either a chef or dish washer (reports vary) at the Drayton Court Hotel in West Ealing. Claims that he trained as a pastry chef under Auguste Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, Westminster are not supported by documentary evidence. The wall of New Zealand House, home of the New Zealand High Commission, which now stands on the site of the Carlton Hotel, displays a blue plaque. During 1913, Th\u00e0nh was also employed as a pastry chef on the Newhaven\u2013Dieppe ferry route.\n\n\n== Political education in France ==\n\nFrom 1919 to 1923, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) began to show an interest in politics while living in France, being influenced by his friend and Socialist Party of France comrade Marcel Cachin. Th\u00e0nh claimed to have arrived in Paris from London in 1917, but the French police only had documents recording his arrival in June 1919. In Paris he joined the Groupe des Patriotes Annamites (The Group of Vietnamese Patriots) that included Phan Chu Trinh, Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ebf Truy\u1ec1n and Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh. They had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for Vietnamese independence under the pseudonym Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Patriot\") prior to Th\u00e0nh's arrival in Paris. The group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the Vietnamese people in French Indochina to the Western powers at the Versailles peace talks, but they were ignored. Citing the principle of self-determination outlined prior to the peace accords, they requested the allied powers to end French colonial rule of Vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government.\nPrior to the conference, the group sent their letter to allied leaders, including Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and President Woodrow Wilson. They were unable to obtain consideration at Versailles, but the episode would later help establish the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the symbolic leader of the anti-colonial movement at home in Vietnam. Since Th\u00e0nh was the public face behind the publication of the document (although it was written by Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng), he soon became known as Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c and first used the name in September during an interview with a Chinese newspaper correspondent.Many authors have stated that 1919 was a lost \"Wilsonian moment\", where the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh could have adopted a pro-American and less radical position if only President Wilson had received him. However, at the time of the Versailles Conference, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was committed to a socialist program. While the conference was ongoing, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c was already delivering speeches on the prospects of Bolshevism in Asia and was attempting to persuade French Socialists to join Lenin's Communist International.In December 1920, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) became a representative to the Congress of Tours of the Socialist Party of France, voted for the Third International and was a founding member of the French Communist Party. Taking a position in the Colonial Committee of the party, he tried to draw his comrades' attention towards people in French colonies including Indochina, but his efforts were often unsuccessful. While living in Paris, he reportedly had a relationship with a dressmaker named Marie Bri\u00e8re. As discovered in 2018, Qu\u1ed1c also had relations with the members of Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea like Kim Kyu-sik while in Paris.During this period, he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as running his Vietnamese nationalist group. In May 1922, he wrote an article for a French magazine criticizing the use of English words by French sportswriters. The article implored Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 to outlaw such Franglais as le manager, le round and le knock-out. His articles and speeches caught the attention of Dmitry Manuilsky, who would soon sponsor his trip to the Soviet Union and under whose tutelage he would become a high-ranking member of the Soviet Comintern.\n\n\n== In the Soviet Union and China ==\n\nIn 1923, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) left Paris for Moscow carrying a passport with the name Chen Vang, a Chinese merchant, where he was employed by the Comintern, studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East and participated in the Fifth Comintern Congress in June 1924 before arriving in Canton (present-day Guangzhou), China in November 1924 using the name Ly Thuy.\nIn 1925\u20131926, he organized \"Youth Education Classes\" and occasionally gave socialist lectures to Vietnamese revolutionary young people living in Canton at the Whampoa Military Academy. These young people would become the seeds of a new revolutionary, pro-communist movement in Vietnam several years later. According to William Duiker, he lived with a Chinese woman, Zeng Xueming (T\u0103ng Tuy\u1ebft Minh), whom he married on 18 October 1926. When his comrades objected to the match, he told them: \"I will get married despite your disapproval because I need a woman to teach me the language and keep house\". She was 21 and he was 36. They married in the same place where Zhou Enlai had married earlier and then lived in the residence of a Comintern agent, Mikhail Borodin.Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Ch\u00ed argued that in June 1925 he betrayed Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, the famous leader of a rival revolutionary faction and his father's old friend, to French Secret Service agents in Shanghai for 100,000 piastres. A source states that he later claimed he did it because he expected Ch\u00e2u's trial to stir up anti-French sentiment and because he needed the money to establish a communist organization. In Ho Chi Minh: A Life, William Duiker considered this hypothesis, but ultimately rejected it. Other sources claim that Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Huy\u1ec7n was responsible for Chau's capture. Chau, sentenced to lifetime house arrest, never denounced Qu\u1ed1c.\nAfter Chiang Kai-shek's 1927 anti-Communist coup, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) left Canton again in April 1927 and returned to Moscow, spending part of the summer of 1927 recuperating from tuberculosis in Crimea before returning to Paris once more in November. He then returned to Asia by way of Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland and Italy, where he sailed to Bangkok, Thailand, arriving in July 1928. \"Although we have been separated for almost a year, our feelings for each other do not have to be said to be felt\", he reassured Minh in an intercepted letter. In this period, he served as a senior agent undertaking Comintern activities in Southeast Asia.\n\nQu\u1ed1c (Ho) remained in Thailand, staying in the Thai village of Nachok until late 1929, when he moved on to India and then Shanghai. In Hong Kong in early 1930, he chaired a meeting with representatives from two Vietnamese Communist parties to merge them into a unified organization, the Communist Party of Vietnam. In June 1931, he was arrested. To reduce French pressure for extradition, he was reported as dead in 1932. The British quietly released him in January 1933. He moved to the Soviet Union and in Moscow studied and taught at the Lenin Institute. In this period he reportedly lost his positions in the Comintern because of a concern that he had betrayed the organization. However, according to Ton That Thien's research, he was a member of the inner circle of the Comintern, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Dmitry Manuilsky and a member in good standing of the Comintern throughout the Great Purge.In 1938, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) returned to China and served as an advisor to the Chinese Communist armed forces. He was also the senior Comintern agent in charge of Asian affairs. He worked extensively in Chungking and traveled to Guiyang, Kunming and Guilin. He was using the name H\u1ed3 Quang during this period.\n\n\n== Independence movement ==\nIn 1941, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement. The Japanese occupation of Indochina that year, the first step toward invasion of the rest of Southeast Asia, created an opportunity for patriotic Vietnamese. The so-called \"men in black\" were a 10,000 member guerrilla force that operated with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. He oversaw many successful military actions against the Vichy France and Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II, supported closely yet clandestinely by the United States Office of Strategic Services and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946\u20131954). He was jailed in China by Chiang Kai-shek's local authorities before being rescued by Chinese Communists. Following his release in 1943, he returned to Vietnam. It was during this time that he began regularly using the name H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, a Vietnamese name combining a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"Bright spirit\" or \"Clear will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e: Ch\u00ed meaning \"will\" or \"spirit\" and Minh meaning \"bright\"). His new name is a tribute to General Hou Zhiming (\u4faf\u5fd7\u660e), Chief Commissar of the 4th Military Region of the National Revolutionary Army, who helped releasing him from KMT prison in 1943.\n\nIn April 1945, he met with the OSS agent Archimedes Patti and offered to provide intelligence to the allies provided that he could have \"a line of communication\" with the Allies. The OSS agreed to this and later sent a military team of OSS members to train his men and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh himself was treated for malaria and dysentery by an OSS doctor.Following the August Revolution (1945) organized by the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became Chairman of the Provisional Government (Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although he convinced Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to abdicate, his government was not recognized by any country. He repeatedly petitioned President Harry S. Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.In 1946, future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became acquainted when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. He offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam. Ben-Gurion declined, telling him: \"I am certain we shall be able to establish a Jewish Government in Palestine\".In 1946, when he traveled outside of the country, his subordinates imprisoned 2,500 non-Communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed or exiled in July 1946, notably members of the Nationalist Party of Vietnam and the Dai Viet National Party after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the Viet Minh government. All rival political parties were hereafter banned and local governments were purged to minimize opposition later on. However, it was noted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's first Congress had over two-thirds of its members come from non-Vi\u1ec7t Minh political factions, some without an election. Nationalist Party of Vietnam leader Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ea3i Th\u1ea7n was named vice president. They also held four out of ten ministerial positions.\n\n\n=== Birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ===\nFollowing Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication on 2 September 1945, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh read the Declaration of Independence of Vietnam under the name of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In Saigon, with violence between rival Vietnamese factions and French forces increasing, the British commander, General Sir Douglas Gracey, declared martial law. On 24 September, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh leaders responded with a call for a general strike.In September 1945, a force of 200,000 Republic of China Army troops arrived in Hanoi to accept the surrender of the Japanese occupiers in northern Indochina. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh made a compromise with their general, Lu Han, to dissolve the Communist Party and to hold an election which would yield a coalition government. When Chiang forced the French to give the French concessions in Shanghai back to China in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina, he had no choice but to sign an agreement with France on 6 March 1946 in which Vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union. The agreement soon broke down. The purpose of the agreement, for both the French and Vietminh, was for Chiang's army to leave North Vietnam. Fighting broke out in the North soon after the Chinese left.\nHistorian Professor Liam Kelley of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on his Le Minh Khai's SEAsian History Blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh said he \"would rather smell French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for a thousand,\" noting that Stanley Karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to him in his 1983 Vietnam: A History and that the original quote was most likely forged by the Frenchman Paul Mus in his 1952 book Vietnam: Sociologie d'une Guerre. Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam (although this was the time when China invaded Tibet). The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.\n\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of the Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946, and of the Trotskyists. Trotskyism in Vietnam did not rival the Party outside of the major cities, but particularly in the South, in Saigon-Cochinchina, they had been a challenge. From the outset, they had called for armed resistance to a French restoration and for an immediate transfer of industry to workers and land to peasants. The French Socialist leader Daniel Guerin recalls that when in Paris in 1946 he asked H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh about the fate of the Trotskyist leader T\u1ea1 Thu Th\u00e2u, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh had replied, \"with unfeigned emotion,\" that \"Th\u00e2u was a great patriot and we mourn him, but then a moment later added in a steady voice \u2018All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.\u2019\"The Communists eventually suppressed all non-Communist parties, but they failed to secure a peace deal with France. In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the Dalat and Fontainebleau conferences, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by French forces at Hanoi only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The bombardment of Haiphong reportedly killed more than 6000 Vietnamese civilians. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Ho Chi Minh declared war against the French Union, marking the beginning of the Indochina War. The Vietnam National Army, mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked. They assaulted the French positions, smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper, destroying armored vehicles with \"lunge mines\" (a hollow-charge warhead on the end of a pole, detonated by thrusting the charge against the side of a tank; typically a suicide weapon) and Molotov cocktails, holding off attackers by using roadblocks, landmines and gravel. After two months of fighting, the exhausted Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces withdrew after systematically destroying any valuable infrastructure. Ho was reported to be captured by a group of French soldiers led by Jean-\u00c9tienne Valluy at Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc in Operation Lea. The person in question turned out to be a Vi\u1ec7t Minh advisor who was killed trying to escape.\nAccording to journalist Bernard Fall, Ho decided to negotiate a truce after fighting the French for several years. When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Ho expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of a number of Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.In February 1950, after the successful removal of the French border blockade, he met with Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in Moscow after the Soviet Union recognized his government. They all agreed that China would be responsible for backing the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. Mao Zedong's emissary to Moscow stated in August that China planned to train 60,000\u201370,000 Viet Minh in the near future. The road to the outside world was open for Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces to receive additional supplies which would allow them to escalate the fight against the French regime throughout Indochina. At the outset of the conflict, Ho reportedly told a French visitor: \"You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and I will win\". In 1954, the First Indochina War came to an end after the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu, where more than 10,000 French soldiers surrendered to the Viet Minh. The subsequent Geneva Accords peace process partitioned North Vietnam at the 17th parallel.\nArthur Dommen estimates that the Vi\u1ec7t Minh killed between 50,000 and 100,000 civilians during the war. However, Smedberg estimates that there were less than 150,000 civilian casualties. By comparison to Dommen's calculation, Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000\u2013250,000 civilian deaths.\n\n\n== Becoming president ==\n\nThe 1954 Geneva Accords concluded between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, allowing the latter's forces to regroup in the North whilst anti-Communist groups settled in the South. His Democratic Republic of Vietnam relocated to Hanoi and became the government of North Vietnam, a Communist-led one-party state. Following the Geneva Accords, there was to be a 300-day period in which people could freely move between the two regions of Vietnam, later known as South Vietnam and North Vietnam. During the 300 days, Di\u1ec7m and CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Di\u1ec7m's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan \"God has gone south\". Between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people migrated to the South, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Di\u1ec7m in temporary control of the South.All the parties at Geneva called for reunification elections, but they could not agree on the details. Recently appointed Vi\u1ec7t Minh acting foreign minister Pham Van Dong proposed elections under the supervision of \"local commissions\". The United States, with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, suggested United Nations supervision. This plan was rejected by Soviet representative Vyacheslav Molotov, who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and non-communist members, which could determine \"important\" issues only by unanimous agreement. The negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification. North Vietnam argued that the elections should be held within six months of the ceasefire while the Western allies sought to have no deadline. Molotov proposed June 1955, then later softened this to any time in 1955 and finally July 1956. The Diem government supported reunification elections, but only with effective international supervision, arguing that genuinely free elections were otherwise impossible in the totalitarian North. By the afternoon of 20 July, the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and the elections for a reunified government should be held in July 1956, two years after the ceasefire. The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam was only signed by the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military commands, with no participation or consultation of the State of Vietnam. Based on a proposal by Chinese delegation head Zhou Enlai, an International Control Commission (ICC) chaired by India, with Canada and Poland as members, was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire. Because issues were to be decided unanimously, Poland's presence in the ICC provided the Communists with effective veto power over supervision of the treaty. The unsigned Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference called for reunification elections, which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections, insisting that the ICC's \"competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties\". Of the nine nations represented, only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration. Undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith delivered a \"unilateral declaration\" of the United States position, reiterating: \"We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to ensure that they are conducted fairly\".\n\nBetween 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which were accompanied by significant political repression. During the land reform, testimonies by North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which if extrapolated would indicate a nationwide total of nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was mainly concentrated in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions was widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although it was likely greater than 13,500.\n\n\n== The Vietnam War ==\nAs early as June 1956 the idea of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government was presented at a politburo meeting. In 1959, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh began urging the Politburo to send aid to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng in South Vietnam and a \"people's war\" on the South was approved at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. North Vietnam invaded Laos in July 1959 aided by the Pathet Lao and used 30,000 men to build a network of supply and reinforcement routes running through Laos and Cambodia that became known as the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail. It allowed the North to send manpower and material to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng with much less exposure to South Vietnamese forces, achieving a considerable advantage. To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng was stressed in Communist propaganda. North Vietnam created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 as a \"united front\", or political branch of the Viet Cong intended to encourage the participation of non-Communists.At the end of 1959, conscious that the national election would never be held and that Diem intended to purge opposing forces (mostly ex Vi\u1ec7t Minh) from the South Vietnamese society, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh informally chose L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n to become the next party leader. This was interpreted by Western analysts as a loss of influence for H\u1ed3, who was said to actually have preferred the more moderate V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p for the position. From 1959 onward, the elderly Ho became increasingly worried about the prospect of his death, and that year he wrote down his will. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was officially named party leader in 1960, leaving H\u1ed3 to function in a secondary role as head of state and member of the Politburo. He nevertheless maintained considerable influence in the government. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, T\u1ed1 H\u1eefu, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng often shared dinner with H\u1ed3, and all of them remained key figures throughout and after the war. In the early 1960s, the North Vietnamese Politburo was divided the \"North first\" faction who favored focusing on the economic development of North Vietnam, and the \"South first\" faction, who favored a guerrilla war in South Vietnam to reunite Vietnam in the near future.Between 1961 and 1963, 40,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated into South Vietnam from the North. In 1963, H\u1ed3 purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Diem in hopes of achieving a negotiated peace. During the so-called \"Maneli Affair\" of 1963, a French diplomatic initiative was launched with the aim of achieving a federation of the two Vietnams, which would be neutral in the Cold War. The four principle diplomats involved in the \"Maneli affair\" were Ramchundur Goburdhun, the Indian Chief Commissioner of the ICC; Mieczys\u0142aw Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC; Roger Lalouette, the French ambassador to South Vietnam; and Giovanni d'Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam. Maneli reported that Ho was very interested in the signs of a split between President Diem and President Kennedy and that his attitude was: \"Our real enemies are the Americans. Get rid them, and we can cope with Diem and Nhu afterward\".At a meeting in Hanoi held in French, Ho told Goburdhun that Diem was \"in his own way a patriot\", noting that Diem had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time Goburdhun met Diem \"shake hands with him for me\". The North Vietnamese Premier Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, speaking on behalf of Ho, told Maneli he was interested in the peace plan, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam \"we can come to an agreement with any Vietnamese\". On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man to Diem to discuss the French peace plan. It remains unclear if the Ngo brothers were serious about the French peace plan or were merely using the possibility of accepting it to blackmail the United States into supporting them at a time when the Buddhist crisis had seriously strained relations between Saigon and Washington. Supporting the latter theory is the fact that Nhu promptly leaked his meeting with Maneli to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who publicized it in a column entitled \"Very Ugly Stuff\". The mere possibility that the Ngo brothers might accept the peace plan helped persuade the Kennedy administration to support the coup against them. On 1 November 1963, a coup overthrow Diem, who was killed the next day together with his brother.\nDiem had followed a policy of \"deconstructing the state\" by creating a number of overlapping agencies and departments who were encouraged to feud with one another in order to disorganize the South Vietnamese state to such an extent that he hoped that it would make a coup against him impossible. When Diem was overthrown and killed, without any kind of arbiter between the rival arms of the South Vietnamese state, South Vietnam promptly disintegrated. The American Defense Secretary Robert McNamara reported after visiting South Vietnam in December 1963 that \"there is no organized government worthy of the name\" in Saigon. At a meeting of the plenum of the Politburo in December 1963, L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n's \"South first\" faction triumphed with the Politburo passing a resolution calling for North Vietnam to complete the overthrow of the regime in Saigon as soon as possible while the members of the \"North first\" faction were dismissed. As South Vietnam descended into chaos, whatever interest Ho might had in the French peace plan ended as it become clear it was possible for the Viet Cong to overthrow the government in Saigon. A CIA report from 1964 stated the factionalism in South Vietnam had reached \"almost the point of anarchy\" as various South Vietnamese leaders fought one another, making any sort of effort against the Viet Cong impossible, which was rapidly taking over much of the South Vietnamese countryside.As South Vietnam collapsed into factionalism and in-fighting while the Viet Cong continued to win the war, it became increasingly apparent to President Lyndon Johnson that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam. Though Johnson did not wish to commit American forces until he had won the 1964 election, he decided to make his intentions clear to Hanoi. In June 1964, the \"Seaborn Mission\" began as J. Blair Seaborn, the Canadian commissioner to the ICC, arrived in Hanoi with a message from Johnson offering billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition in exchange for which North Vietnam would cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn also warned that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing, saying that Johnson was seriously considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Little came of the back channel of the \"Seaborn Mission\" as the North Vietnamese distrusted Seaborn, who pointedly was never allowed to meet Ho.In late 1964, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) combat troops were sent southwest into officially neutral Laos and Cambodia. By March 1965, American combat troops began arriving in South Vietnam, first to protect the airbases around Chu Lai and Da Nang, later to take on most of the fight as \"[m]ore and more American troops were put in to replace Saigon troops who could not, or would not, get involved in the fighting\". As fighting escalated, widespread aerial and artillery bombardment all over North Vietnam by the United States Air Force and Navy began with Operation Rolling Thunder. On 8-9 April 1965, Ho made a secret visit to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. It was agreed that no Chinese combat troops would enter North Vietnam unless the United States invaded North Vietnam, but that China would send support troops to North Vietnam to help maintain the infrastructure damaged by American bombing. There was a deep distrust and fear of China within the North Vietnamese Politburo, and the suggestion that Chinese troops, even support troops, be allowed into North Vietnam, caused outrage in the Politburo. Ho had to use all his moral authority to obtain the Politburo's approval.According to Chen Jian, during the mid-to-late 1960s, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n permitted 320,000 Chinese volunteers into North Vietnam to help build infrastructure for the country, thereby freeing a similar number of PAVN personnel to go south. There are no sources from Vietnam, the United States, or the Soviet Union that confirm the number of Chinese troops stationed in North Vietnam. However, the Chinese government later admitted to sending 320,000 Chinese soldiers to Vietnam during the 1960s and spent over $20 billion to support Hanoi's regular North Vietnamese Army and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng guerrilla units.To counter the American bombing, the entire population of North Vietnam was mobilized for the war effort with vast teams of women being used to repair the damage done by the bombers, often at a speed that astonished the Americans. The bombing of North Vietnam proved to be the principle obstacle to opening peace talks as Ho repeatedly stated that no peace talks would be possible unless the United States unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam. Like many of the other leaders of the newly independent states of Asia and Africa, Ho was extremely sensitive about threats, whatever perceived or real, to his nation's independence and sovereignty. Ho regarded the American bombing as a violation of North Vietnam's sovereignty, and he felt that to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to bomb North Vietnam should he not behave as they wanted him to do, would diminish North Vietnam's independence.In March 1966, a Canadian diplomat, Chester Ronning, arrived in Hanoi with an offer to use his \"good offices\" to begin peace talks. However, the Ronning mission foundered upon the bombing issue, as the North Vietnamese demanded an unconditional halt to the bombing, an undertaking that Johnson refused to give. In June 1966, Janusz Lewandowski, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC, was able via d'Orlandi to see Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the American ambassador to South Vietnam, with an offer from Ho. Ho's offer for a \"political compromise\" as transmitted by Lewandowski included allowing South Vietnam to maintain its alliance with the U.S, instead of becoming neutral; having the Viet Cong \"take part\" in negotiations for a coalition government, instead being allowed to automatically enter a coalition government; and allowing a \"reasonable calendar\" for the withdrawal of American troops instead of an immediate withdrawal. Operation Marigold as the Lewandowski channel came to be code-named almost led to American-North Vietnamese talks in Warsaw in December 1966, but collapsed over the bombing issue.In January 1967, General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh, the commander of the forces in South Vietnam, returned to Hanoi, to present a plan that became the genesis of the Tet Offensive a year later. Thanh expressed much concern about the Americans invading Laos to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to preempt this possibility, urged an all-out offensive to win the war with a sudden blow. L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n supported Thanh's plans, which were stoutly opposed by the Defense Minister, General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, who preferred to continue with a guerrilla war, arguing that the superior American firepower would ensure the failure of Thanh's proposed offensive. With the Politburo divided, it was agreed to study and debate the issue more.In July 1967, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and most of the Politburo of the Communist Party met in a high-profile conference where they concluded the war had fallen into a stalemate. The American military presence forced the PAVN to expend the majority of their resources on maintaining the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail rather than reinforcing their comrade's ranks in the South. Ho seems to have agreed to Thanh's offensive because he wanted to see Vietnam reunified within his lifetime, and the increasingly ailing Ho was painfully aware that he did not have much time left. With Ho's permission, the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng planned a massive Tet Offensive that would commence on 31 January 1968, with the aim of taking much of the South by force and dealing a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of North Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\nIn early 1969, Ho suffered a heart attack and was in increasingly bad health for the rest of the year. In July 1969, Jean Sainteny, a former French official in Vietnam who knew Ho secretly transmitted a letter to him from President Richard Nixon. Nixon's letter proposed working together to end this \"tragic war\", but also warned that if North Vietnam made no concessions at the peace talks in Paris by 1 November, Nixon would resort to \"measures of great consequence and force\". Ho's reply, which Nixon received on 30 August 1969 made no concessions, as Nixon's threats apparently made no impression on him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot. His father was a scholar and teacher who received a high degree in the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty Imperial examination. H\u1ed3 was taught to master Classical Chinese at a young age. Before the August Revolution, he often wrote poetry in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n (the Vietnamese name for the Chinese writing system). One of those is Poems from the Prison Diary, written when he was imprisoned by the police of the Republic of China. This poetry chronicle is Vietnam National Treasure No. 10 and was translated into many languages. It is used in Vietnamese high schools. After Vietnam gained independence from France, the new government exclusively promoted Ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef (Vietnamese writing system in Latin characters) to eliminate illiteracy. H\u1ed3 started to create more poems in the modern Vietnamese language for dissemination to a wider range of readers. From when he became president until the appearance of serious health problems, a short poem of his was regularly published in the newspaper Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n T\u1ebft (Lunar new year) edition to encourage his people in working, studying or fighting Americans in the new year.\n\nBecause he was in exile for nearly 30 years, H\u1ed3 could speak fluently as well as read and write professionally in French, English, Russian, Cantonese and Mandarin as well as his mother tongue Vietnamese. In addition, he was reported to speak conversational Esperanto. In the 1920s, he was bureau chief/editor of many newspapers which he established to criticize French Colonial Government of Indochina and serving communism propaganda purposes. Examples are Le Paria (The Pariah) first published in Paris 1922 or Thanh Nien (Youth) first published on 21 June 1925 (21 June was named by The Socialist Republic of Vietnam Government as Vietnam Revolutionary Journalism Day). In many state official visits to Soviet Union and China, he often talked directly to their communist leaders without interpreters especially about top secret information. While being interviewed by Western journalists, he used French. His Vietnamese had a strong accent from his birthplace in the central province of Ngh\u1ec7 An, but could be widely understood throughout the country.As President, he held formal receptions for foreign heads of state and ambassadors at the Presidential Palace, but he personally did not live there. He ordered the building of a stilt house at the back of the palace, which is today known as the Presidential Palace Historical Site. His hobbies (according to his secretary V\u0169 K\u1ef3) included reading, gardening, feeding fish (many of which are still living) and visiting schools and children's homes.He is believed by some to have married Zeng Xueming, although only being able to live with her for less than a year.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh remained in Hanoi during his final years, demanding the unconditional withdrawal of all non-Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam. By 1969, with negotiations still dragging on, his health began to deteriorate from multiple health problems, including diabetes which prevented him from participating in further active politics. However, he insisted that his forces in the South continue fighting until all of Vietnam was reunited regardless of the length of time that it might take, believing that time was on his side.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nWith the outcome of the Vietnam War still in question, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh died of heart failure at his home in Hanoi at 9:47 on the morning of 2 September 1969; he was 79 years old. His embalmed body is currently on display in a mausoleum in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square in Hanoi despite his will which stated that he wanted to be cremated.The North Vietnamese government originally announced Ho's death as 3 September. A week of mourning for his death was decreed nationwide in North Vietnam from 4 to 11 September 1969. His funeral was attended by about 250,000 people and 5,000 official guests, which included many international mourners.\nAmong the dignitaries to attend were :\n\n Leader L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam\n President Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Th\u1ecd of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\n Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia\n Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma of Laos\n Premier Alexei Kosygin of the Soviet Union\n President Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia\n Deputy Premier Ignacy Loga-Sowi\u0144ski of Poland\n Politician Erich M\u00fcckenberger of East Germany\n Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer of Romania\n Vice President Li Xiannian of China\n General Secretary of the Communist Party Kenji Miyamoto of JapanRepresentatives from 40 countries and regions were also presented. During the mourning period, North Vietnam received more than 22,000 condolences letters from 20 organizations and 110 countries across the world, such as France, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Zambia, and many others, mostly Socialist countries.\nIt was said that Ho's body was hid, and carried a long way among forests and rivers in a special-designed coffin until Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum was built.\nHe was not initially replaced as president; instead a \"collective leadership\" composed of several ministers and military leaders took over, known as the Politburo. During North Vietnam's final campaign, a famous song written by composer Huy Thuc was often sung by PAVN soldiers: \"B\u00e1c v\u1eabn c\u00f9ng ch\u00fang ch\u00e1u h\u00e0nh qu\u00e2n\" (\"You are still marching with us, Uncle Ho\").During the Fall of Saigon in April 1975, several PAVN tanks displayed a poster with those same words on it. The day after the battle ended, on 1 May, veteran Australian journalist Denis Warner reported that \"When the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon yesterday, they were led by a man who wasn't there\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nHo Chi Minh remains one of the most divisive figures in modern contemporary history.\nThe Vietnamese Socialist Republic has sustained the personality cult of Uncle Ho (B\u00e1c H\u1ed3), the Bringer of Light (Ch\u00ed Minh). It is comparable in many ways to that of Mao Zedong in China and of Kim il-sung and Kim Jong-il in North Korea. There is the embalmed body on view in a massive mausoleum, the ubiquity of his image featured in every public building and schoolroom, and other displays of reverence, some unofficial, that verge on \"worship\". (Ho Chi Minh's image appears on some family altars, and there is at least one temple dedicated to him, built in then-Vi\u1ec7t-C\u1ed9ng-controlled V\u0129nh Long shortly after his death in 1970).\n\nIn The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam (1982) Duiker suggests that the cult of Ho Chi Minh is indicative of a larger legacy, one that drew on \"elements traditional to the exercise of control and authority in Vietnamese society.\" Duiker is drawn to an \"irresistible and persuasive\" comparison with China. As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Ho Chi Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule Cochinchina) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".\n\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of Confucianism, condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (gia truong). The socialist conception of social equality destroyed the Confucian views of class.\n\nYet Duiker argues many were to find the new ideology \"congenial\" precisely because of its similarities with the teachings of the old Master: \"the belief in one truth, embodied in quasi-sacred texts\"; in \"an anointed elite, trained in an all-embracing doctrine and responsible for leading the broad masses and indoctrinating them in proper thought and behavior\"; in \"the subordination of the individual to the community\"; and in the perfectibility, through corrective action, of human nature. All of this, Duiker suggests, was in some manner present in the aura of the new Master, Chi Minh, \"the bringer of light,\" \"Uncle Ho\" to whom \"all the desirable qualities of Confucian ethics\" are ascribed. Under Ho Chi Minh, Vietnamese Marxism developed, in effect, as a kind of \"reformed Confucianism\" revised to meet \"the challenges of the modern era\" and, not least among these, of \"total mobilisation in the struggle for national independence and state power.\"This \"congeniality\" with Confucian tradition was remarked on by Nguyen Khac Vien, a leading Hanoi intellectual of the 1960 and 70s. In Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam Nguyen Khac Vien, saw definite parallels between Confucian and party discipline, between the traditional scholar gentry and Ho Chi Minh's party cadres.A completely different form of the cult of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (and one tolerated by the government with some uneasiness) is his identification in Vietnamese folk religion with the Jade Emperor, who supposedly incarnated again on earth as H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. Today H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums. The first such medium was one Madam Lang in the 1990s, but the cult acquired a significant number of followers through another medium, Madam Xoan. She established on 1 January 2001 \u0110\u1ea1o Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u1eadt H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (the Way of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Buddha) also known as \u0110\u1ea1o B\u00e1c H\u1ed3 (the Way of Uncle H\u1ed3) at \u0111\u1ec1n H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (the Peace Temple) in Ch\u00ed Linh-Sao \u0110\u1ecf district of H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng province. She then founded the Peace Society of Heavenly Mediums (\u0110o\u00e0n \u0111\u1ed3ng thi\u00ean H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh). Reportedly, by 2014 the movement had around 24,000 followers.Yet even when the Vietnamese government's attempt to immortalize Ho Chi Minh was also met with significant controversies and opposition. The regime is sensitive to anything that might question the official hagiography. This includes references to Ho Chi Minh's personal life that might detract from the image of the dedicated \"the father of the revolution\", the \"celibate married only to the cause of revolution\". William Duiker's Ho Chi Minh: A Life (2000) was candid on the matter of Ho Chi Minh's liaisons. The government sought cuts in a Vietnamese translation and banned distribution of an issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review which carried a small item about the controversy.There has been a number of criticisms against him, where his role on the land reforms had led to the death of more than 172,000 people. A large number of Vietnamese, mostly from diaspora communities and those who still live in modern Southern Vietnam, which have strongly opposed the communist government, considered Ho Chi Minh as a leader who led Vietnam to suffer total destruction and a brutal campaign in terrors accordance to communist terrorism, including the instigation of Vietnam War that led to the complete destruction of Vietnamese nation. These claims have received enormous support from the anti-communist and anti-totalitarian groups across the world, which saw Ho Chi Minh, using the mask of \"liberation\", initiated a complete cultural and human genocide inside the country. These claims have been denied by the communist government.\nHo Chi Minh was listed as one of the war criminals in The Black Book of Communism, where he was accused of killing one million Vietnamese.\n\n\n== International influence ==\n\n \nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh is considered one of the most influential leaders in the world. Time magazine listed him in the list of 100 Most Important People of the Twentieth Century (Time 100) in 1998. His thought and revolution inspired many leaders and people on a global scale in Asia, Africa and Latin America during the decolonization movement which occurred after World War II. As a communist, he was one of the international figures who were highly praised in the Communist world.Various places, boulevards and squares are named after him around the world, especially in Socialist states and former Communist states. In Russia, there is a H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square and monument in Moscow, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh boulevard in Saint Petersburg and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square in Ulyanovsk (the birthplace of Vladimir Lenin, a sister city of Vinh, the birthplace of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh). During the Vietnam War the then West Bengal government, in the hands of CPI(M), renamed Harrington Street to Ho Chi Minh Sarani, which is also the location of the Consulate General of the United States of America in Kolkata. According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as many as 20 countries across Asia, Europe, America and Africa have erected statues in remembrance of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh.Busts, statues and memorial plaques and exhibitions are displayed in destinations on his extensive world journey in exile from 1911 to 1941 including France, Great Britain, Russia, China and Thailand.Many activists and musicians wrote songs about H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his revolution in different languages during the Vietnam War to demonstrate against the United States. Spanish songs were composed by F\u00e9lix Pita Rodr\u00edguez, Carlos Puebla and Al\u00ed Primera. In addition, the Chilean folk singer V\u00edctor Jara referenced H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh in his anti-war song \"El derecho de vivir en paz\" (\"The Right to Live in Peace\"). In English, Ewan MacColl wrote \"The Ballad of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh\" and Pete Seeger wrote \"Teacher Uncle Ho\". Russian songs about him were written by Vladimir Fere and German songs about him were written by Kurt Demmler.\nIn 1987, UNESCO officially recommended that its member states \"join in the commemoration of the centenary of the birth of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh by organizing various events as a tribute to his memory\", considering \"the important and many-sided contributions of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to the fields of culture, education and the arts\" who \"devoted his whole life to the national liberation of the Vietnamese people, contributing to the common struggle of peoples for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Essays ===\nBernard B.

        "wiki": "The tunnels of C\u1ee7 Chi are an immense network of connecting tunnels located in the C\u1ee7 Chi District of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam, and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the Vietnam War, and were the Viet Cong's base of operations for the T\u1ebft Offensive in 1968.\nThe tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as hiding spots during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces, and helped to counter the growing American military effort.\n\n\n== Life in tunnels ==\nAmerican soldiers used the term \"Black Echo\" to describe the conditions within the tunnels. For the Viet Cong, life in the tunnels was difficult. Air, food and water were scarce, and the tunnels were infested with ants, venomous centipedes, snakes, scorpions, spiders, and rodents. Most of the time, soldiers would spend the day in the tunnels working or resting and come out only at night to scavenge for supplies, tend their crops, or engage the enemy in battle. Sometimes, during periods of heavy bombing or American troop movement, they would be forced to remain underground for many days at a time. Sickness was rampant among the people living in the tunnels, especially malaria, which was the second largest cause of death next to battle wounds. A captured Viet Cong report suggests that at any given time, half of a unit of the People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) unit had malaria and that \"one-hundred percent had intestinal parasites of significance.\"\n\n\n== U.S. campaigns against tunnels ==\n\nThe tunnels of C\u1ee7 Chi were noticed by U.S. officials, who recognized the advantages that the Viet Cong held with the tunnels and so launched several major campaigns to search out and destroy the tunnel system. Among the most important were Operation Crimp and Operation Cedar Falls.\nOperation Crimp began on January 7, 1966, with B-52 bombers dropping 30-ton loads of high explosive onto the region of C\u1ee7 Chi, effectively turning the once lush jungle into a pockmarked moonscape. Eight thousand troops from the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment combed the region looking for any clues of PLAF activity.\n\nThe operation did not bring about the desired success. For instance, when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. No one was usually sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two most common responses in dealing with a tunnel opening would be to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open or to toss a few grenades down the hole and \"crimp\" off the opening. Those approaches proved ineffective because of the design of the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.\nHowever, an Australian specialist engineering troop, 3 Field Troop, under the command of Captain Alexander \"Sandy\" MacGregor ventured into the tunnels, which they searched exhaustively for four days, l and found ammunition, radio equipment, medical supplies, food, and signs of considerable Viet Cong presence. One of their number, Corporal Robert \"Bob\" Bowtell, died when he became trapped in a tunnel that turned out to  be a dead end. However the Australians pressed on and revealed for the first time the immense military significance of the tunnels.  At an international press conference in Saigon shortly after Operation Crimp, MacGregor referred to his men as \"tunnel ferrets. \" An American journalist who had never heard of ferrets, used the term \"tunnel rat,\" and it stuck. After his troop's discoveries in C\u1ee7 Chi, MacGregor was awarded a Military Cross.From its mistakes and the Australians' discoveries, U.S. command realized that it needed a new way to approach the dilemma of the tunnels. A general order was issued by General Williamson, the Allied Forces Commander in South Vietnam, to all Allied forces that tunnels had to be properly searched whenever they were discovered. It began training an elite group of volunteers in the art of tunnel warfare, armed only with a handgun, a knife, a flashlight, and a piece of string. The specialists, commonly known as \"tunnel rats\", would enter a tunnel by themselves and travel inch-by-inch cautiously looking ahead for booby traps or cornered PLAF. There was no real doctrine for the approach, and despite some very hard work in some sectors of the Army and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, to provide some sort of training and resources, it was primarily a new approach that the units trained, equipped, and planned for themselves.\nDespite the revamped effort at fighting the enemy on their own terms, U.S. operations remained insufficient at eliminating the tunnels completely. In 1967, General William Westmoreland tried to launch a larger assault on C\u1ee7 Chi and the Iron Triangle. Called Operation Cedar Falls, it was similar to the previous Operation Crimp but was on a larger scale with 30,000 troops, instead of 8,000. On January 18, tunnel rats from the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division uncovered the Viet Cong district headquarters of C\u1ee7 Chi, containing half a million documents concerning all types of military strategy. Among the documents were maps of U.S. bases, detailed accounts of PLAF movement from Cambodia into Vietnam, lists of political sympathizers, and even plans for a failed assassination attempt on Robert McNamara.\nBy 1969, B-52s were freed from bombing North Vietnam and started \"carpet bombing\" C\u1ee7 Chi and the rest of the Iron Triangle. Towards the end of the war, the tunnels were so heavily bombed that some portions actually caved in, and other sections were exposed. But by then, they had succeeded in protecting the local North Vietnamese units and letting them \"survive to fight another day.\"\nThroughout the war, the tunnels in and around C\u1ee7 Chi proved to be a source of frustration for the U.S. military in Saigon. The Viet Cong had been so well entrenched in the area by 1965 that it was in the unique position of being able to control where and when battles would take place. By helping to covertly move supplies and house troops, the tunnels of C\u1ee7 Chi allowed North Vietnamese fighters in their area of South Vietnam to survive, help prolong the war and increase U.S. costs and casualties until the eventual withdrawal in 1972, and the final defeat of South Vietnam in 1975.\n\n\n== Tourist destinations ==\n\nThe 75-mile (121 km)-long complex of tunnels at C\u1ee7 Chi has been preserved by the government of Vietnam, and turned into a war memorial park with two different tunnel display sites, Ben Dinh and Ben Duoc. The tunnels are a popular tourist attraction in Vietnam, and visitors are invited to crawl around in the safer parts of the tunnel system. The Ben Duoc site contains part of the original tunnel system, and the Ben Dinh site, closer to Saigon, has tunnel reconstructions and some tunnels have been made larger to accommodate tourists. In both sites, low-power lights have been installed in the tunnels to make traveling through them easier, and both sites have displays of the different types of booby traps that were used. Underground conference rooms in which campaigns such as the T\u1ebft Offensive were planned in 1968 have been restored, and visitors may enjoy a simple meal of food that Viet Cong fighters would have eaten.Above-ground attractions include caged monkeys, vendors selling souvenirs, and a shooting range, where visitors can fire a number of assault rifles, such as the M16 rifle or AK-47, or a general-purpose machine guns, such as the M60.\n\n\n== See also ==\nV\u1ecbnh M\u1ed1c tunnels\nC\u1ee7 Chi Base Camp\nC\u1ee7 Chi Tunnels Website\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Tunnels of Cu Chi, Tom Mangold & John Penycate, Berkley Books, New York, 1986, ISBN 0-425-08951-7\nTunnel Rats by Jimmy Thomson with Sandy MacGregor (Allen & Unwin, Australia, 2011)(Website)\nA Sappers War by Jimmy Thomson with Sandy MacGregor (Allen & Unwin, Australia, 2012)\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotos of Cu Chi and Vietnamese Tunnels from mondesouterrain.fr\nCu Chi Tunnels Travel Guide",

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants.

To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels.

The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments.

The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants).

As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants).

As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020.

Other ethnic minorities include Khmer with 0.34%, and Cham with 0.1%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe three most prevalent religions in Ho Chi Minh City are Mahayana Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism (via ancestor worship), which are often celebrated together in the same temple. Most Vietnamese and Han Chinese are strongly influenced by these traditional religious practices. There is a sizeable community of Roman Catholics, representing about 10% of the city's population. Other minority groups include H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, Protestants, Muslims, Hindus, and members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHo Chi Minh City is the economic center of Vietnam and accounts for a large proportion of the economy of Vietnam.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99.

Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

The largest stadium in the city is the 25,000-seat Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Stadium, located on \u0110\u00e0o Duy T\u1eeb Street, in Ward 6 of District 10. The next largest is Army Stadium, located near Tan Son Nhat Airport in T\u00e2n B\u00ecnh district. Army Stadium was of the venues for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup finals. As well as being a sporting venue, it is also the site of a music school. Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd Racecourse, another notable sporting venue established during colonial times, is the only racetrack in Vietnam. The city's Department of Physical Education and Sports also manages a number of clubs, including Phan Dinh Phung, Thanh Da, and Yet Kieu.\nHo Chi Minh City is home to a number of association football clubs. One of the city's largest clubs, Ho Chi Minh City F.C., is based at Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Stadium.

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city.

Together with the Hi-Tech Park in District 9, and the 32 ha. software park inside Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone in District 7 of the city, Ho Chi Minh City aims to become an important hi-tech city in the country and the South-East Asia region.\nThis park helps the city in particular and Vietnam in general to become an outsourcing location for other enterprises in developed countries, as India has done. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, and also in construction, building materials and agricultural products. Additionally, crude oil is a popular economic base in the city. Investors are still pouring money into the city.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh City's ports reached 50.5 million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\n\n=== New urban areas ===\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels. The C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels are north-west of the city in C\u1ee7 Chi District. The Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, in District 1, dates from 1865. The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

        "wiki": "Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c (Vietnamese: [t\u02b0\u01d0k\u031f k\u02b7\u00e2\u02d0\u014b \u0257\u0268\u030ck] (listen); 1897 \u2013 11 June 1963; born L\u00e2m V\u0103n T\u00fac) was a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who burned himself to death at a busy Saigon road intersection on 11 June 1963. Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese Roman Catholic Christian government led by Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m. Photographs of his self-immolation were circulated widely around the world and brought attention to the policies of the Di\u1ec7m government. John F. Kennedy said in reference to a photograph of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c on fire, \"No news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one.\" Malcolm Browne won a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph of the monk's death.Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's act increased international pressure on Di\u1ec7m and led him to announce reforms with the intention of mollifying the Buddhists. However, the promised reforms were not implemented, leading to a deterioration in the dispute. As protests continued, the ARVN Special Forces loyal to Di\u1ec7m's brother, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, launched nationwide raids on Buddhist pagodas, seizing Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's heart and causing deaths and widespread damage. Several Buddhist monks followed Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's example, also immolating themselves. Eventually, a U.S.-backed Army coup toppled Di\u1ec7m, who was assassinated on 2 November 1963.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAccounts of the life of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c are derived from information disseminated by Buddhist organizations. He was born in the village of H\u1ed9i Kh\u00e1nh, in V\u1ea1n Ninh District of Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province in central Vietnam as L\u00e2m V\u0103n T\u00fac, one of seven children of L\u00e2m H\u1eefu \u1ee8ng and his wife, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb N\u01b0\u01a1ng. At the age of seven, he left to study Buddhism under H\u00f2a th\u01b0\u1ee3ng  Th\u00edch Ho\u1eb1ng Th\u00e2m, who was his maternal uncle and spiritual master. Th\u00edch Ho\u1eb1ng Th\u00e2m raised him as a son and L\u00e2m V\u0103n T\u00fac changed his name to Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Khi\u1ebft. At age 15, he took the samanera (novice) vows and was ordained as a monk at age 20 under the dharma name Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c. The Vietnamese name Th\u00edch (\u91cb) is from \"Th\u00edch Ca\" or \"Th\u00edch Gi\u00e0\" (\u91cb\u8fe6), means \"of the Shakya clan.\" After ordination, he traveled to a mountain near Ninh H\u00f2a, vowing to live the life of a solitary Buddhism-practicing hermit for three years. He returned in later life to open the Thien Loc pagoda at his mountain retreat.After his self-imposed isolation ended, he began to travel around central Vietnam expounding the dharma. After two years, he went into retreat at the Sac Tu Thien An pagoda near Nha Trang. In 1932, he was appointed an inspector for the Buddhist Association in Ninh H\u00f2a before becoming the inspector of monks in his home province of Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a. During this period in central Vietnam, he was responsible for the construction of 14 temples. In 1934, he moved to southern Vietnam and traveled throughout the provinces spreading Buddhist teachings. During his time in southern Vietnam, he also spent two years in Cambodia studying the Theravada Buddhist tradition.\nUpon his return from Cambodia, he oversaw the construction of a further 17 new temples during his time in the south. The last of the 31 new temples that he was responsible for constructing was the Quan The Am pagoda in the Ph\u00fa Nhu\u1eadn District of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Province on the outskirts of Saigon. The street on which the temple stands was later renamed Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c Street in 1975. After the temple-building phase, Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c was appointed to serve as the Chairman of the Panel on Ceremonial Rites of the Congregation of Vietnamese Monks, and as abbot of the Phuoc Hoa pagoda, which was the initial location of the Association for Buddhist Studies of Vietnam (ABSV). When the office of the ABSV was relocated to the X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda, the main pagoda of Saigon, Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c resigned.\n\n\n== Self-immolation ==\n\n\n=== Religious background ===\n\nIn a country where surveys of the religious composition at the time estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, President Di\u1ec7m was a member of the Catholic minority, and pursued discriminatory policies favoring Catholics for public service and military promotions, as well as in the allocation of land, business arrangements and tax concessions. Di\u1ec7m once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting that the officer was from a Buddhist family, \"Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted.\" Many officers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) converted to Roman Catholicism as their military prospects depended on it. Additionally, the distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias saw weapons given only to Roman Catholics, with some Buddhists in the army being denied promotion if they refused to convert to Roman Catholicism.Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies, and there were forced conversions and looting, shelling, and demolition of pagodas in some areas, to which the government turned a blind eye. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Di\u1ec7m's regime. The \"private\" status that was imposed on Buddhism by the French, which required official permission to be obtained by those wishing to conduct public Buddhist activities, was not repealed by Di\u1ec7m. Catholics were also de facto exempt from corv\u00e9e labor, which the government obliged all citizens to perform, and United States aid was distributed disproportionately to Catholic majority villages by Di\u1ec7m's regime.The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country and enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and land owned by the Catholic Church was exempt from land reform. The white and gold Vatican flag was regularly flown at all major public events in South Vietnam, and Di\u1ec7m dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary in 1959.Buddhist discontent erupted following a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Hu\u1ebf on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c of Hu\u1ebf, Di\u1ec7m's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Di\u1ec7m's refusal to take responsibility\u2014he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths\u2014led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.\n\n\n=== Day of the act ===\n\nOn 10 June 1963, U.S. correspondents were informed that \"something important\" would happen the following morning on the road outside the Cambodian embassy in Saigon. Most of the reporters disregarded the message, since the Buddhist crisis had at that point been going on for more than a month, and the next day only a few journalists turned up, including David Halberstam of The New York Times and Malcolm Browne, the Saigon bureau chief for the Associated Press (AP). Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c arrived as part of a procession that had begun at a nearby pagoda. Around 350 monks and nuns marched in two phalanxes, preceded by an Austin Westminster sedan, carrying banners printed in both English and Vietnamese. They denounced the Di\u1ec7m government and its policy towards Buddhists, demanding that it fulfill its promises of religious equality. Another monk offered himself, but Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's seniority prevailed.The act occurred at the intersection of Phan \u0110\u00ecnh Ph\u00f9ng Boulevard (now Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u Street) and L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t Street (now C\u00e1ch M\u1ea1ng Th\u00e1ng T\u00e1m Street) (10.7750\u00b0N 106.6868\u00b0E\ufeff / 10.7750; 106.6868\ufeff (Self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc 1963)), a few blocks southwest of the Presidential Palace (now the Reunification Palace). Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c emerged from the car along with two other monks. One placed a cushion on the road while the second opened the trunk and took out a five-gallon petrol can. As the marchers formed a circle around him, Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c calmly sat down in the traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's head. Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words Nam m\u00f4 A Di \u0110\u00e0 Ph\u1eadt (\"Homage to Amit\u0101bha Buddha\") before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.\nQu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's last words before his self-immolation were documented in a letter he had left: \"Before closing my eyes and moving towards the vision of the Buddha, I respectfully plead to President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m to take a mind of compassion towards the people of the nation and implement religious equality to maintain the strength of the homeland eternally. I call the venerables, reverends, members of the sangha and the lay Buddhists to organize in solidarity to make sacrifices to protect Buddhism.\"\nDavid Halberstam wrote: \"I was to see that sight again, but once was enough. Flames were coming from a human being; his body was slowly withering and shriveling up, his head blackening and charring. In the air was the smell of burning human flesh; human beings burn surprisingly quickly. Behind me I could hear the sobbing of the Vietnamese who were now gathering. I was too shocked to cry, too confused to take notes or ask questions, too bewildered to even think ... As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him.\"\nThe spectators were mostly stunned into silence, but some wailed and several began praying. Many of the monks and nuns, as well as some shocked passersby, prostrated themselves before the burning monk. Even some of the policemen, who had orders to control the gathered crowd, prostrated before him.In English and Vietnamese, a monk repeated into a microphone: \"A Buddhist priest burns himself to death. A Buddhist priest becomes a martyr.\" After approximately 10 minutes, Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's body was fully immolated and it eventually toppled backwards onto its back. Once the fire subsided, a group of monks covered the smoking corpse with yellow robes, picked it up and tried to fit it into a coffin, but the limbs could not be straightened and one of the arms protruded from the wooden box as he was carried to the nearby X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda in central Saigon. Outside the pagoda, students unfurled bilingual banners which read: \"A Buddhist priest burns himself for our five requests.\"By 1:30 pm (13:30), around 1,000 monks had congregated inside to hold a meeting, while outside a large crowd of pro-Buddhist students had formed a human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but 100 monks slowly left the compound. Nearly 1,000 monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm (18:00), thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.\n\n\n=== Funeral and aftermath ===\nAfter the self-immolation, the U.S. put more pressure on Di\u1ec7m to re-open negotiations on the faltering agreement. Di\u1ec7m had scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:30 on 11 June to discuss the Buddhist crisis which he believed to be winding down. Following Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's death, Di\u1ec7m canceled the meeting and met individually with his ministers. Acting U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam William Trueheart warned Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn, Di\u1ec7m's Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was \"dangerously near breaking point\" and expected Di\u1ec7m would meet the Buddhists' five-point manifesto. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned the Saigon embassy that the White House would publicly announce that it would no longer \"associate itself\" with the regime if this did not occur. The Joint Communiqu\u00e9 and concessions to the Buddhists were signed on 16 June.15 June was set as the date for the funeral, and on that day 4,000 people gathered outside the X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i pagoda, only for the ceremony to be postponed. On 19 June, his remains were carried out of X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i to a cemetery 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) south of the city for a re-cremation and funeral ceremony. Following the signing of the Joint Communiqu\u00e9, attendance was limited by agreement between Buddhist leaders and police to approximately 500 monks.\n\n\n=== Intact heart and symbolism ===\n\nThe body was re-cremated during the funeral, but Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's heart remained intact and did not burn. It was considered to be holy and placed in a glass chalice at X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (B\u1ed3 T\u00e1t), and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as B\u1ed3 T\u00e1t Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to confiscate Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the back fence and finding safety at the U.S. Operations Mission next door. Nhu's men managed to confiscate \u0110\u1ee9c's charred heart.The location chosen for the self-immolation, in front of the Cambodian embassy, raised questions as to whether it was coincidence or a symbolic choice. Trueheart and embassy official Charles Flowerree felt that the location was selected to show solidarity with the Cambodian government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. South Vietnam and Cambodia had strained relations: in a speech on 22 May, Sihanouk had accused Di\u1ec7m of mistreating Vietnamese and ethnic minority Khmer Buddhists. The pro-Di\u1ec7m Times of Vietnam published an article on 9 June which claimed that Cambodian monks had been encouraging the Buddhist crisis, asserting it was part of a Cambodian plot to extend its neutralist foreign policy into South Vietnam. Flowerree noted that Di\u1ec7m was \"ready and eager to see a fine Cambodian hand in all the organized Buddhist actions\".\n\n\n=== Di\u1ec7m reaction ===\n\nDi\u1ec7m made a radio address at 19:00 on the day of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's death, asserting that he was profoundly troubled by the event. He appealed for \"serenity and patriotism\", and announced that stalled negotiations would resume with the Buddhists. He claimed that negotiations had been progressing well and in a time of religious tension emphasized the role of the Roman Catholic philosophy of personalism in his rule. He alleged that extremists had twisted the facts and he asserted that the Buddhists can \"count on the Constitution, in other words, me.\"The ARVN responded to the appeal, putting on a show of solidarity behind Di\u1ec7m to isolate dissident officers. Thirty high-ranking officers headed by General L\u00ea V\u0103n T\u1ef5 declared their resolve to carry out all missions entrusted to the army for the defense of the constitution and the Republic. The declaration was a veneer which masked a developing plot to oust Di\u1ec7m. Some of the signatories were to become personally involved in Di\u1ec7m's overthrow and death in November. Generals D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh and Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4n, the presidential military advisor and the chief of the army who were to lead the coup, were overseas.Madame Nhu (a Catholic convert from Buddhism and the wife of Di\u1ec7m's younger brother and chief adviser Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu), who was regarded as the First Lady of South Vietnam at the time (as Di\u1ec7m was a bachelor), said she would \"clap hands at seeing another monk barbecue show\". Later that month, Di\u1ec7m's government charged that Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c had been drugged before being forced to commit suicide. The regime also accused Browne of bribing Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c to burn himself.\n\n\n=== Political and media impact ===\nPhotographs taken by Malcolm Browne of the self-immolation quickly spread across the wire services and were featured on the front pages of newspapers worldwide. The self-immolation was later regarded as a turning point in the Buddhist crisis and a critical point in the collapse of the Di\u1ec7m regime.Historian Seth Jacobs asserted that Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c had \"reduced America's Di\u1ec7m experiment to ashes as well\" and that \"no amount of pleading could retrieve Di\u1ec7m's reputation\" once Browne's images had become ingrained into the psyche of the world public. Ellen Hammer described the event as having \"evoked dark images of persecution and horror corresponding to a profoundly Asian reality that passed the understanding of Westerners.\" John Mecklin, an official from the U.S. embassy, noted that the photograph \"had a shock effect of incalculable value to the Buddhist cause, becoming a symbol of the state of things in Vietnam.\" William Colby, then chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's Far East Division, opined that Di\u1ec7m \"handled the Buddhist crisis fairly badly and allowed it to grow. But I really don't think there was much they could have done about it once that bonze burned himself.\"\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy, whose government was the main sponsor of Di\u1ec7m's regime, learned of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's death when handed the morning newspapers while he was talking to his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, on the phone. Kennedy reportedly interrupted their conversation about segregation in Alabama by exclaiming \"Jesus Christ!\" He later remarked that \"no news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one.\" U.S. Senator Frank Church (D-ID), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, claimed that \"such grisly scenes have not been witnessed since the Christian martyrs marched hand in hand into the Roman arenas.\"In Europe, the photographs were sold on the streets as postcards during the 1960s, and communist China distributed millions of copies of the photograph throughout Asia and Africa as evidence of what it called US imperialism. One of Browne's photographs remains affixed to the sedan in which Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c was riding and is part of a tourist attraction in Hu\u1ebf.\nFor Browne and the AP, the pictures were a marketing success. Ray Herndon, the United Press International (UPI) correspondent who had forgotten to take his camera on the day, was harshly criticized in private by his employer. UPI estimated that 5,000 readers in Sydney, then a city of around 1.5\u20132 million, had switched to AP news sources.Di\u1ec7m's English-language mouthpiece, the Times of Vietnam, intensified its attacks on both journalists and Buddhists. Headlines such as \"X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i politburo makes new threats\" and \"Monks plot murder\" were printed. One article questioned the relationship between the monks and the press by posing the question as to why \"so many young girls are buzzing in and out of X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i early [in the day]\" and then going on to allege that they were brought in for sexual purposes for the U.S. reporters.Browne's award-winning photograph of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's death has been reproduced in popular media for decades, and the incident has been used as a touchstone reference in many films and television programs.\nA still photograph of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's self-immolation taken by Browne was used for the cover of American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine's debut album which came out in 1992, as well as the cover of their single \"Killing in the Name\".\n\n\n=== Precedents and influence ===\nDespite the shock of the Western public, the practice of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Hu\u1ebf in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c.\n\nAfter Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c, five more Buddhist monks self-immolated up until late October 1963 as the Buddhist protests in Vietnam escalated. On 1 November, the ARVN overthrew Di\u1ec7m in a coup. Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were assassinated the next day. Monks have followed Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's example since for other reasons.\u0110\u1ee9c's actions were copied by United States citizens in protests against the Vietnam War:\n\nAlice Herz, an 82-year-old longtime peace activist, self-immolated on March 16, 1965, on a street in Detroit, Michigan.\nNorman Morrison, a 31-year-old Quaker pacifist, poured kerosene over himself and set himself alight below the third-floor window of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara at the Pentagon on 2 November 1965.\nRoger Allen LaPorte burned himself to death outside the United Nations building in New York City on 9 November 1965.\nFlorence Beaumont self-immolated outside the Federal Building in Los Angeles on 15 October 1967.\nGeorge Winne, Jr., a student, self-immolated on 10 May 1970 on the campus of the University of California, San Diego, and died the following day.In an apparently non-political case of imitation of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c, the young son of an American officer based at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. He was seriously burned before the fire was extinguished and later could only offer the explanation that \"I wanted to see what it was like.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of civil rights leaders\nList of political self-immolations\nSelf-immolation protests by Tibetans in China\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\u2013 Official Buddhist monastery dedicated to Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c",

'Ho Chi Minh City urban railway project') is a planned rapid transit network that will serve Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. \nIts first metro line, Line 1, started construction in 2012 and is scheduled for completion in 2021. As of 2019, most of the network is in the planning stages, with projects for different lines advancing as funds become available.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier proposals (2001\u20132012) ===\n\nThe network was first proposed in 2001 as part of a comprehensive public transport network plan including Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring provinces, with the aim of avoiding the severe traffic congestion problems that have affected other Asian cities (such as Hanoi).According to the original master plan submitted in February 2001, the metro system would comprise six lines. The plan was originally expected to cost US$1.5 billion over 10 years, as part of a US$3.35 billion program to build a rail network serving Ho Chi Minh City and surrounding provinces.The plan was revised in 2007 and proposed no less than six urban rail lines. The city\u2019s transport development master plan to 2020 envisages developing three monorail or light rail lines with a total length of 37 kilometres (23 mi) and six underground metro routes with a total length of 107 kilometres (66 mi). B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh Market in District 1, already a major hub for bus traffic, will become a major hub connecting several lines.\n\n\n=== Revised plan and construction (2013\u2013present) ===\n\nThe latest plans for Ho Chi Minh City Metro is a revised version of the earlier proposal in 2007 was approved in 8 April 2013.\nThe network's first line, connecting B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh Market and Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, was originally scheduled for completion in 2014. A groundbreaking ceremony for Line 1 was held on 21 February 2008. However, due to funding issues, construction only started in 2012, pushing the project completion date to 2018.In September 2013 an agreement was reached with the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the Spanish Government to provide \u20ac850 million to finance the construction of line 5 - with any additional cost funded by the Vietnamese Government.  A revised construction start of 2015 was provided.On 13 September 2017, the authorities announced that Line 1 will be delayed for two years. Cost overrun, audits and delayed payments to contractors contributed to the delay. The targeted completion date is now set at 2020. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily upon launch, increasing to 635,000 by 2030 and 800,000 by 2040. All stations along the route are expected to accommodate the disabled, with automatic ticket vending machines, telephone booths, restrooms, subway doors and information bulletins accessible to the handicapped and visually impaired.\nOn 28 January 2019, MAUR Director of Project Management Unit, Duong Huu Hoa stated that construction progress of Line 1, as of December 2018 has reached 62%, below the target of 65%. The project has been criticised in the local press for its repeated delays.Construction of  Line 2 was initially scheduled to begin in 2013, with operations beginning in 2018. However, on 13 September 2017, the local authorities have requested to the Prime Minister to push back the construction of the second line to 2020 with completion in 2024. As of February 2020, the expected opening date for the first line is the end of 2021.  No reason was given for the delay. The estimated cost of the line has also ballooned from $1.3 billion to more than $2.1 billion. \n\n\n== Lines ==\n\nThe plan also includes 3 lines of tramway and monorail:\n\n\n== Fares and ticketing ==\nTo encourage high ridership, fares on the Ho Chi Minh City Metro network will be set low, on the order of VND 2,500 (about US$0.11). By comparison, bus fares within the city are generally VND 3,000 (as of 2013, bus fares are at around VND 5,000 to VND 7,000 ). A common farecard, valid on both the metro network and bus network, will be made available as well.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTransport in Vietnam\nHanoi Metro\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nReferences\nBibliographyMVA Asia Ltd (October 2006). \"Preparing the Ho Chi Minh City Metro Rail System Project: Technical Assistance Reports\" (PDF).

        "wiki": "Bitexco Financial Tower (Vietnamese: Th\u00e1p T\u00e0i ch\u00ednh Bitexco) is a skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At its completion in 2010, it became the tallest building in Vietnam and kept this status until January 2011, when it was surpassed by Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower.  With 68 floors above ground and three basements, the building has a height of 262.5 metres (861 ft), making it the second tallest building in the city, fifth tallest in Vietnam, and the 263rd tallest in the world, as of the beginning of 2018.The tower is owned by Bitexco Group, a Vietnamese multi-industry corporation, with a focus on real estate development. The building also houses the Ho Chi Minh City office of Bitexco Group, while its headquarters are in Hanoi.The tower was designed by Carlos Zapata, Design Principal and Founder of Carlos Zapata Studio, with French company AREP as architect of record.  Designer Zapata, who was born in Venezuela but is based in New York City, drew inspiration for this skyscraper's unique shape from Vietnam's national flower, the Lotus.The tower was officially inaugurated on 31 October 2010.  In 2013, CNN.com named the Bitexco Financial Tower one of the 25 Great Skyscraper Icons of Construction. And in 2015, Thrillist.com named the Bitexco Financial Tower the #2 Coolest Skyscraper in the World.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was held in September 2005. Two years later, in June 2007, construction of the tower started. The tower topped out in mid-2010 and had its inauguration ceremony on 31 October 2010.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nAmongst other international awards and recognitions, on 30 November 2011, Bitexco Financial Tower received the \"Excellence in structure engineering awards 2011\" in the \"International structure over $100 million\" category. NCSEA.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nBitexco Financial Tower is a mixed use project which includes office, retail, F&B and entertainment space. The tower has around 38,000 square metres of office space, from 7th to 65th floors, and a five-storey retail podium, Icon68, including food court and seven screen multiplex cinema with around 10,000 square metres from Ground to 4th Floors. At Floor 49, at height around 178 metres, there is an observation deck open to the public.\nVietnam's first non-rooftop helipad is on the 52nd floor of the Bitexco Financial Tower. The helipad extends 22 meters out from the main structure. It is strong enough to carry a helicopter up to 3 tons of weight.\n\n\n=== Key design features ===\nGrand Atrium Lobby\nWall & Fa\u00e7ade systemThe glass from Belgium was purchased and shipped to China for manufacturing.  Once in China the low iron heat strengthened glass was cut into 6,000 individual panels.  Each panel is double glazed with the outside layer being 8 mm thick and internal air space of 12 mm and an internal panel of 8 mm.  Finally the glass was shipped to Ho Chi Minh City and the panels were installed as the building grew higher. Each of the 6,000 sleek glass panels enveloping the Bitexco Financial Tower is individually cut to unique specifications because each floor is unique, giving the building its eye-catching shape.\n\nHelipadLocated on the southern side of the Bitexco Financial Tower, the helipad cantilevers from the 52nd floor and resembles a blossoming lotus bud.Constructed from more than 250 tons of structural steel and requiring 4,000 ultra-strong bolts to hold it together, the helipad took almost a year to plan, build and coordinate before it could be hoisted to its place at height around 191 meters.  Its installation alone took about two months.\nMost of the materials used to construct the helipad were purchased from Europe and South Korea and the manufacturing took place in Bu Gang, a city near Seoul. Once the fabrication of the helipad was completed, it was shipped to Vietnam.\nTo ensure proper assembly, the entire helipad was pre-assembled on the ground of a factory in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province in Vietnam \u2013 a process that took about three weeks.\nWhen the helipad was ready to be lifted into place, the roads surrounding the southern face of the Bitexco Financial Tower were closed for safety reasons and the helipad was transported into the centre of District 1.  The massive yet delicate operation of lifting the helipad began.  It was lifted in parts and attached to the 52nd storey of the Bitexco Financial Tower, 191 meters above Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nVertical TransportationBitexco Financial Tower operates Otis double-deck elevators with specialised Compass System which is the most modern and advanced elevator system in Vietnam. With speed up to 7 meters per second, it was the fastest lift system in South East Asia at the time of installation. There are 3 separate elevator zones servicing the tower with 14 passenger and 2 service lifts, plus further lifts to serve the retail and parking areas.\n\nSaigon Skydeck on 49th floorThe Saigon Skydeck soft opened for visitors from overseas and domestically on 1 January 2011, officially opening in July that same year. The observation deck offers 360-degree panoramic views of Ho Chi Minh City, guest facilities and a gift shop. Saigon Skydeck opens daily and a ticket costs around $10.\n\n\n=== Floor plan ===\nThe following is the breakdown of floors.\n\n\n== Office demand in Ho Chi Minh City ==\nDue to the rapid economic growth of Saigon in particular and dynamic economic development of Vietnam in general, the construction of office buildings in Ho Chi Minh City has been rapid. Bitexco Financial Tower has fulfilled the need for international standard office space in this city. The unit price of prime grade offices now in Saigon can be up to US$40/metre square/per month or more, for the most demanded space. Since the opening up and growth of the Vietnamese economy, both foreign and domestic enterprises have invested significantly in the construction of high-rise buildings in Vietnam. Before 1995, Saigon city centre featured generally French Colonial and other rather basic low-lying buildings. Since then, the city has seen a dramatic increase in high-rise buildings as the country has often maintained an average 8\u20138.5% annual GDP growth rate. Saigon, the country's economic hub, has achieved 12% GDP growth rate, at some times, although this has been dampened in recent years by the general world recession but not as greatly as has been felt in other parts of the world.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Vietnam\nMenara Telekom\nLandmark 81\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20111228045302/http://www.bitexco.com.vn/real-estate-investment/bitexco-financial-tower\nOfficial website\nhttp://saigonskydeck.com/\nhttp://travel.cnn.com/explorations/life/20-most-iconic-skyscrapers-343149?page=0,0\nhttp://www.realestatejournal.com/columnists_com/blueprint/20070301-blueprint.html\nAbout the project but the information is not updated as the investor has changed the design\narticle on Asia Times Online\nView of Saigon Skyline from Bitexco Building",

        "wiki": "Little Saigon is a name given to ethnic enclaves of expatriate Vietnamese mainly in English-speaking countries. Alternate names include Little Vietnam and Little Hanoi (mainly in historically communist nations), depending on the enclave's political history. Saigon is the former name of the capital of the former South Vietnam (now Ho Chi Minh City), where a large number of first-generation Vietnamese immigrants arriving to the United States originate, whereas Hanoi is the current capital of Vietnam.\nThe most well-established and largest Vietnamese-American enclaves, not all of which are called Little Saigon, are in Orange County, California; San Jose, California; and Houston, Texas. Somewhat-smaller communities also exist, including the comparatively nascent Vietnamese commercial districts in San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta, Sacramento, Denver, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex (Haltom City, Arlington, and Garland), Falls Church, Virginia, Orlando, and Seattle.\nAdditionally, Vietnamese-Americans and Vietnamese-Canadians also established businesses and bringing distinctively Vietnamese elements to most Chinatowns; some examples include the Chinatowns of Las Vegas, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Houston, Honolulu and Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n\n\n=== California ===\n\n\n==== Orange County ====\n\nThe oldest, largest, and most prominent Little Saigon is centered in Orange County, California, where over 189,000 Vietnamese Americans reside. With other Southern California counties, this region constitutes the largest Vietnamese American (VA) population outside of Vietnam. The community originally started emerging in Westminster, and quickly spread to the adjacent city of Garden Grove. Today, these two cities rank as the highest concentration of Vietnamese-Americans of any cities in the United States at 37.1% and 31.1%, respectively (according to the 2011 American Community Survey).\nAbout 45 miles (72 km) south of Los Angeles, Westminster was once a predominantly white middle-class suburban city of Orange County with ample farmland, but the city later experienced a decline by the 1970s. Since 1978, the nucleus of Little Saigon has long been Bolsa Avenue, where early pioneers Danh Quach and Frank Jao established businesses. During that year, the well-known Nguoi Viet Daily News also began publishing from a home in Garden Grove. Other new Vietnamese-American arrivals soon revitalized the area by opening their own businesses in old, formerly white-owned storefronts, and investors constructed large shopping centers containing a mix of businesses. The Vietnamese community and businesses later spread into adjacent Garden Grove, Stanton, Fountain Valley, Anaheim, and Santa Ana.\nIn Orange County, Little Saigon is now a wide, spread-out community dotted with myriad suburban-style strip malls containing a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese-Vietnamese businesses. It is located southwest of Disneyland between the State Route 22 and Interstate 405. However, the main focus of Little Saigon is Bolsa Avenue (where Asian Garden Mall and Little Saigon Plaza are considered the heart), which runs through Westminster; the street was officially designated Little Saigon by the city council of Westminster in the late 1980s. The borders of Little Saigon can be considered to be Trask Ave. and W McFadden Ave. on the north and south and Euclid St. and Magnolia St. on the east and west, respectively. About three-quarters of the population in this area are Vietnamese.\n\nWestminster is generally considered the main cultural center of the Vietnamese American community with several Vietnamese-language television stations, radio stations, and newspapers originating from Little Saigon and adjacent areas. At least one radio station broadcast 24 hours a day in Vietnamese and 4 television substations broadcasting in Vietnamese 24 hours a day as of 2009, and several newspapers serve the Vietnamese-American community. Little Saigon has also emerged as the prominent center of the Vietnamese pop music industry with several recording studios, and with a recording industry many times larger than in Vietnam itself. Vietnamese music recorded in Westminster are distributed and sold in Vietnamese communities throughout the United States and in Australia, France, and Germany as well as illegally in Vietnam.Garden Grove Park is the location of an annual Vietnamese Lunar New Year festival held in late January - early February known as T\u1ebft. Small amusement park rides, dances, and contests are held in Garden Grove Park which is across the street from Bolsa Grande High School grounds and is hosted by the Union of Vietnamese Student Association (UVSA). Since 2013, the annual festival has been relocated to the OC Fair Grounds in Costa Mesa.\nThe Vietnamese American population has now begun to diffuse from Little Saigon to traditionally working-class Hispanic cities, such as Santa Ana, and southward to professional middle-class predominantly white cities such as Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Irvine, and Orange. Over the years, the vibrant community of Little Saigon has experienced frequent openings and closures of small mom-and-pop Vietnamese businesses, resulting in sights of some abandoned strip plazas. The changing landscape of the Vietnamese American population would bring a more multicultural flavor to Orange County, but as with Chinatowns, could potentially eliminate its identity as a \"Little Saigon\" as the population of foreign-born Vietnamese old-timers declines and more younger generations of Vietnamese American families attune to mainstream American culture (especially with a preference for fashionable malls over the Vietnamese ethnic malls in Little Saigon) and move on to affluent communities further away from the Little Saigon area.\n\n\n==== San Diego ====\n\nWhen the \"first wave\" of Vietnamese immigrants started to arrive in 1981, many settled in the communities adjacent to San Diego State University, such as City Heights and Talmadge, better known as East San Diego. As families and individuals became more affluent however, many relocated to other communities in the city: Linda Vista, Clairemont, Serra Mesa, etc. (Central San Diego) and what was then brand-new tract communities such as Mira Mesa, Rancho Penasquitos, Rancho Bernardo, etc.\nWith a population of about 35,000, the San Diego metropolitan area ranks as one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the United States. Because of the Vietnamese population's unique migration patterns in the city, it does not have a huge concentration of Vietnamese businesses in a particular area like other metropolitan areas (e.g., Westminster, San Jose, Houston, etc.) Still, there are three notable Vietnamese business districts in the San Diego region: Mira Mesa Blvd. (North San Diego), El Cajon Blvd. (East San Diego), and Convoy Street/Linda Vista Road (Central San Diego).\nThe area on El Cajon Boulevard in East San Diego will be getting official City of San Diego status as \"Little Saigon San Diego\", as referenced on the web page littlesaigonsandiego.org.\nOn June 4, 2013, City Council approved Little Saigon Cultural and Commercial District in City Heights, San Diego, which is a six-block section of El Cajon Boulevard from Euclid to Highland avenues. On February 1, 2019, Little Saigon signs were revealed to be installed on Interstate 15.\n\n\n==== San Gabriel Valley ====\n\nDue to the large influx and presence of relatively poor ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam in the 1980s (which also coincided with the arrival of immigrant elite from Taiwan and Hong Kong), the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles has another important concentration of Vietnamese in Southern California. While not generally referred to as \"Little Saigon\", the stretch of Garvey Avenue in the working-class barrios of Rosemead, California, South El Monte, California, and El Monte, California have a relatively heavy but scattered collection of businesses owned mainly by majority ethnic Chinese Vietnamese with a growing number of ethnic Vietnamese residents and business owners as well. Many of these businesses are housed in tiny strip malls whereas others occupy freestanding, aging buildings. These Vietnamese businesses are very gradually replacing businesses owned by Hispanics.\nRosemead is the Vietnamese center of the San Gabriel Valley. One particular shopping center in Rosemead, called Diamond Square, is anchored by the Taiwanese American chain 99 Ranch Market (now closed) and contains various Chinese Vietnamese small businesses and a food court catering to local Asians. The Diamond Square is now closed and is replaced by The Square anchored by Korean American stores. The 99 Ranch Market is replaced by the Square Supermarket.\nIt remains a major hub for working-class Vietnamese and Mainland Chinese expatriates residing in the area.\nMany Vietnamese of ethnic Chinese origin also tend to own countless businesses - especially supermarkets, restaurants, beauty parlors, and auto repair shops - in the main general mixed-Chinese commercial thoroughfares of Garvey Avenue in Monterey Park, California and Valley Boulevard in Alhambra, California, San Gabriel, California, and Rosemead. There are already several ph\u1edf and banh mi eateries represented along Valley Boulevard.\nThe Sriracha hot sauce manufacturer Huy Fong Foods (known for its rooster logo and found in countless Vietnamese restaurants) is owned by a Chinese Vietnamese refugee named David Tran and was originally located in Chinatown, Los Angeles but it relocated to its larger facility in Rosemead.\nIn 2005, John Tran became the first Vietnamese American to be elected to a seat on the city council of Rosemead. Since 2006, he has been the mayor of the city, a position that is held by rotation among the council members.\n\n\n==== San Jose ====\nComprising over 180,000 residents, about 10.6% of the population, (as of the 2010 U.S. Census) San Jose's Vietnamese community is comparable to the one in Orange County. San Jose has more Vietnamese residents than any single city outside of Vietnam. It is currently under construction to expand the \u2018town\u2019 and construction is almost finished. Vietnamese-language radio programs from Orange County are rebroadcast in the region, though San Jose does contain locally produced Vietnamese-language radio and TV stations such as Que Huong Media, Vien Thao, and Vietoday TV. Although Viet Mercury, the Vietnamese-language edition of the San Jose Mercury News, is now discontinued, many other publications offer Vietnamese literature enjoyed by the community, such as Thang Mo and Trieu Thanh magazines as well as newspapers from Calitoday, Viet Bao, Thoi Bao Daily News (now defunct), and Viet Nam Nhat Bao (Vietnam Daily News). Several strip malls on Tully Road (stretching from Senter Road to Quimby Road) and Senter Road (from Capitol Expressway to Burke Street by Costco), cater to Vietnamese tastes, such as Lion Plaza on the intersection of Tully and King (anchored by Lion Supermarket) and Carribbees Center on Senter and Lewis (anchored by Cho Senter Market, now Lee's Supermarket). The epicenter of the Vietnamese-American community of San Jose, however, is on Story Road (stretching from Senter Road to McLaughlin Avenue), home to the popular Grand Century Mall and Vietnam Town (both shopping malls are owned by Chinese-Vietnamese real estate developer Lap Tang) and is officially designated by the San Jose City Council as \"Little Saigon\". Like its counterpart in Orange County, a freeway offramp sign was placed in 2013 on Highway 101 and Freeway 280, designating the Story Road (from Highway 101) and McLaughlin Avenue (from Freeway 280) exits to Little Saigon. Lee's Sandwiches, (a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich chain eatery) as well as the ph\u1edf chain, Pho Hoa Restaurant, had their first locations here in San Jose. Due to the ethnic diversity of the city, where Vietnamese-Americans here live side by side with other ethnic minorities such as Mexican-Americans, Filipino-Americans, and Indian-Americans, the Vietnamese community in San Jose is more fully integrated into the local community.\nThe Vietnamese community of San Jose has been politically divided over the naming of the business district, with various groups favoring \"Little Saigon\", \"New Saigon\", and \"Vietnamese Business District\". Non-Vietnamese businesses and residents, as well as the San Jose Hispanic Chamber of Commerce have also opposed the name \"Little Saigon\". In November 2007, the San Jose City Council voted 8-3 to choose the compromise name \"Saigon Business District\", resulting in ongoing protest, debate, and an effort to recall city council member Madison Nguyen, who proposed the name \"Saigon Business District\". On March 4, 2008, after a public meeting in which more than 1000 \"Little Saigon\" supporters participated, the city council voted 11-1 to rescind the name \"Saigon Business District\", but stopped short of renaming it. The recall of Nguyen failed in March 2009.\nSan Jose also granted the building of the Viet Museum in Kelley Park next to the City Historic Museum. The Viet Museum had its grand opening August 25, 2007.\n\n\n==== Sacramento ====\nWith a large and growing Vietnamese American population, in February 2010, a stretch of Stockton Boulevard in Sacramento from Florin Road to Fruitridge Road has been officially named \"Little Saigon\". Although settlement of Vietnamese refugees began during the 1980s, large numbers of Vietnamese have moved from the San Jose area to the Sacramento area since the late 1990s and 2000s (decade) (especially after the dot-com bust in Silicon Valley). People were drawn to the area by lower housing prices, lower cost of living, and Vietnamese and Chinese enclaves. The large Asian supermarket Shun Fat Supermarket (a small Southern California-based chain owned by a Chinese Vietnamese American) opened in 2000 to cater to the local community and anchors Pacific Plaza. One of the First Vietnamese-Chinese owned supermarkets was Vinh Phat Supermarket. SF Supermarket is a prominent fixture at the intersections of 65th and Stockton Boulevard. This center also houses Huong Lan, which is famous for Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. In 2010, a new 99 Ranch Market opened on Florin Road. The strip of Stockton Boulevard has a great number of Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants and many places for ethnic foods, such as ph\u1edf and boba. There are nearby Vietnamese Chinese shopping centers planned for development, including Little Saigon Plaza (to be anchored by a supermarket) that is to be developed by prominent San Jose-based Vietnamese American developers. Other current shopping centers sport names such as Little Vietnam and Pacific Rim Plaza. As a testament to the area's burgeoning Vietnamese community, the Southgate branch (66th avenue, near Stockton Blvd) of Sacramento Public library carries a large collection of Vietnamese materials.\n\n\n==== San Francisco ====\n\nIn early 2004, San Francisco officially designated Larkin Street between Eddy and O'Farrell streets as \"Little Saigon\" (S\u00e0i G\u00f2n Nh\u1ecf). Located in the Tenderloin district where 2,000 of the city's 13,000 Vietnamese-American residents live, the two-block stretch is more than 80% Vietnamese-owned. Unlike San Jose, with its larger ethnic Vietnamese population, the ethnic Chinese from Vietnam are well represented in San Francisco due to self-segregation. Banners and directional signs have already been posted. A formal symbolic entrance was erected in July 2008, akin to those for San Francisco's Japantown and Chinatown (albeit smaller).\n\n\n==== Oakland ====\nMany of Oakland's Vietnamese businesses are concentrated along International Boulevard and East 12th Street in the San Antonio district. From 1st Avenue to 23rd Avenue is known as Little Saigon of Oakland. Most business owners and property owners in this area are Vietnamese refugees after the fall of Saigon. Yellow Vietnamese Freedom flags and the signs of Welcome to Little Saigon Oakland are visible everywhere.\n\n\n==== Elsewhere ====\nLarge concentrations of Vietnamese live in Central districts of Los Angeles, although are outnumbered by other Asians and even more numerous Latinos. Unofficially, Riverside County, Fresno and Oxnard has some Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Colorado ===\nA growing Vietnamese commercial district has emerged on Federal Boulevard between the Far East Center shopping complex between West Alameda and West Mississippi Avenues in Denver, Colorado, with Vietnamese cuisine eateries and various businesses. In 2014, with the leadership of business owners, the Vietnamese American Community of Colorado, Denver Asian Pacific Commission and Denver City Councilman Paul Lopez, the Little Saigon Business District was formed honoring its rich Vietnamese culture. There is also a growing Vietnamese population in Aurora, Colorado, specifically in an area bordered to the north by Alameda Avenue, to the south by E. Hampden Avenue, to the east by Chambers Road, and to the west by Havana Street. There are currently about 21,000 Vietnamese people living in the Denver-Aurora-Boulder Metro Area.\n\n\n=== Florida ===\nA thriving Vietnamese quarter called \"Little Saigon\" exists in the Colonialtown district of Orlando, Florida. The neighborhood has become a landmark in the city of Orlando and consist of a countless, and always growing, number of restaurants, groceries, and Vietnamese professional offices that serve the local Vietnamese community with everything from taxes to medical and dental care. Stores supply Asian pop-culture to the community in the form of karaoke bars, Bubble tea shops, Vietnamese video and music shops, and stores featuring candies and collectibles from across Asia. The heart of the district is the intersection of East Colonial Drive/HWY50 and Mills Ave, also known as the \"Vi-Mi\" district.\nThe Orlando Vietnamese community has its roots in war refugees seeking a new life in America after the fall of Saigon. Notable pro-democracy activists, such as Thuong Nguyen Foshee, who was just recently released from prison in Vietnam, call Orlando their home.\nThe Vietnamese Community in Orlando, along with institutions like Long Van Temple, St. Philip Phan Van Minh Church, Vietnamese Baptist Church, and groups such as The Vietnamese Association of Central Florida, strive to maintain their heritage as well as share their culture with the rest of Orlando. Annual events, such as the numerous Tet New Year Celebrations at the Central Florida Fairgrounds and across the city, help spread Vietnamese culture and promote diversity throughout Orlando.\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\nThere are many Vietnamese businesses located in the mixed-Asian \u2013 that is, co-existing with ethnic Korean and Chinese businesses \u2013 commercial and cultural strip of Buford Highway in Doraville and Chamblee, which are working-class suburbs of Atlanta. Although a fair number of post-war Vietnamese refugees settled in Atlanta earlier, many Vietnamese Americans from California and other parts of the United States have been relocating into the Atlanta area and making a fairly large presence since the 1990s. Atlanta is home to one of the fastest-growing Vietnamese populations in the world.\n\n\n=== Gulf Coast ===\nIt is estimated that there are 40,000 Vietnamese-Americans in the Gulf Coast, and 1 in every 4 fishermen from the area is Vietnamese-American.\n\n\n==== Alabama ====\nVietnamese-Americans make up one-third of the population in the fishing hamlet of Bayou La Batre. A majority of the community work in the seafood industry, while a smaller percentage work in the shipbuilding industry. The eastern side of the city is nicknamed \"Little Vietnam\" due to the high number of Vietnamese-American residents. Vietnamese businesses have been sustained by the social integration of the Vietnamese and mainstream's cultures. The city also sees, within the Vietnamese American community, a large sub-community of Amerasians. Many were brought to the US through the Amerasian Homecoming Act and relocated to the area due to similarities in environment and industry to what they were accustomed to.\n\n\n==== Louisiana ====\n\nLouisiana is home to many Vietnamese, many of whom especially engaged in traditional fishing. Both Louisiana and Vietnam had been French colonies. New Orleans has several areas with a concentration of Vietnamese-American businesses. The largest among these communities is located around Village de L'Est, which includes significant community and commercial institutions such as Mary Queen of Vietnam Church and Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery.\nThere is a Vietnamese business section in Baton Rouge, located near the 12000 block of Florida Blvd (Hwy 190), which consists of restaurants, grocery stores, and other various businesses, even found throughout some other sections of the city.\nIn 2008, Anh \"Joseph\" Cao made history after being elected to Congress as a Republican from Louisiana's heavily Democratic 2nd congressional district, which includes most of New Orleans. Cao served one term, and was the first person of Vietnamese ancestry ever elected to the U.S. Congress.\n\n\n==== Mississippi ====\nA small \"Little Saigon\" can be found on Oak Street in Biloxi. Many Vietnamese-Americans relocated to southern Mississippi due to the similar environment and industry they were accustomed to back in Vietnam. The Vietnamese-American labor force in this area is usually spread between the fishing, gambling, and shipbuilding industries.\n\n\n=== Illinois ===\n\nArgyle Street in the city of Chicago contains a Little Saigon district, and it has become the hub of vibrant Vietnamese culture in the city. It is referred to by Chicagoans as the \"New Chinatown\", little Saigon, or most commonly Argyle.  Argyle is easily accessible from the CTA Red Line's Argyle station.\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\nDorchester, Massachusetts, a neighborhood of Boston, is home to a major Vietnamese business center in the Northeast. It serves some 75,000 Vietnam-born Americans in the Boston-Worcester area as well as those in surroundings states such as Connecticut and Rhode Island.  Communities there are served by a number of Viet-organized social service agencies (such as The Southeast Asian Coalition in Worcester Viet-AID, the Vietnamese American Initiative for Development) and some religious and publicly funded organizations.  Native Vietnamese who speak fluent Vietnamese, whether or not they live in Boston, are recruited for work here.\nThe \"X\" in Springfield is a magnet for Vietnamese businesses and the locus of Vietnamese settlement in western Massachusetts, including restaurants, businesses and a Vietnamese community center.\n\n\n=== Missouri ===\nKansas City is home to more than 10,000 Vietnamese immigrants. A sizable Vietnamese population along Independence Avenue & Garrison Square sprung up various businesses including ph\u1edf restaurants, nail salons, hair salons, video gift stores, cell phone stores, pool halls and jewelry stores. One of the new \"Little Saigons\" can now be found on North Oak Trafficway in Kansas City Gladstone neighborhood.\nSt. Louis also has a large Vietnamese immigrant population. The majority of restaurants and stores are in \"South City\" on or near Grand Ave.\n\n\n=== Michigan ===\n\nWhile not titled a \"Little Saigon\", the suburban community of Madison Heights in the Detroit area has become a center of Vietnamese commerce. Located on John R Road and on Dequindre Road, several Vietnamese markets, Ph\u1edf noodle soup restaurants, movie/music stores, several nail supply stores, herbal store and beauty salons have cropped up along two streets.\nBesides Madison Heights, the Grand Rapids and Holland areas have a small Vietnamese enclave.\nInkster has a neighborhood known as \"Little Saigon\" This refers to the Vietnam war and not Vietnamese people. \"Little Saigon\" is a collection of housing projects along Inkster Rd. and Annapolis where bullet holes and boarded windows are common.\n\n\n=== New Mexico ===\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico has a small \"Little Saigon\" community with various Vietnamese restaurants and businesses on and around Central Avenue in the city's International District.\n\n\n=== New York ===\nNew York City's unofficial \"Little Saigon\" Vietnamese community exists near the intersection of the Bowery and Grand Street. Although small compared with nearby Chinatown, the area is differentiated by the large presence of Vietnamese stores as compared with Chinese stores.\n\n\n=== North Carolina ===\nIn Charlotte, Central Avenue (near Briar Creek Road) is the original \"Chinatown\" consisting of \"Saigon Square\" and a pair of other Chinese/Vietnamese shopping plazas that include \"Dim Sum Restaurant\" (which serves New York-style dim sum), the \"Eang Hong Supermarket\", \"Van Loi\" (which serves cha shao), and a dozen or so other stores.\nSaigon Square has various Vietnamese (albeit not Chinese) stores including Ph\u1edf H\u00f2a (Vietnamese noodles).\nAsian Corner Mall on North Tryon Street and Sugar Creek Road, developed from the defunct Tryon Mall in 1999, with \"Dragon Court Restaurant\", \"Hong Kong BBQ\", \"International Supermarket\", and \"New Century Market\" and several other Chinese/Vietnamese stores.\nThere are also areas in Greensboro where Vietnamese-run businesses (including stores and restaurants) are prevalent.\n\n\n=== Oklahoma ===\nOklahoma City has a significant Vietnamese American business district and ethnic neighborhood located in the center part of the city. While it is officially known as Asian District by the city, due to the abundant Asian diversity of the neighborhood (similar in many respects to International District in Seattle), much of the original Little Saigon portion centers along Military Dr. and NW 23rd St. between N. Classen Blvd. and N. Shartel Ave.\nTens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees were relocated to Oklahoma City during the 1980s. Over time, they have established businesses in a gentrified area to the west of the Uptown NW 23rd and Classen Blvd. business districts and the area begun to be known as a Little Saigon.\nThe original Little Saigon area features numerous ph\u1edf caf\u00e9s, Vietnamese bakeries and restaurants, and Asian supermarkets. There are also numerous hopping nightclubs, karaoke, and videobars joining the growing list of Chinese, Thai, Filipino, and Korean residents and establishments that make up the remainder of surrounding Asian District.\nThe district is very popular with local residents and students from nearby Oklahoma City University providing a colorful and authentic taste of the far east without leaving the heartland of America. Oklahoma City's original Little Saigon neighborhood was featured in the New York Times as well as National Geographic's March 2003 issue's ZipUSA series titled \"73106: Lemongrass on the Prairie\".\n\n\n=== Oregon ===\n10,641 Vietnamese Americans live in the Portland area. Many Vietnamese restaurants, markets, and other businesses in Portland can be found on NE Sandy Boulevard, SE Powell Boulevard, and NE and SE 82nd Avenue. There are also some Vietnamese business around the Portland area such as Beaverton, Hillsboro, Aloha, and Tigard.\n\n\n=== Pennsylvania ===\n\nSouth Philadelphia near the Italian Market has a large Vietnamese American population. Many Vietnamese businesses tucked in strip malls have emerged on Washington Avenue to service the local immigrant population. The Vietnamese sandwich banh mi is gaining much attention in Philadelphia and is now competing with the Philly Cheesesteak.As of 2005, Vietnamese are projected to become the largest ethnicity in South Philadelphia. Philadelphia is in the top ten cities with Vietnamese populations and Vietnamese immigration destinations. Philadelphia even has a higher percentage and numerical population of Vietnamese than New York City, one of few Asian backgrounds that shy from New York.\n\n\n=== Tennessee ===\nMemphis has a significant Vietnamese community, affectionately known as \"Little Hanoi\" located along Cleveland Avenue in Midtown.  The community includes many Vietnamese restaurants and shops, as well as a Vietnamese Buddhist temple and areas of predominantly Vietnamese housing.  Little Hanoi is one of the last and largest non-Hispanic immigrant enclaves in the Memphis metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Texas ===\n\n\n==== Austin ====\nAustin has a Chinatown Center composed mainly of Vietnamese business on North Lamar.\n\n\n==== Houston ====\n\nHome to 150,000 Vietnamese people. A section of Midtown Houston known as \"Little Saigon\" or \"Vietnamtown\" was the original commercial district home for the Vietnamese community in Houston. The boundaries are IH 69/US 59, Preston Street, St. Joseph Parkway and Emancipation Avenue. Vietnamese street signs denote the area since 1998. In 2004, this area was officially named \"Little Saigon\" by the city of Houston. The redevelopment of Midtown Houston from run-down to upscale increased property values and property taxes, forcing many Vietnamese-American businesses out of the neighborhood into other areas.The largest Vietnamese commercial district is now found in Houston (Alief), a strip along Bellaire Boulevard west of Chinatown, Houston, with most Vietnamese-owned businesses and restaurants centered at the Hong Kong City Mall on Bellaire and Boone (anchored by Hong Kong Food Market and Ocean Palace Restaurant).\nSince the Vietnamese District is adjacent to Houston's Chinatown, it is often confused to be part of the same neighborhood. The Vietnamese and the Chinese district are each their own individual neighborhood, however. Even though the area is primarily Vietnamese and Chinese, there is also a large amount of Filipino Americans, Arab Muslims, Indonesian Americans, and Pakistani Americans in the area, as well as a sizable amount of African Americans, whom were once the majority in the Little Saigon area prior to the Vietnam War.\n\n\n==== Dallas\u2013Fort Worth (DFW) ====\nIn addition to the ones listed here, several unofficial Little Saigons are located in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex. Dallas is also considered another one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the United States, along with its sister city, Fort Worth.\n\nOne Little Saigon is located in Garland, along Walnut Street between Audelia Road and Jupiter Road. This one is the largest, consisting of four large supermarkets (Hiep Thai, New Truong Nguyen, Hong Kong, and Thuan Phat at Cali Saigon Mall in Garland). Each supermarket listed below is located in a different shopping complex and has a number of restaurants.\nHiep Thai: northeast corner of Jupiter and Walnut.\nNew Truong Nguyen: northwest corner of Jupiter and Walnut.\nHong Kong: southwest corner of Audelia and Walnut.\nThuan Phat Supermarket/Cali Saigon Mall: northeast corner of Jupiter Road and Beltline Road (in Garland borders with city of Richardson)\nThe restaurants in the area are Bistro B, La Me, Doan, Pho 95, Pho Bang, SaiGon Kitchen, Nam Hua, Saigon Block, Pho Tay Do, Pho Que Huong, Pho Bac, Pho Pasteur, Huong Ly (in Richardson), and many more.\nAnother one is located in Arlington, on Pioneer Parkway. This Little Saigon includes a couple supermarkets (Saigon-Taipei, Hong Kong), restaurants, and Vietnamese karaoke/caf\u00e9 bars.\nThe third one is in Irving on Beltline Road, with Little Saigon Mall. A small concentration of Vietnamese restaurants are being built on MacArthur and Beltline through Las Colinas and Valley Ranch. These restaurants are unique, infusing Korean, Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Chinese influences.\nThere are also a number Vietnamese strip malls along Beltline in Carrollton. Though the area is predominantly Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean shops and churches can be found there, as well.\nHaltom City (on E Belknap St.) with many grocery stores, restaurants, and other stores.Vietnamese businesses are also found in Richardson and Haltom City.\n\n\n=== Virginia ===\n\nLittle Saigon, Arlington, in Clarendon, served as the Little Saigon of the Washington, D.C. region, reaching its heyday following the Fall of Saigon during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many Vietnamese refugees immigrated to the Washington D.C. due to the proximity to the nation's capital, and existing social, family, and business connections. This neighborhood was home to commercial uses of Vietnamese grocery stores, restaurants, department stores, cafes, and entertainment to serve the large Vietnamese population. Business was attractive to Vietnamese immigrants in this neighborhood due to the depressed rents during the time of construction of the WMATA Clarendon metro station. This neighborhood was a destination for Vietnamese immigrants both in the Washington D.C. area, as well as throughout the mid-Atlantic.The Washington, D.C., suburb of Seven Corners in Fairfax County, Virginia, is now home to the largest Vietnamese American population and cultural center on the eastern seaboard. While there is no full-fledged \"Little Saigon\" to speak of, the most prominent hub for local-area Vietnamese is the shopping mall called the Eden Center, complete with a garden and an arch signifying its entrance.\n\n\n=== Washington ===\n\n\n==== Seattle ====\n\nSeattle has a significant, prosperous Vietnamese American business district centered at 12th Avenue and Jackson Street, immediately east of the city's considerably older Chinatown district. This Vietnamese area has not been officially designated a \"Little Saigon\", although a few street signs with this name have been erected. Rather, the area \u2013 along with the Chinatown district \u2013 has retained the longstanding name International District (now officially Chinatown/International District, but often just \"The I.D.\"), dating back to the late 1940s. The predominantly Chinese and predominantly Vietnamese areas are separated from one another by an Interstate 5 viaduct, but there is easy pedestrian and car access between the two.\n\n\n==== Tacoma ====\nTacoma, as well, has an area commonly known as the \"Lincoln International District\", which is almost entirely filled with Vietnamese restaurants, grocers, and shops. Though officially not known as \"Little Saigon\", the area is normally referred to as such by the local resident population.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n\n\"Sapa\", fully \"TTTM Sapa\" also called as \"Little Hanoi\" or \"Prague Hanoi\" is a Vietnamese trading center and market in Czechia capital city Prague, Libu\u0161 neighborhood.\n\n\n==== France ====\nIn southern France, a \"Little Vietnam\" in Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot which housed 1,160 Vietnamese refugees in a refugee camp faces demolition after being in existence since 1956.  The location has been in neglect where 120 families still live in shacks who are third and fourth generations of the people affected by World War II.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Melbourne the suburb of Richmond has a large proportion of Vietnamese-Australians, Victoria Street is often nicknamed Little Saigon. Other Vietnamese communities are centered around Springvale Road in Springvale, most parts of Footscray and also in St Albans. In Sydney they are concentrated in Bankstown, Cabramatta, Canley Vale and Villawood.\nIn Adelaide, Vietnamese are concentrated arounds Woodville in particular along Hanson Road.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLittle Vietnam\nLittle Hanoi\nSaigon\nSouth Vietnam\nChinatown\nJapantown\nKoreatown\nVietnamese Australian\nVietnamese American\nVietnamese Canadian\nList of U.S. cities with large Vietnamese American populations\nOh, Saigon\nOverseas Vietnamese (Viet Kieu)\nLittle Germany (disambiguation)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-06/local/me-12402_1_garden-grove\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-12/local/me-32940_1_vietnamese-gang-members\nhttps://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2015/08/28/44250/art-show-explores-past-future-of-vietnamese-in-ora/\nhttps://ocweekly.com/new-exhibit-captures-complexities-of-vietnamese-in-orange-county-6477083/\nhttps://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/05/new-exhibit-combines-art-and-history-to-tell-vietnamese-stories/\nhttps://www.nguoi-viet.com/little-saigon/VIETNAMESE-FOCUS-trien-lam-cong-dong-ti-nan-sau-40-nam-3641/\nhttps://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/24/generations-of-stories-artifacts-photos-and-a-tattered-map-piece-together-history-of-the-vietnamese-who-settled-here/\nhttps://voiceofoc.org/2015/09/little-saigon-understands-what-syrian-refugees-are-going-through/\nhttps://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/world/2015/09/150914_viet_focus_exhibition_usa\n\n\n== External links ==\nLittle Saigon News\nThe Fall and Rise of Saigon from the Orange County Register\nTown Hall in Little Saigon (Wednesday, June 25) Interviews with several Orange County Little Saigon community and business leaders on NPR's KPCC\nBlog about happenings in Little Saigon\nPictures of Little Saigon in Melbourne\nAsianWeek: Big Plans for Little Saigon - In-depth article on the development of Little Saigon in Orange County, California.\nAn Advisory Services Panel Report on Little Saigon - Urban Land Institute",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (; Vietnamese: [h\u00f2 c\u01d0 m\u012b\u014b\u031f] (listen), Saigon: [h\u00f2 c\u01d0 m\u0268\u0304n]; Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m: \u80e1\u5fd7\u660e; 19 May 1890 \u2013 2 September 1969), born Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung, also known as Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c, B\u00e1c H\u1ed3, or simply B\u00e1c ('Uncle', pronounced [\u0294\u0253a\u02d0k\u031a\u02e6\u02e5]), was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician. He served as Prime Minister of Vietnam from 1945 to 1955 and President from 1945 to 1969. Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist, he served as Chairman and First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Vietnam.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh led the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the Communist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, ending the First Indochina War. He was a key figure in the People's Army of Vietnam and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng during the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975. Democratic Republic of Vietnam was victorious against the United States and was reunified with the Republic of South Vietnam in 1976. Saigon, the former capital of South Vietnam, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honor. Ho officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems and died in 1969.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's life before he came to power in Vietnam is ambiguous. He is known to have used between 50 to 200 pseudonyms. His birth is subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely.Aside from being a politician, Ho was also a writer, a poet and a journalist. He wrote several books, articles and poems in French, Chinese and Vietnamese.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was born as Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung in 1890 in the village of Ho\u00e0ng Tr\u00f9 (the name of the local temple near L\u00e0ng Sen), his mother's village. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years: 1891, 1892, 1894 and 1895. From 1895, he grew up in his father Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh S\u1eafc (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Huy)'s village of L\u00e0ng Sen, Kim Li\u00ean, Nam \u0110\u00e0n, and Ngh\u1ec7 An Province. He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the French Army; his brother Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a geomancer and traditional herbalist; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Ho) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. He quickly mastered Chinese writing, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism, while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing. In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name at the age of 10: Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t Th\u00e0nh (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Accomplished\").\nHis father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe (Qui Nh\u01a1n). He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the cane as punishment for an infraction. His father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy, but he refused because it meant serving the French. This exposed Th\u00e0nh (Ho) to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province. Nevertheless, he received a French education, attending Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc (lyc\u00e9e or secondary education) in Hu\u1ebf. His disciples, Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, also attended the school, as did Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the future President of South Vietnam (and political rival).\n\n\n=== First sojourn in France ===\nPreviously, it was believed that Th\u00e0nh (Ho) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-corv\u00e9e) demonstration of poor peasants in Hu\u1ebf in May 1908, which endangered his student status at Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc. However, a document from the Centre des archives d'Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-corv\u00e9e demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908). The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese Communist leaders, as shown in North Vietnamese President T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng's falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea revolt.\nLater in life, he claimed the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged, but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School in 1911 undermines this version of events, in which he stated that he left school to go abroad. Because his father had been dismissed, he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward, taking a position at D\u1ee5c Thanh school in Phan Thi\u1ebft for about six months, then traveled to Saigon.He worked as a kitchen helper on a French steamer, the Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville, using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in Marseille, France on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for Le Havre and Dunkirk, returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School, but his application was rejected. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from 1911 to 1917.\n\n\n=== In the United States ===\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City (Harlem) and Boston, where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the Parker House Hotel. The only evidence that he was in the United States is a letter to French colonial administrators dated 15 December 1912 and postmarked New York City (he gave as his address Poste Restante in Le Havre and his occupation as a sailor) and a postcard to Phan Chu Trinh in Paris where he mentioned working at the Parker House Hotel. Inquiries to the Parker House management revealed no records of his ever having worked there. Among a series of menial jobs, he claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in Brooklyn between 1917 and 1918 and for General Motors as a line manager. It is believed that while in the United States he made contact with Korean nationalists, an experience that developed his political outlook. Sophie Quinn-Judge states that this is \"in the realm of conjecture\". He was also influenced by Pan-Africanist and Black nationalist Marcus Garvey during his stay and said he attended meetings of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\n\n\n=== In Britain ===\n\nAt various points between 1913 and 1919, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) claimed to have lived in West Ealing and later in Crouch End, Hornsey. He reportedly worked as either a chef or dish washer (reports vary) at the Drayton Court Hotel in West Ealing. Claims that he trained as a pastry chef under Auguste Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, Westminster are not supported by documentary evidence. The wall of New Zealand House, home of the New Zealand High Commission, which now stands on the site of the Carlton Hotel, displays a blue plaque. During 1913, Th\u00e0nh was also employed as a pastry chef on the Newhaven\u2013Dieppe ferry route.\n\n\n== Political education in France ==\n\nFrom 1919 to 1923, Th\u00e0nh (Ho) began to show an interest in politics while living in France, being influenced by his friend and Socialist Party of France comrade Marcel Cachin. Th\u00e0nh claimed to have arrived in Paris from London in 1917, but the French police only had documents recording his arrival in June 1919. In Paris he joined the Groupe des Patriotes Annamites (The Group of Vietnamese Patriots) that included Phan Chu Trinh, Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ebf Truy\u1ec1n and Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh. They had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for Vietnamese independence under the pseudonym Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Patriot\") prior to Th\u00e0nh's arrival in Paris. The group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the Vietnamese people in French Indochina to the Western powers at the Versailles peace talks, but they were ignored. Citing the principle of self-determination outlined prior to the peace accords, they requested the allied powers to end French colonial rule of Vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government.\nPrior to the conference, the group sent their letter to allied leaders, including Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and President Woodrow Wilson. They were unable to obtain consideration at Versailles, but the episode would later help establish the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the symbolic leader of the anti-colonial movement at home in Vietnam. Since Th\u00e0nh was the public face behind the publication of the document (although it was written by Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng), he soon became known as Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c and first used the name in September during an interview with a Chinese newspaper correspondent.Many authors have stated that 1919 was a lost \"Wilsonian moment\", where the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh could have adopted a pro-American and less radical position if only President Wilson had received him. However, at the time of the Versailles Conference, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was committed to a socialist program. While the conference was ongoing, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c was already delivering speeches on the prospects of Bolshevism in Asia and was attempting to persuade French Socialists to join Lenin's Communist International.In December 1920, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) became a representative to the Congress of Tours of the Socialist Party of France, voted for the Third International and was a founding member of the French Communist Party. Taking a position in the Colonial Committee of the party, he tried to draw his comrades' attention towards people in French colonies including Indochina, but his efforts were often unsuccessful. While living in Paris, he reportedly had a relationship with a dressmaker named Marie Bri\u00e8re. As discovered in 2018, Qu\u1ed1c also had relations with the members of Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea like Kim Kyu-sik while in Paris.During this period, he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as running his Vietnamese nationalist group. In May 1922, he wrote an article for a French magazine criticizing the use of English words by French sportswriters. The article implored Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 to outlaw such Franglais as le manager, le round and le knock-out. His articles and speeches caught the attention of Dmitry Manuilsky, who would soon sponsor his trip to the Soviet Union and under whose tutelage he would become a high-ranking member of the Soviet Comintern.\n\n\n== In the Soviet Union and China ==\n\nIn 1923, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) left Paris for Moscow carrying a passport with the name Chen Vang, a Chinese merchant, where he was employed by the Comintern, studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East and participated in the Fifth Comintern Congress in June 1924 before arriving in Canton (present-day Guangzhou), China in November 1924 using the name Ly Thuy.\nIn 1925\u20131926, he organized \"Youth Education Classes\" and occasionally gave socialist lectures to Vietnamese revolutionary young people living in Canton at the Whampoa Military Academy. These young people would become the seeds of a new revolutionary, pro-communist movement in Vietnam several years later. According to William Duiker, he lived with a Chinese woman, Zeng Xueming (T\u0103ng Tuy\u1ebft Minh), whom he married on 18 October 1926. When his comrades objected to the match, he told them: \"I will get married despite your disapproval because I need a woman to teach me the language and keep house\". She was 21 and he was 36. They married in the same place where Zhou Enlai had married earlier and then lived in the residence of a Comintern agent, Mikhail Borodin.Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Ch\u00ed argued that in June 1925 he betrayed Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, the famous leader of a rival revolutionary faction and his father's old friend, to French Secret Service agents in Shanghai for 100,000 piastres. A source states that he later claimed he did it because he expected Ch\u00e2u's trial to stir up anti-French sentiment and because he needed the money to establish a communist organization. In Ho Chi Minh: A Life, William Duiker considered this hypothesis, but ultimately rejected it. Other sources claim that Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Huy\u1ec7n was responsible for Chau's capture. Chau, sentenced to lifetime house arrest, never denounced Qu\u1ed1c.\nAfter Chiang Kai-shek's 1927 anti-Communist coup, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) left Canton again in April 1927 and returned to Moscow, spending part of the summer of 1927 recuperating from tuberculosis in Crimea before returning to Paris once more in November. He then returned to Asia by way of Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland and Italy, where he sailed to Bangkok, Thailand, arriving in July 1928. \"Although we have been separated for almost a year, our feelings for each other do not have to be said to be felt\", he reassured Minh in an intercepted letter. In this period, he served as a senior agent undertaking Comintern activities in Southeast Asia.\n\nQu\u1ed1c (Ho) remained in Thailand, staying in the Thai village of Nachok until late 1929, when he moved on to India and then Shanghai. In Hong Kong in early 1930, he chaired a meeting with representatives from two Vietnamese Communist parties to merge them into a unified organization, the Communist Party of Vietnam. In June 1931, he was arrested. To reduce French pressure for extradition, he was reported as dead in 1932. The British quietly released him in January 1933. He moved to the Soviet Union and in Moscow studied and taught at the Lenin Institute. In this period he reportedly lost his positions in the Comintern because of a concern that he had betrayed the organization. However, according to Ton That Thien's research, he was a member of the inner circle of the Comintern, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Dmitry Manuilsky and a member in good standing of the Comintern throughout the Great Purge.In 1938, Qu\u1ed1c (Ho) returned to China and served as an advisor to the Chinese Communist armed forces. He was also the senior Comintern agent in charge of Asian affairs. He worked extensively in Chungking and traveled to Guiyang, Kunming and Guilin. He was using the name H\u1ed3 Quang during this period.\n\n\n== Independence movement ==\nIn 1941, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement. The Japanese occupation of Indochina that year, the first step toward invasion of the rest of Southeast Asia, created an opportunity for patriotic Vietnamese. The so-called \"men in black\" were a 10,000 member guerrilla force that operated with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. He oversaw many successful military actions against the Vichy France and Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II, supported closely yet clandestinely by the United States Office of Strategic Services and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946\u20131954). He was jailed in China by Chiang Kai-shek's local authorities before being rescued by Chinese Communists. Following his release in 1943, he returned to Vietnam. It was during this time that he began regularly using the name H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, a Vietnamese name combining a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"Bright spirit\" or \"Clear will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e: Ch\u00ed meaning \"will\" or \"spirit\" and Minh meaning \"bright\"). His new name is a tribute to General Hou Zhiming (\u4faf\u5fd7\u660e), Chief Commissar of the 4th Military Region of the National Revolutionary Army, who helped releasing him from KMT prison in 1943.\n\nIn April 1945, he met with the OSS agent Archimedes Patti and offered to provide intelligence to the allies provided that he could have \"a line of communication\" with the Allies. The OSS agreed to this and later sent a military team of OSS members to train his men and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh himself was treated for malaria and dysentery by an OSS doctor.Following the August Revolution (1945) organized by the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became Chairman of the Provisional Government (Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although he convinced Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to abdicate, his government was not recognized by any country. He repeatedly petitioned President Harry S. Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.In 1946, future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became acquainted when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. He offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam. Ben-Gurion declined, telling him: \"I am certain we shall be able to establish a Jewish Government in Palestine\".In 1946, when he traveled outside of the country, his subordinates imprisoned 2,500 non-Communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed or exiled in July 1946, notably members of the Nationalist Party of Vietnam and the Dai Viet National Party after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the Viet Minh government. All rival political parties were hereafter banned and local governments were purged to minimize opposition later on. However, it was noted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's first Congress had over two-thirds of its members come from non-Vi\u1ec7t Minh political factions, some without an election. Nationalist Party of Vietnam leader Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ea3i Th\u1ea7n was named vice president. They also held four out of ten ministerial positions.\n\n\n=== Birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ===\nFollowing Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication on 2 September 1945, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh read the Declaration of Independence of Vietnam under the name of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In Saigon, with violence between rival Vietnamese factions and French forces increasing, the British commander, General Sir Douglas Gracey, declared martial law. On 24 September, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh leaders responded with a call for a general strike.In September 1945, a force of 200,000 Republic of China Army troops arrived in Hanoi to accept the surrender of the Japanese occupiers in northern Indochina. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh made a compromise with their general, Lu Han, to dissolve the Communist Party and to hold an election which would yield a coalition government. When Chiang forced the French to give the French concessions in Shanghai back to China in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina, he had no choice but to sign an agreement with France on 6 March 1946 in which Vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union. The agreement soon broke down. The purpose of the agreement, for both the French and Vietminh, was for Chiang's army to leave North Vietnam. Fighting broke out in the North soon after the Chinese left.\nHistorian Professor Liam Kelley of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on his Le Minh Khai's SEAsian History Blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh said he \"would rather smell French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for a thousand,\" noting that Stanley Karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to him in his 1983 Vietnam: A History and that the original quote was most likely forged by the Frenchman Paul Mus in his 1952 book Vietnam: Sociologie d'une Guerre. Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam (although this was the time when China invaded Tibet). The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.\n\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of the Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946, and of the Trotskyists. Trotskyism in Vietnam did not rival the Party outside of the major cities, but particularly in the South, in Saigon-Cochinchina, they had been a challenge. From the outset, they had called for armed resistance to a French restoration and for an immediate transfer of industry to workers and land to peasants. The French Socialist leader Daniel Guerin recalls that when in Paris in 1946 he asked H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh about the fate of the Trotskyist leader T\u1ea1 Thu Th\u00e2u, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh had replied, \"with unfeigned emotion,\" that \"Th\u00e2u was a great patriot and we mourn him, but then a moment later added in a steady voice \u2018All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.\u2019\"The Communists eventually suppressed all non-Communist parties, but they failed to secure a peace deal with France. In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the Dalat and Fontainebleau conferences, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by French forces at Hanoi only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The bombardment of Haiphong reportedly killed more than 6000 Vietnamese civilians. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Ho Chi Minh declared war against the French Union, marking the beginning of the Indochina War. The Vietnam National Army, mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked. They assaulted the French positions, smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper, destroying armored vehicles with \"lunge mines\" (a hollow-charge warhead on the end of a pole, detonated by thrusting the charge against the side of a tank; typically a suicide weapon) and Molotov cocktails, holding off attackers by using roadblocks, landmines and gravel. After two months of fighting, the exhausted Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces withdrew after systematically destroying any valuable infrastructure. Ho was reported to be captured by a group of French soldiers led by Jean-\u00c9tienne Valluy at Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc in Operation Lea. The person in question turned out to be a Vi\u1ec7t Minh advisor who was killed trying to escape.\nAccording to journalist Bernard Fall, Ho decided to negotiate a truce after fighting the French for several years. When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Ho expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of a number of Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.In February 1950, after the successful removal of the French border blockade, he met with Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in Moscow after the Soviet Union recognized his government. They all agreed that China would be responsible for backing the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. Mao Zedong's emissary to Moscow stated in August that China planned to train 60,000\u201370,000 Viet Minh in the near future. The road to the outside world was open for Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces to receive additional supplies which would allow them to escalate the fight against the French regime throughout Indochina. At the outset of the conflict, Ho reportedly told a French visitor: \"You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and I will win\". In 1954, the First Indochina War came to an end after the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu, where more than 10,000 French soldiers surrendered to the Viet Minh. The subsequent Geneva Accords peace process partitioned North Vietnam at the 17th parallel.\nArthur Dommen estimates that the Vi\u1ec7t Minh killed between 50,000 and 100,000 civilians during the war. However, Smedberg estimates that there were less than 150,000 civilian casualties. By comparison to Dommen's calculation, Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000\u2013250,000 civilian deaths.\n\n\n== Becoming president ==\n\nThe 1954 Geneva Accords concluded between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, allowing the latter's forces to regroup in the North whilst anti-Communist groups settled in the South. His Democratic Republic of Vietnam relocated to Hanoi and became the government of North Vietnam, a Communist-led one-party state. Following the Geneva Accords, there was to be a 300-day period in which people could freely move between the two regions of Vietnam, later known as South Vietnam and North Vietnam. During the 300 days, Di\u1ec7m and CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Di\u1ec7m's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan \"God has gone south\". Between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people migrated to the South, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Di\u1ec7m in temporary control of the South.All the parties at Geneva called for reunification elections, but they could not agree on the details. Recently appointed Vi\u1ec7t Minh acting foreign minister Pham Van Dong proposed elections under the supervision of \"local commissions\". The United States, with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, suggested United Nations supervision. This plan was rejected by Soviet representative Vyacheslav Molotov, who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and non-communist members, which could determine \"important\" issues only by unanimous agreement. The negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification. North Vietnam argued that the elections should be held within six months of the ceasefire while the Western allies sought to have no deadline. Molotov proposed June 1955, then later softened this to any time in 1955 and finally July 1956. The Diem government supported reunification elections, but only with effective international supervision, arguing that genuinely free elections were otherwise impossible in the totalitarian North. By the afternoon of 20 July, the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and the elections for a reunified government should be held in July 1956, two years after the ceasefire. The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam was only signed by the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military commands, with no participation or consultation of the State of Vietnam. Based on a proposal by Chinese delegation head Zhou Enlai, an International Control Commission (ICC) chaired by India, with Canada and Poland as members, was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire. Because issues were to be decided unanimously, Poland's presence in the ICC provided the Communists with effective veto power over supervision of the treaty. The unsigned Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference called for reunification elections, which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections, insisting that the ICC's \"competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties\". Of the nine nations represented, only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration. Undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith delivered a \"unilateral declaration\" of the United States position, reiterating: \"We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to ensure that they are conducted fairly\".\n\nBetween 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which were accompanied by significant political repression. During the land reform, testimonies by North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which if extrapolated would indicate a nationwide total of nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was mainly concentrated in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions was widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although it was likely greater than 13,500.\n\n\n== The Vietnam War ==\nAs early as June 1956 the idea of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government was presented at a politburo meeting. In 1959, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh began urging the Politburo to send aid to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng in South Vietnam and a \"people's war\" on the South was approved at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. North Vietnam invaded Laos in July 1959 aided by the Pathet Lao and used 30,000 men to build a network of supply and reinforcement routes running through Laos and Cambodia that became known as the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail. It allowed the North to send manpower and material to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng with much less exposure to South Vietnamese forces, achieving a considerable advantage. To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng was stressed in Communist propaganda. North Vietnam created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 as a \"united front\", or political branch of the Viet Cong intended to encourage the participation of non-Communists.At the end of 1959, conscious that the national election would never be held and that Diem intended to purge opposing forces (mostly ex Vi\u1ec7t Minh) from the South Vietnamese society, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh informally chose L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n to become the next party leader. This was interpreted by Western analysts as a loss of influence for H\u1ed3, who was said to actually have preferred the more moderate V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p for the position. From 1959 onward, the elderly Ho became increasingly worried about the prospect of his death, and that year he wrote down his will. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was officially named party leader in 1960, leaving H\u1ed3 to function in a secondary role as head of state and member of the Politburo. He nevertheless maintained considerable influence in the government. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, T\u1ed1 H\u1eefu, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng often shared dinner with H\u1ed3, and all of them remained key figures throughout and after the war. In the early 1960s, the North Vietnamese Politburo was divided the \"North first\" faction who favored focusing on the economic development of North Vietnam, and the \"South first\" faction, who favored a guerrilla war in South Vietnam to reunite Vietnam in the near future.Between 1961 and 1963, 40,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated into South Vietnam from the North. In 1963, H\u1ed3 purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Diem in hopes of achieving a negotiated peace. During the so-called \"Maneli Affair\" of 1963, a French diplomatic initiative was launched with the aim of achieving a federation of the two Vietnams, which would be neutral in the Cold War. The four principle diplomats involved in the \"Maneli affair\" were Ramchundur Goburdhun, the Indian Chief Commissioner of the ICC; Mieczys\u0142aw Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC; Roger Lalouette, the French ambassador to South Vietnam; and Giovanni d'Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam. Maneli reported that Ho was very interested in the signs of a split between President Diem and President Kennedy and that his attitude was: \"Our real enemies are the Americans. Get rid them, and we can cope with Diem and Nhu afterward\".At a meeting in Hanoi held in French, Ho told Goburdhun that Diem was \"in his own way a patriot\", noting that Diem had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time Goburdhun met Diem \"shake hands with him for me\". The North Vietnamese Premier Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, speaking on behalf of Ho, told Maneli he was interested in the peace plan, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam \"we can come to an agreement with any Vietnamese\". On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man to Diem to discuss the French peace plan. It remains unclear if the Ngo brothers were serious about the French peace plan or were merely using the possibility of accepting it to blackmail the United States into supporting them at a time when the Buddhist crisis had seriously strained relations between Saigon and Washington. Supporting the latter theory is the fact that Nhu promptly leaked his meeting with Maneli to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who publicized it in a column entitled \"Very Ugly Stuff\". The mere possibility that the Ngo brothers might accept the peace plan helped persuade the Kennedy administration to support the coup against them. On 1 November 1963, a coup overthrow Diem, who was killed the next day together with his brother.\nDiem had followed a policy of \"deconstructing the state\" by creating a number of overlapping agencies and departments who were encouraged to feud with one another in order to disorganize the South Vietnamese state to such an extent that he hoped that it would make a coup against him impossible. When Diem was overthrown and killed, without any kind of arbiter between the rival arms of the South Vietnamese state, South Vietnam promptly disintegrated. The American Defense Secretary Robert McNamara reported after visiting South Vietnam in December 1963 that \"there is no organized government worthy of the name\" in Saigon. At a meeting of the plenum of the Politburo in December 1963, L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n's \"South first\" faction triumphed with the Politburo passing a resolution calling for North Vietnam to complete the overthrow of the regime in Saigon as soon as possible while the members of the \"North first\" faction were dismissed. As South Vietnam descended into chaos, whatever interest Ho might had in the French peace plan ended as it become clear it was possible for the Viet Cong to overthrow the government in Saigon. A CIA report from 1964 stated the factionalism in South Vietnam had reached \"almost the point of anarchy\" as various South Vietnamese leaders fought one another, making any sort of effort against the Viet Cong impossible, which was rapidly taking over much of the South Vietnamese countryside.As South Vietnam collapsed into factionalism and in-fighting while the Viet Cong continued to win the war, it became increasingly apparent to President Lyndon Johnson that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam. Though Johnson did not wish to commit American forces until he had won the 1964 election, he decided to make his intentions clear to Hanoi. In June 1964, the \"Seaborn Mission\" began as J. Blair Seaborn, the Canadian commissioner to the ICC, arrived in Hanoi with a message from Johnson offering billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition in exchange for which North Vietnam would cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn also warned that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing, saying that Johnson was seriously considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Little came of the back channel of the \"Seaborn Mission\" as the North Vietnamese distrusted Seaborn, who pointedly was never allowed to meet Ho.In late 1964, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) combat troops were sent southwest into officially neutral Laos and Cambodia. By March 1965, American combat troops began arriving in South Vietnam, first to protect the airbases around Chu Lai and Da Nang, later to take on most of the fight as \"[m]ore and more American troops were put in to replace Saigon troops who could not, or would not, get involved in the fighting\". As fighting escalated, widespread aerial and artillery bombardment all over North Vietnam by the United States Air Force and Navy began with Operation Rolling Thunder. On 8-9 April 1965, Ho made a secret visit to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. It was agreed that no Chinese combat troops would enter North Vietnam unless the United States invaded North Vietnam, but that China would send support troops to North Vietnam to help maintain the infrastructure damaged by American bombing. There was a deep distrust and fear of China within the North Vietnamese Politburo, and the suggestion that Chinese troops, even support troops, be allowed into North Vietnam, caused outrage in the Politburo. Ho had to use all his moral authority to obtain the Politburo's approval.According to Chen Jian, during the mid-to-late 1960s, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n permitted 320,000 Chinese volunteers into North Vietnam to help build infrastructure for the country, thereby freeing a similar number of PAVN personnel to go south. There are no sources from Vietnam, the United States, or the Soviet Union that confirm the number of Chinese troops stationed in North Vietnam. However, the Chinese government later admitted to sending 320,000 Chinese soldiers to Vietnam during the 1960s and spent over $20 billion to support Hanoi's regular North Vietnamese Army and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng guerrilla units.To counter the American bombing, the entire population of North Vietnam was mobilized for the war effort with vast teams of women being used to repair the damage done by the bombers, often at a speed that astonished the Americans. The bombing of North Vietnam proved to be the principle obstacle to opening peace talks as Ho repeatedly stated that no peace talks would be possible unless the United States unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam. Like many of the other leaders of the newly independent states of Asia and Africa, Ho was extremely sensitive about threats, whatever perceived or real, to his nation's independence and sovereignty. Ho regarded the American bombing as a violation of North Vietnam's sovereignty, and he felt that to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to bomb North Vietnam should he not behave as they wanted him to do, would diminish North Vietnam's independence.In March 1966, a Canadian diplomat, Chester Ronning, arrived in Hanoi with an offer to use his \"good offices\" to begin peace talks. However, the Ronning mission foundered upon the bombing issue, as the North Vietnamese demanded an unconditional halt to the bombing, an undertaking that Johnson refused to give. In June 1966, Janusz Lewandowski, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC, was able via d'Orlandi to see Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the American ambassador to South Vietnam, with an offer from Ho. Ho's offer for a \"political compromise\" as transmitted by Lewandowski included allowing South Vietnam to maintain its alliance with the U.S, instead of becoming neutral; having the Viet Cong \"take part\" in negotiations for a coalition government, instead being allowed to automatically enter a coalition government; and allowing a \"reasonable calendar\" for the withdrawal of American troops instead of an immediate withdrawal. Operation Marigold as the Lewandowski channel came to be code-named almost led to American-North Vietnamese talks in Warsaw in December 1966, but collapsed over the bombing issue.In January 1967, General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh, the commander of the forces in South Vietnam, returned to Hanoi, to present a plan that became the genesis of the Tet Offensive a year later. Thanh expressed much concern about the Americans invading Laos to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to preempt this possibility, urged an all-out offensive to win the war with a sudden blow. L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n supported Thanh's plans, which were stoutly opposed by the Defense Minister, General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, who preferred to continue with a guerrilla war, arguing that the superior American firepower would ensure the failure of Thanh's proposed offensive. With the Politburo divided, it was agreed to study and debate the issue more.In July 1967, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and most of the Politburo of the Communist Party met in a high-profile conference where they concluded the war had fallen into a stalemate. The American military presence forced the PAVN to expend the majority of their resources on maintaining the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail rather than reinforcing their comrade's ranks in the South. Ho seems to have agreed to Thanh's offensive because he wanted to see Vietnam reunified within his lifetime, and the increasingly ailing Ho was painfully aware that he did not have much time left. With Ho's permission, the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng planned a massive Tet Offensive that would commence on 31 January 1968, with the aim of taking much of the South by force and dealing a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of North Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\nIn early 1969, Ho suffered a heart attack and was in increasingly bad health for the rest of the year. In July 1969, Jean Sainteny, a former French official in Vietnam who knew Ho secretly transmitted a letter to him from President Richard Nixon. Nixon's letter proposed working together to end this \"tragic war\", but also warned that if North Vietnam made no concessions at the peace talks in Paris by 1 November, Nixon would resort to \"measures of great consequence and force\". Ho's reply, which Nixon received on 30 August 1969 made no concessions, as Nixon's threats apparently made no impression on him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot. His father was a scholar and teacher who received a high degree in the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty Imperial examination. H\u1ed3 was taught to master Classical Chinese at a young age. Before the August Revolution, he often wrote poetry in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n (the Vietnamese name for the Chinese writing system). One of those is Poems from the Prison Diary, written when he was imprisoned by the police of the Republic of China. This poetry chronicle is Vietnam National Treasure No. 10 and was translated into many languages. It is used in Vietnamese high schools. After Vietnam gained independence from France, the new government exclusively promoted Ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef (Vietnamese writing system in Latin characters) to eliminate illiteracy. H\u1ed3 started to create more poems in the modern Vietnamese language for dissemination to a wider range of readers. From when he became president until the appearance of serious health problems, a short poem of his was regularly published in the newspaper Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n T\u1ebft (Lunar new year) edition to encourage his people in working, studying or fighting Americans in the new year.\n\nBecause he was in exile for nearly 30 years, H\u1ed3 could speak fluently as well as read and write professionally in French, English, Russian, Cantonese and Mandarin as well as his mother tongue Vietnamese. In addition, he was reported to speak conversational Esperanto. In the 1920s, he was bureau chief/editor of many newspapers which he established to criticize French Colonial Government of Indochina and serving communism propaganda purposes. Examples are Le Paria (The Pariah) first published in Paris 1922 or Thanh Nien (Youth) first published on 21 June 1925 (21 June was named by The Socialist Republic of Vietnam Government as Vietnam Revolutionary Journalism Day). In many state official visits to Soviet Union and China, he often talked directly to their communist leaders without interpreters especially about top secret information. While being interviewed by Western journalists, he used French. His Vietnamese had a strong accent from his birthplace in the central province of Ngh\u1ec7 An, but could be widely understood throughout the country.As President, he held formal receptions for foreign heads of state and ambassadors at the Presidential Palace, but he personally did not live there. He ordered the building of a stilt house at the back of the palace, which is today known as the Presidential Palace Historical Site. His hobbies (according to his secretary V\u0169 K\u1ef3) included reading, gardening, feeding fish (many of which are still living) and visiting schools and children's homes.He is believed by some to have married Zeng Xueming, although only being able to live with her for less than a year.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh remained in Hanoi during his final years, demanding the unconditional withdrawal of all non-Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam. By 1969, with negotiations still dragging on, his health began to deteriorate from multiple health problems, including diabetes which prevented him from participating in further active politics. However, he insisted that his forces in the South continue fighting until all of Vietnam was reunited regardless of the length of time that it might take, believing that time was on his side.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nWith the outcome of the Vietnam War still in question, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh died of heart failure at his home in Hanoi at 9:47 on the morning of 2 September 1969; he was 79 years old. His embalmed body is currently on display in a mausoleum in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square in Hanoi despite his will which stated that he wanted to be cremated.The North Vietnamese government originally announced Ho's death as 3 September. A week of mourning for his death was decreed nationwide in North Vietnam from 4 to 11 September 1969. His funeral was attended by about 250,000 people and 5,000 official guests, which included many international mourners.\nAmong the dignitaries to attend were :\n\n Leader L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam\n President Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Th\u1ecd of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\n Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia\n Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma of Laos\n Premier Alexei Kosygin of the Soviet Union\n President Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia\n Deputy Premier Ignacy Loga-Sowi\u0144ski of Poland\n Politician Erich M\u00fcckenberger of East Germany\n Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer of Romania\n Vice President Li Xiannian of China\n General Secretary of the Communist Party Kenji Miyamoto of JapanRepresentatives from 40 countries and regions were also presented. During the mourning period, North Vietnam received more than 22,000 condolences letters from 20 organizations and 110 countries across the world, such as France, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Zambia, and many others, mostly Socialist countries.\nIt was said that Ho's body was hid, and carried a long way among forests and rivers in a special-designed coffin until Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum was built.\nHe was not initially replaced as president; instead a \"collective leadership\" composed of several ministers and military leaders took over, known as the Politburo. During North Vietnam's final campaign, a famous song written by composer Huy Thuc was often sung by PAVN soldiers: \"B\u00e1c v\u1eabn c\u00f9ng ch\u00fang ch\u00e1u h\u00e0nh qu\u00e2n\" (\"You are still marching with us, Uncle Ho\").During the Fall of Saigon in April 1975, several PAVN tanks displayed a poster with those same words on it. The day after the battle ended, on 1 May, veteran Australian journalist Denis Warner reported that \"When the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon yesterday, they were led by a man who wasn't there\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nHo Chi Minh remains one of the most divisive figures in modern contemporary history.\nThe Vietnamese Socialist Republic has sustained the personality cult of Uncle Ho (B\u00e1c H\u1ed3), the Bringer of Light (Ch\u00ed Minh). It is comparable in many ways to that of Mao Zedong in China and of Kim il-sung and Kim Jong-il in North Korea. There is the embalmed body on view in a massive mausoleum, the ubiquity of his image featured in every public building and schoolroom, and other displays of reverence, some unofficial, that verge on \"worship\". (Ho Chi Minh's image appears on some family altars, and there is at least one temple dedicated to him, built in then-Vi\u1ec7t-C\u1ed9ng-controlled V\u0129nh Long shortly after his death in 1970).\n\nIn The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam (1982) Duiker suggests that the cult of Ho Chi Minh is indicative of a larger legacy, one that drew on \"elements traditional to the exercise of control and authority in Vietnamese society.\" Duiker is drawn to an \"irresistible and persuasive\" comparison with China. As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Ho Chi Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule Cochinchina) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".\n\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of Confucianism, condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (gia truong). The socialist conception of social equality destroyed the Confucian views of class.\n\nYet Duiker argues many were to find the new ideology \"congenial\" precisely because of its similarities with the teachings of the old Master: \"the belief in one truth, embodied in quasi-sacred texts\"; in \"an anointed elite, trained in an all-embracing doctrine and responsible for leading the broad masses and indoctrinating them in proper thought and behavior\"; in \"the subordination of the individual to the community\"; and in the perfectibility, through corrective action, of human nature. All of this, Duiker suggests, was in some manner present in the aura of the new Master, Chi Minh, \"the bringer of light,\" \"Uncle Ho\" to whom \"all the desirable qualities of Confucian ethics\" are ascribed. Under Ho Chi Minh, Vietnamese Marxism developed, in effect, as a kind of \"reformed Confucianism\" revised to meet \"the challenges of the modern era\" and, not least among these, of \"total mobilisation in the struggle for national independence and state power.\"This \"congeniality\" with Confucian tradition was remarked on by Nguyen Khac Vien, a leading Hanoi intellectual of the 1960 and 70s. In Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam Nguyen Khac Vien, saw definite parallels between Confucian and party discipline, between the traditional scholar gentry and Ho Chi Minh's party cadres.A completely different form of the cult of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (and one tolerated by the government with some uneasiness) is his identification in Vietnamese folk religion with the Jade Emperor, who supposedly incarnated again on earth as H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. Today H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums. The first such medium was one Madam Lang in the 1990s, but the cult acquired a significant number of followers through another medium, Madam Xoan. She established on 1 January 2001 \u0110\u1ea1o Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u1eadt H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (the Way of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Buddha) also known as \u0110\u1ea1o B\u00e1c H\u1ed3 (the Way of Uncle H\u1ed3) at \u0111\u1ec1n H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (the Peace Temple) in Ch\u00ed Linh-Sao \u0110\u1ecf district of H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng province. She then founded the Peace Society of Heavenly Mediums (\u0110o\u00e0n \u0111\u1ed3ng thi\u00ean H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh). Reportedly, by 2014 the movement had around 24,000 followers.Yet even when the Vietnamese government's attempt to immortalize Ho Chi Minh was also met with significant controversies and opposition. The regime is sensitive to anything that might question the official hagiography. This includes references to Ho Chi Minh's personal life that might detract from the image of the dedicated \"the father of the revolution\", the \"celibate married only to the cause of revolution\". William Duiker's Ho Chi Minh: A Life (2000) was candid on the matter of Ho Chi Minh's liaisons. The government sought cuts in a Vietnamese translation and banned distribution of an issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review which carried a small item about the controversy.There has been a number of criticisms against him, where his role on the land reforms had led to the death of more than 172,000 people. A large number of Vietnamese, mostly from diaspora communities and those who still live in modern Southern Vietnam, which have strongly opposed the communist government, considered Ho Chi Minh as a leader who led Vietnam to suffer total destruction and a brutal campaign in terrors accordance to communist terrorism, including the instigation of Vietnam War that led to the complete destruction of Vietnamese nation. These claims have received enormous support from the anti-communist and anti-totalitarian groups across the world, which saw Ho Chi Minh, using the mask of \"liberation\", initiated a complete cultural and human genocide inside the country. These claims have been denied by the communist government.\nHo Chi Minh was listed as one of the war criminals in The Black Book of Communism, where he was accused of killing one million Vietnamese.\n\n\n== International influence ==\n\n \nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh is considered one of the most influential leaders in the world. Time magazine listed him in the list of 100 Most Important People of the Twentieth Century (Time 100) in 1998. His thought and revolution inspired many leaders and people on a global scale in Asia, Africa and Latin America during the decolonization movement which occurred after World War II. As a communist, he was one of the international figures who were highly praised in the Communist world.Various places, boulevards and squares are named after him around the world, especially in Socialist states and former Communist states. In Russia, there is a H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square and monument in Moscow, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh boulevard in Saint Petersburg and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square in Ulyanovsk (the birthplace of Vladimir Lenin, a sister city of Vinh, the birthplace of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh). During the Vietnam War the then West Bengal government, in the hands of CPI(M), renamed Harrington Street to Ho Chi Minh Sarani, which is also the location of the Consulate General of the United States of America in Kolkata. According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as many as 20 countries across Asia, Europe, America and Africa have erected statues in remembrance of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh.Busts, statues and memorial plaques and exhibitions are displayed in destinations on his extensive world journey in exile from 1911 to 1941 including France, Great Britain, Russia, China and Thailand.Many activists and musicians wrote songs about H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his revolution in different languages during the Vietnam War to demonstrate against the United States. Spanish songs were composed by F\u00e9lix Pita Rodr\u00edguez, Carlos Puebla and Al\u00ed Primera. In addition, the Chilean folk singer V\u00edctor Jara referenced H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh in his anti-war song \"El derecho de vivir en paz\" (\"The Right to Live in Peace\"). In English, Ewan MacColl wrote \"The Ballad of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh\" and Pete Seeger wrote \"Teacher Uncle Ho\". Russian songs about him were written by Vladimir Fere and German songs about him were written by Kurt Demmler.\nIn 1987, UNESCO officially recommended that its member states \"join in the commemoration of the centenary of the birth of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh by organizing various events as a tribute to his memory\", considering \"the important and many-sided contributions of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to the fields of culture, education and the arts\" who \"devoted his whole life to the national liberation of the Vietnamese people, contributing to the common struggle of peoples for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Essays ===\nBernard B.

        "wiki": "Hanoi is the capital city of Vietnam. It covers an area of 3,358.6 square kilometres (1,297 sq mi). It is the second largest city in Vietnam, with over eight million residents within city proper and an estimated population of 20 million within the metropolitan area. Located in part of the Red River Delta, Hanoi is the commercial, cultural, and educational centre of Northern Vietnam. Having an estimated nominal GDP of US$32.8 billion as of 2018, it is the second most productive economic area of Vietnam, after Ho Chi Minh City.\nThe city is a settlement along the banks of the Red River. In 1010, the monarch L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 founded the city as the imperial capital, naming it Th\u0103ng Long (literally \"Ascending Dragon\"). Th\u0103ng Long would remain the political and cultural centre of Vietnam until 1802, when the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of Vietnam, moved the capital to Hu\u1ebf. The city renamed to Hanoi in 1831, and was the capital of French Indochina from 1883 to 1945. On 6 January 1946, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam designated Hanoi as the capital of the newly-independent country, which would last during the First Indochina War (1946\u20131954) and the Vietnam War (1955\u20131975).\nHanoi has been the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since 1976. It hosts various venerable educational institutions and cultural venues of significance, including the Vietnam National University, the M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium, and the Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts. On 16 July 1999, the UNESCO presented the title \"City for Peace\" to Hanoi. Hanoi joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on 31 October 2019 on the occasion of World Cities' Day.\n\n\n== Names ==\nHanoi had various names throughout history. \n\nIt was known first as Long Bi\u00ean (\u9f8d\u908a, \"dragon edge\"), then T\u1ed1ng B\u00ecnh (\u5b8b\u5e73, \"Song peace\") and Long \u0110\u1ed7 (\u9f8d\u809a, \"dragon belly\"). Long Bi\u00ean later gave its name to the famed Long Bi\u00ean Bridge, built during French colonial times, and more recently to a new district to the east of the Red River. Several older names of Hanoi feature long (\u9f8d, \"dragon\"), linked to the curved formation of the Red River around the city, which was symbolized as a dragon.\nIn 866, it was turned into a citadel and named \u0110\u1ea1i La (\u5927\u7f85, \"big net\"). This gave it the nickname La Th\u00e0nh (\u7f85\u57ce, \"net citadel\"). Both \u0110\u1ea1i La and La Th\u00e0nh are names of major streets in modern Hanoi.\nWhen L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 established the capital in the area in 1010, it was named Th\u0103ng Long (\u6607\u9f8d, \"rising dragon\"). Th\u0103ng Long later became the name of a major bridge on the highway linking the city center to N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i Airport, and the Th\u0103ng Long Boulevard expressway in the southwest of the city center. In modern time, the city is usually referred to as Th\u0103ng Long \u2013 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, when its long history is discussed.\nDuring the H\u1ed3 dynasty, it was called \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (\u6771\u90fd, \"eastern metropolis\").\nDuring the Minh dynasty, it was called \u0110\u00f4ng Quan (\u6771\u95dc, \"eastern gate\").\nDuring the L\u00ea dynasty, Hanoi was known as \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (\u6771\u4eac, \"eastern capital\"). This gave the name to Tonkin and Gulf of Tonkin. A square adjacent to the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake was named \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh Ngh\u0129a Th\u1ee5c after the reformist Tonkin Free School under French colonization.\nAfter the end of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n had expanded further south, the city was named B\u1eafc Th\u00e0nh (\u5317\u57ce, \"northern citadel\").\nMinh M\u1ea1ng renamed the city H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (\u6cb3\u5167, \"inside the rivers\") in 1831. This has remained its official name until modern times.\nSeveral unofficial names of Hanoi include: K\u1ebb Ch\u1ee3 (marketplace), Tr\u00e0ng An (long peace), H\u00e0 Th\u00e0nh (short for Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, \"city of Hanoi\"), and Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u00f4 (capital).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Th\u0103ng Long period ===\n\nHanoi has been inhabited since at least 3000 BC. The C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel in \u0110\u00f4ng Anh District served as the capital of the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c kingdom founded by the Th\u1ee5c emigrant Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n after his 208 BC conquest of the native V\u0103n Lang.\nIn 179 BC, the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c Kingdom was annexed by Nanyue, which ushered in more than a millennium of Chinese domination. By the middle of the 5th century, in the center of ancient Hanoi, the Liu Song dynasty set up a new district (\u7e23, huy\u1ec7n) called Songping (Tong Binh), which later became a commandery (\u90e1, qu\u1eadn), including two districts Yihuai (\u7fa9\u61f7) and Suining (\u7d8f\u5be7) in the south of the Red River (now T\u1eeb Li\u00eam and Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c districts) with a metropolis (the domination centre) in the present inner Hanoi. By the year 679, the Tang dynasty changed the region's name into Annan (Pacified South), with Songping as its capital.In order to defeat the people's uprisings, in the later half of the 8th century, Zhang Boyi (\u5f35\u4f2f\u5100), a Tang dynasty viceroy, built Luocheng (\u7f85\u57ce, La Thanh or La citadel, from Thu Le to Quan Ngua in present-day Ba Dinh precinct). In the earlier half of the 9th century, it was further built up and called Jincheng (\u91d1\u57ce, Kim Thanh or Kim Citadel). In 863, Nanzhao army laid siege of Jincheng and killed 150,000 people in the country. In 866, Chinese jiedushi Gao Pian recaptured the city and drove out the Nanzhao army. He renamed the city to Daluocheng (\u5927\u7f85\u57ce, \u0110\u1ea1i La th\u00e0nh). \u0110\u1ea1i La at the time with approximate 250,000 residents included small foreign communities and residents of Persians, Arabs, Indian, Cham, Javanese and Nestorian Christians, became an important trading center of the Tang Dynasty due to the ransacking of Canton by Huang Chao rebellion.\n\n\n=== Th\u0103ng Long, \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4, \u0110\u00f4ng Quan, \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh ===\n\nIn 1010, L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5, the first ruler of the L\u00fd dynasty, moved the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to the site of the \u0110\u1ea1i La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed the site Th\u0103ng Long (\u6607\u9f8d, \"Soaring Dragon\") \u2013 a name still used poetically to this day. Th\u0103ng Long remained the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t until 1397, when it was moved to Thanh H\u00f3a, then known as T\u00e2y \u0110\u00f4 (\u897f\u90fd), the \"Western Capital\". Th\u0103ng Long then became \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (\u6771\u90fd), the \"Eastern Capital.\"\nIn 1408, the Chinese Minh dynasty attacked and occupied Vietnam, changing \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4's name to Dongguan (Chinese: \u6771\u95dc, Eastern Gateway), or \u0110\u00f4ng Quan in Sino-Vietnamese. In 1428, the Vietnamese overthrew the Chinese under the leadership of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, who later founded the L\u00ea dynasty and renamed \u0110\u00f4ng Quan \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (\u6771\u4eac, \"Eastern Capital\") or Tonkin. Right after the end of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty, it was named B\u1eafc Th\u00e0nh (\u5317\u57ce, \"Northern Citadel\").\n\n\n=== During Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty and the French colonial period ===\n\nWhen the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty was established in 1802, Gia Long moved the capital to Hu\u1ebf. Th\u0103ng Long was no longer the capital, its H\u00e1n t\u1ef1 was changed from \u6607\u9f8d (\"Rising dragon\") to \u6607\u9686 (\"Ascent and prosperity\"), aiming to reduce the sentiment of L\u00ea dynasty. Emperors of Vietnam usually used dragon (\u9f8d long) as a symbol of their imperial strength and power. In 1831, the Nguy\u1ec5n emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng renamed it H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (\u6cb3\u5167, \"Between Rivers\" or \"River Interior\"). Hanoi was occupied by the French in 1873 and passed to them ten years later. As Hano\u00ef, it was located in the protectorate of Tonkin became the capital of French Indochina after 1887.\n\n\n=== During two wars ===\nThe city was occupied by the Imperial Japanese in 1940 and liberated in 1945, when it briefly became the seat of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh government after Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam. However, the French returned and reoccupied the city in 1946. After nine years of fighting between the French and Viet Minh forces, Hanoi became the capital of an independent North Vietnam in 1954.\nDuring the Vietnam War, Hanoi's transportation facilities were disrupted by the bombing of bridges and railways. These were all, however, promptly repaired. Following the end of the war, Hanoi became the capital of a reunified Vietnam when North and South Vietnam were reunited on 2 July 1976.\n\n\n=== Modern Hanoi ===\nAfter the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi economic policies were approved in 1986, the Communist Party and national and municipal governments hoped to attract international investments for urban development projects in Hanoi. The high-rise commercial buildings did not begin to appear until ten years later due to the international investment community being skeptical of the security of their investments in Vietnam. Rapid urban development and rising costs displaced many residential areas in central Hanoi. Following a short period of economic stagnation after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Hanoi resumed its rapid economic growth.On 29 May 2008, it was decided that H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac Province's M\u00ea Linh District and 4 communes of L\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n District, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Province be merged into the metropolitan area of Hanoi from 1 August 2008. Hanoi's total area then increased to 334,470 hectares in 29 subdivisions with the new population being 6,232,940., effectively tripling its size. The Hanoi Capital Region (V\u00f9ng Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), a metropolitan area covering Hanoi and 6 surrounding provinces under its administration, will have an area of 13,436 square kilometres (5,188 sq mi) with 15 million people by 2020.\nHanoi has experienced a rapid construction boom recently. Skyscrapers, popping up in new urban areas, have dramatically changed the cityscape and have formed a modern skyline outside the old city. In 2015, Hanoi is ranked 39th by Emporis in the list of world cities with most skyscrapers over 100 m; its two tallest buildings are Hanoi Landmark 72 Tower (336 m, second tallest in Vietnam after Ho Chi Minh City's Landmark 81 and third tallest in south-east Asia after Malaysia's Petronas Towers) and Hanoi Lotte Center (272 m, also, third tallest in Vietnam).\nPublic outcry in opposition to the redevelopment of culturally significant areas in Hanoi persuaded the national government to implement a low-rise policy surrounding Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake. The Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District is also protected from commercial redevelopment.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location, topography ===\nHanoi is located in northern region of Vietnam, situated in the Vietnam's Red River delta, nearly 90 km (56 mi) away from the coastal area. Hanoi contains three basic kinds of terrain, which are the delta area, the midland area and mountainous zone. In general, the terrain is gradually lower from the north to the south and from the west to the east, with the average height ranging from 5 to 20 meters above the sea level. The hills and mountainous zones are located in the northern and western part of the city. The highest peak is at Ba Vi with 1281 m, located west of the city proper.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHanoi features a warm humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) with plentiful precipitation. The city experiences the typical climate of northern Vietnam, with four distinct seasons. Summer, from May to August, is characterized by hot and humid weather with abundant rainfall. From September to November comprise the fall season, characterized by a decrease in temperature and precipitation. Winter, from December to January, is dry and cool by national standards. The city is usually cloudy and foggy in winter, averaging only 1.5 hours of sunshine per day in February and March.\nHanoi averages 1,612 millimetres (63.5 in) of rainfall per year, the majority falling from May to October. There are an average of 114 days with rain.The average annual temperature is 23.6 \u00b0C (74 \u00b0F), with a mean relative humidity of 79%. The highest recorded temperature was 42.8 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) in May 1926, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2.7 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) in January 1955.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nH\u00e0 N\u1ed9i is divided into 12 urban districts, 1 district-leveled town and 17 rural districts. When H\u00e0 T\u00e2y was merged into Hanoi in 2008, H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng was transformed into an urban district while S\u01a1n T\u00e2y degraded to a district-leveled town. They are further subdivided into 22 commune-level towns (or townlets), 399 communes, and 145 wards.\n\n\n=== List of local government divisions ===\nHT \u2013 formerly an administrative subdivision unit of the defunct H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHanoi's population is constantly growing (about 3.5% per year), a reflection of the fact that the city is both a major metropolitan area of Northern Vietnam, and also the country's political centre. This population growth also puts a lot of pressure on the infrastructure, some of which is antiquated and dates back to the early 20th century.\nThe number of Hanoians who have settled down for more than three generations is likely to be very small when compared to the overall population of the city. Even in the Old Quarter, where commerce started hundreds of years ago and consisted mostly of family businesses, many of the street-front stores nowadays are owned by merchants and retailers from other provinces. The original owner family may have either rented out the store and moved into the adjoining house or moved out of the neighbourhood altogether. The pace of change has especially escalated after the abandonment of central-planning economic policies and relaxing of the district-based household registrar system.Hanoi's telephone numbers have been increased to 8 digits to cope with demand (October 2008). Subscribers' telephone numbers have been changed in a haphazard way; however, mobile phones and SIM cards are readily available in Vietnam, with pre-paid mobile phone credit available in all areas of Hanoi.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nBuddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism have been the main religions of Vietnam for many years. Most Vietnamese consider themselves Buddhist, though not all of them regularly follow religion. [19] According to figures from the Vietnam General Statistics Office in 2009, 6.8 million (or 7.9% of the total population) are Buddhists, 5.7 million (6.6%) are Catholics, 1.4 million (1.7%) followed by Joao Hao, 0.8 million (0.9%) are practicing Cao Dai and 0.7 million (0.9%) are Protestants. In total, 15,651,467 Vietnamese (18.2%) are declared to belong to one religion. [20] The remaining 81% are atheists.\nThe Vietnamese constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but in 2004 and 2005, the State Department included Vietnam in countries where freedom of worship was violated, as the Vietnamese government imposed religious restrictions on religious, religious and religious groups. practicing religions. By 2007, because of new resolutions, the faithful could practice their religion more freely, while new religious groups emerged. However, it appears that the authorities were delaying the issuance of licenses to Protestant churches in the northern part of the country and the training of Catholic and Protestant pastors.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHanoi has the highest Human Development Index among the cities in Vietnam. According to a recent ranking by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Hanoi will be the fastest growing city in the world in terms of GDP growth from 2008 to 2025. In the year 2013, Hanoi contributed 12.6% to GDP, exported 7.5% of total exports, contributed 17% to the national budget and attracted 22% investment capital of Vietnam. The city's nominal GDP at current prices reached 451,213 billion VND (21.48 billion USD) in 2013, which made per capita GDP stand at 63.3 million VND (3,000 USD).\nIndustrial production in the city has experienced a rapid boom since the 1990s, with average annual growth of 19.1 percent from 1991\u201395, 15.9 percent from 1996\u20132000, and 20.9 percent during 2001\u20132003. In addition to eight existing industrial parks, Hanoi is building five new large-scale industrial parks and 16 small- and medium-sized industrial clusters. The non-state economic sector is expanding fast, with more than 48,000 businesses operating under the Enterprise Law (as of 3/2007).\n\nTrade is another strong sector of the city. In 2003, Hanoi had 2,000 businesses engaged in foreign trade, having established ties with 161 countries and territories. The city's export value grew by an average 11.6 percent each year from 1996\u20132000 and 9.1 percent during 2001\u20132003. The economic structure also underwent important shifts, with tourism, finance, and banking now playing an increasingly important role. Hanoi's traditional business districts are Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm, Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng and \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a; and newly developing C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y, Nam T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, B\u1eafc T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, Thanh Xu\u00e2n and H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng in the west.\nSimilar to Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi enjoys a rapidly developing real estate market. The most notable new urban areas are central Trung H\u00f2a Nh\u00e2n Ch\u00ednh, M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh, the luxurious zones of The Manor, Ciputra, Royal City in the Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i Street (Thanh Xu\u00e2n District) and Times City in the Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District.\nAgriculture, previously a pillar in Hanoi's economy, has striven to reform itself, introducing new high-yield plant varieties and livestock, and applying modern farming techniques.After the economic reforms that initiated economic growth, Hanoi's appearance has also changed significantly, especially in recent years. Infrastructure is constantly being upgraded, with new roads and an improved public transportation system. Hanoi has allowed many fast-food chains into the city, such as Jollibee, Lotteria, Pizza Hut, KFC, and others. Locals in Hanoi perceive the ability to purchase \"fast-food\" as an indication of luxury and permanent fixtures. Similarly, city officials are motivated by food safety concerns and their aspirations for a \"modern\" city to replace the 67 traditional food markets with 1,000 supermarkets by 2025. This is likely to increase consumption of less nutritious foods, as traditional markets are key for consumption of fresh rather than processed foods.Over three-quarters of the jobs in Hanoi are state-owned. 9% of jobs are provided by collectively owned organizations. 13.3% of jobs are in the private sector. The structure of employment has been changing rapidly as state-owned institutions downsize and private enterprises grow. Hanoi has in-migration controls which allow the city to accept only people who add skills Hanoi's economy. A 2006 census found that 5,600 rural produce vendors exist in Hanoi, with 90% of them coming from surrounding rural areas. These numbers indicate the much greater earning potential in urban rather than in rural spaces. The uneducated, rural, and mostly female street vendors are depicted as participants of \"microbusiness\" and local grassroots economic development by business reports. In July 2008, Hanoi's city government devised a policy to partially ban street vendors and side-walk based commerce on 62 streets due to concerns about public health and \"modernizing\" the city's image to attract foreigners. Many foreigners believe that the vendors add a traditional and nostalgic aura to the city, although street vending was much less common prior to the 1986 \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi policies. The vendors have not able to form effective resistance tactics to the ban and remain embedded in the dominant capitalist framework of modern Hanoi.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Infrastructural development ===\nA development master plan for Hanoi was designed by Ernest Hebrard in 1924, but was only partially implemented. The close relationship between the Soviet Union and Vietnam led to the creation of the first comprehensive plan for Hanoi with the assistance of Soviet planners between 1981 and 1984. It was never realized because it appeared to be incompatible with Hanoi's existing layout.In recent years, two master plans have been created to guide Hanoi's development. The first was the Hanoi Master Plan 1990-2010, approved in April 1992. It was created out of collaboration between planners from Hanoi and the National Institute of Urban and Rural Planning in the Ministry of Construction. The plan's three main objectives were to create housing and a new commercial center in an area known as Ngh\u0129a \u0110\u00f4, expand residential and industrial areas in the Gia L\u00e2m District, and develop the three southern corridors linking Hanoi to H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng and the Thanh Tr\u00ec District. The end result of the land-use pattern was meant to resemble a five cornered star by 2010. In 1998, a revised version of the Hanoi Master plan was approved to be completed in 2020. It addressed the significant increase of population projections within Hanoi. Population densities and high rise buildings in the inner city were planned to be limited to protect the old parts of inner Hanoi. A rail transport system is planned to be built to expand public transport and link the Hanoi to surrounding areas. Projects such as airport upgrading, a golf course, and cultural villages have been approved for development by the government.Hanoi is still faced with the problems associated with increasing urbanization. The disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor is a problem in both the capital and throughout the country. Hanoi's public infrastructure is in poor condition. The city has frequent power cuts, air and water pollution, poor road conditions, traffic congestion, and a rudimentary public transit system. Traffic congestion and air pollution are worsening as the number of motor cycles increases. Squatter settlements are expanding on the outer rim of the city as homelessness rises.In the late 1980s, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Vietnamese government designed a project to develop rural infrastructure. The project focused on improving roads, water supply and sanitation, and educational, health and social facilities because economic development in the communes and rural areas surrounding Hanoi is dependent on the infrastructural links between the rural and urban areas, especially for the sale of rural products. The project aimed to use locally available resources and knowledge such as compressed earth construction techniques for building. It was jointly funded by the UNDP, the Vietnamese government, and resources raised by the local communities and governments. In four communes, the local communities contributed 37% of the total budget. Local labor, community support, and joint funding were decided as necessary for the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\n\n=== Civil society development ===\nPart of the goals of the \u0111\u1ed5i m\u1edbi economic reforms was to decentralize governance for purpose of economic improvement. This led to the establishment of the first issue-oriented civic organizations in Hanoi. In the 1990s, Hanoi experienced significant poverty alleviation as a result of both the market reforms and civil society movements. Most of the civic organizations in Hanoi were established after 1995, at a rate much slower than in Ho Chi Minh City. Organizations in Hanoi are more \"tradition-bound,\" focused on policy, education, research, professional interests, and appealing to governmental organizations to solve social problems. This marked difference from Ho Chi Minh's civic organizations, which practice more direct intervention to tackle social issues, may be attributed to the different societal identities of North and South Vietnam. Hanoi-based civic organizations use more systematic development and less of a direct intervention approach to deal with issues of rural development, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection. They rely more heavily on full-time staff than volunteers. In Hanoi, 16.7% of civic organizations accept anyone as a registered member and 73.9% claim to have their own budgets, as opposed to 90.9% in Ho Chi Minh City. A majority of the civic organizations in Hanoi find it difficult to work with governmental organizations. Many of the strained relations between non-governmental and governmental organizations results from statism, a bias against non-state organizations on the part of government entities.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nAs the capital of Vietnam for almost a thousand years, Hanoi is considered one of the main cultural centres of Vietnam, where most Vietnamese dynasties have left their imprint. Even though some relics have not survived through wars and time, the city still has many interesting cultural and historic monuments for visitors and residents alike. Even when the nation's capital moved to Hu\u1ebf under the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty in 1802, the city of Hanoi continued to flourish, especially after the French took control in 1888 and modeled the city's architecture to their tastes, lending an important aesthetic to the city's rich stylistic heritage. The city hosts more cultural sites than any other city in Vietnam, and boasts more than 1,000 years of history; that of the past few hundred years has been well preserved.\n\n\n=== Old Quarter ===\n\nThe Old Quarter, near Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, maintains most of the original street layout and some of the architecture of old Hanoi. At the beginning of the 20th century Hanoi consisted of the \"36 streets\", the citadel, and some of the newer French buildings south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake, most of which are now part of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district. Each street had merchants and households specializing in a particular trade, such as silk, jewelry or even bamboo. The street names still reflect these specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original commerce. The area is famous for its specializations in trades such as traditional medicine and local handicrafts, including silk shops, bamboo carpenters, and tin smiths. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars can be found here also. A night market (near \u0110\u1ed3ng Xu\u00e2n Market) in the heart of the district opens for business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing, souvenirs and food.\n\n\n=== Imperial sites ===\n\nImperior sites are mostly in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and a bit of \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a District. They are juxtaposed with French colonial architecture (villas, administrative buildings and tree-lined boulevards). Some prominent edifices from feudal time include the Temple of Literature (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu), site of the oldest university in Vietnam which was started in 1010, the One Pillar Pagoda (Ch\u00f9a M\u1ed9t C\u1ed9t) which was built based on the dream of king L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng (1028-1054) in 1049, and the Flag Tower of Hanoi (C\u1ed9t c\u1edd H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i). In 2004, a massive part of the 900-year-old Hanoi Citadel was discovered in central Hanoi, near the site of Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square.\n\n\n=== Lakes ===\nA city between rivers built on lowlands, Hanoi has many scenic lakes and is sometimes called the \"city of lakes.\" Among its lakes, the most famous are Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, West Lake, Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake and B\u1ea3y M\u1eabu Lake (inside Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Park). Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, also known as Sword Lake, is the historical and cultural center of Hanoi, and is linked to the legend of the magic sword. West Lake (H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y) is a popular place for people to spend time. It is the largest lake in Hanoi, with many temples in the area. The lakeside road in the Nghi Tam \u2013 Quang Ba area is perfect for bicycling, jogging and viewing the cityscape or enjoying the lotus ponds in the summer. The best way to see the majestic beauty of a West Lake sunset is to view it from one of the many bars around the lake, especially from The Summit at Pan Pacific Hanoi (formally known as Summit Lounge at Sofitel Plaza Hanoi).\n\n\n=== Colonial Hanoi ===\n\nHanoi was the capital and the administrative center for French Indochina for most of the colonial period (from 1902 to 1945). The French Colonial architecture style became dominant, and many examples remain today: tree-lined boulevards (such as Phan Dinh Phung street, Hoang Dieu street and Tran Phu street) and many villas, mansions, and government buildings. Many of the colonial structures are an eclectic mixture of French and traditional Vietnamese architectural styles, such as the National Museum of Vietnamese History, the Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts and the old Indochina Medical College. Gouveneur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul Doumer (1898-1902) played a crucial role in colonial Hanoi's urban planning. Under his tenure there was a major construction boom.French Colonial buildings in Hanoi are mostly in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and the south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District, the two French Quarters of the city. Notable landmarks include:\nIn Ba \u0110\u00ecnh district:\n\nPresidential Palace\nC\u1eeda B\u1eafc Church\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs building\nSeveral ministries, government agencies and foreign embassiesIn Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district:\n\nGrand Opera House\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral\nLong Bi\u00ean Bridge\nGrand Palais\nFrench School of the Far East\nHotel Metropole\nTonkin Palace (State Guest House)\nH\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison\nSupreme Court building\nIndochina Medical College\nMuseum of Revolution\nCentral Station\nState Bank of Vietnam\nSeveral foreign embassies\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nHanoi is home to a number of museums:\n\nNational Museum of Vietnamese History\nVietnam National Museum of Fine Arts\nVietnam Museum of Ethnology\nVietnam Museum of Revolution\nH\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison\nHo Chi Minh Museum\nHanoi Contemporary Arts Centre\nVietnam Military History Museum\nHanoi Museum\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\n\nHanoi's western suburbs, previously H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, offers a number of important religious sites\n\nThe Th\u1ea7y Pagoda in Qu\u1ed1c Oai District was established in the 11th century and dedicated to Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n master T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh (Chinese: \u5f90\u9053\u884c, 1072-1116). It is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Vietnam.\nThe Perfume Pagoda is a vast complex of Buddhist temples and shrines built into the limestone Huong Tich mountains. It has a long pilgrimage route along the Yen river.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nAccording to Mastercard\u2019s 2019 report, Hanoi is Vietnam's most visited city (15th in Asia Pacific), with 4.8 million overnight international visitors in 2018. Hanoi is sometimes dubbed the \"Paris of the East\" for its French influences. With its tree-fringed boulevards, more than two dozen lakes and thousands of French colonial-era buildings, Hanoi is a popular tourist destination.\nThe tourist destinations in Hanoi are generally grouped into two main areas: the Old Quarter and the French Quarter(s). The \"Old Quarter\" is in the northern half of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District with small street blocks and alleys, and a traditional Vietnamese atmosphere. Many streets in the Old Quarter have names signifying the goods (\"h\u00e0ng\") the local merchants were or are specialized in. For example, \"H\u00e0ng B\u1ea1c\" (silver stores) still have many stores specializing in trading silver and jewelries.\nTwo areas are generally called the \"French Quarters\": the governmental area in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and the south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District. Both areas have distinctive French Colonial style villas and broad tree-lined avenues. \nThe political center of Vietnam, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh has a high concentration of Vietnamese government headquarters, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly and several ministries and embassies, most of which used administrative buildings of colonial French Indochina. The One Pillar Pagoda, the Lyc\u00e9e du Protectorat and the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum are also in Ba Dinh. \nSouth of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm's \"French Quarter\" has several French-Colonial landmarks, including the Hanoi Opera House, the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel, the National Museum of Vietnamese History (formerly the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient), and the St. Joseph's Cathedral. Most of the French-Colonial buildings in Hoan Kiem are now used as foreign embassies.\nSince 2014, Hanoi has consistently been voted in the world's top ten destinations by TripAdvisor. It ranked 8th in 2014, 4th in 2015 and 8th in 2016.\nHanoi is the most affordable international destination in TripAdvisor's annual TripIndex report. In 2017, Hanoi will welcome more than 5 million international tourists.\n\n\n== Entertainment ==\n\nA variety of options for entertainment in Hanoi can be found throughout the city. Modern and traditional theaters, cinemas, karaoke bars, dance clubs, bowling alleys, and an abundance of opportunities for shopping provide leisure activity for both locals and tourists. Hanoi has been named one of the top 10 cities for shopping in Asia by Water Puppet Tours. The number of art galleries exhibiting Vietnamese art has dramatically increased in recent years, now including galleries such as \"Nhat Huy\" of Huynh Thong Nhat.\nNh\u00e0 Tri\u1ec3n L\u00e3m at 29 Hang Bai street hosts regular photo, sculpture, and paint exhibitions in conjuncture with local artists and travelling international expositions.\nA popular traditional form of entertainment is Water puppetry, which is shown, for example, at the Th\u0103ng Long Water Puppet Theatre.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nTo adapt to Hanoi's rapid economic growth and high population density, many modern shopping centers and megamalls have been opened in Hanoi.\nMajor malls are:\n\nTrang Tien Plaza, High-end Mall on Trang Tien street (right next to Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake), Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District\nVincom Center, a modern mall with hi-end CGV cineplex, Ba Trieu Street (just 2 km from Hoan Kiem lake), Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District\nThe Garden Shopping Center, Me Tri \u2013 M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh, Nam T\u1eeb Li\u00eam District\nIndochina Plaza, Xuan Thuy street, C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y District\nVincom Royal City Megamall, the largest underground mall in Asia with 230,000 square metres of shops, restaurants, cineplex, waterpark (formerly), cinema, ice skating rink; Nguyen Trai street (approx 6 km from Hoan Kiem Lake), Thanh Xu\u00e2n District\nVincom Times City Megamall, another megamall of 230,000 square metres including shops, restaurants, cineplex, huge musical fountain on central square and a giant aquarium; Minh Khai street (approx 5 km from Hoan Kiem Lake), Hai Ba Trung district\nLotte Department Store, opened September 2014, Lieu Giai Street, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District\nAeon Mall Long Bien opened last October 2015, Long Bien District\nAeon Mall Ha Dong opened in the end of 2019, Ha Dong district\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nHanoi has rich culinary traditions. Many of Vietnam's most famous dishes, such as ph\u1edf, ch\u1ea3 c\u00e1, b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n and c\u1ed1m are believed to have originated in Hanoi. Perhaps most widely known is Ph\u1edf\u2014a simple rice noodle soup often eaten as breakfast at home or at street-side cafes, but also served in restaurants as a meal. Two varieties dominate the Hanoi scene: Ph\u1edf B\u00f2, containing beef and Ph\u1edf G\u00e0, containing chicken. B\u00fan ch\u1ea3, a dish consisting of charcoal roasted pork served in a sweet/salty soup with rice noodle vermicelli and lettuce, is by far the most popular food item among locals. President Obama famously tried this dish at a Le Van Huu eatery with Anthony Bourdain in 2016, prompting the opening of a B\u00fan ch\u1ea3 restaurant bearing his name in the Old Quarter.\nVietnam's national dish ph\u1edf has been named as one of the Top 5 street foods in the world by globalpost.Hanoi has a number of restaurants whose menus specifically offer dishes containing snake and various species of insects. Insect-inspired menus can be found at a number of restaurants in Khuong Thuong village, Hanoi. The signature dishes at these restaurant are those containing processed ant-eggs, often in the culinary styles of Thai people or Vietnam's Muong and Tay ethnic people. Dog eating used to be popular in Hanoi in 1990s and early 2000s but is now dying out quickly due to strong objections.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nHanoi, as the capital of French Indochina, was home to the first Western-style universities in Indochina, including: Indochina Medical College (1902) \u2013 now Hanoi Medical University, Indochina University (1904) \u2013 now Hanoi National University (the largest), and \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine (1925) \u2013 now Hanoi University of Fine Art.\nAfter the Communist Party of Vietnam took control of Hanoi in 1954, many new universities were built, among them, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, still the largest technical university in Vietnam. Recently ULIS (University of Languages and International Studies) was rated as one of the top universities in south-east Asia for languages and language studies at the undergraduate level.  Other universities that are not part of Vietnam National University or Hanoi University include Hanoi School for Public Health, Hanoi School of Agriculture, Electric Power University and University of Transport and Communications.\nHanoi is the largest center of education in Vietnam. It is estimated that 62% of the scientists in the whole country are living and working in Hanoi. Admissions to undergraduate study are through entrance examinations, which are conducted annually and open to everyone (who has successfully completed his/her secondary education) in the country. The majority of universities in Hanoi are public, although in recent years a number of private universities have begun operation. Th\u0103ng Long University, founded in 1988, by Vietnamese mathematics professors in Hanoi and France was the first private university in Vietnam. Because many of Vietnam's major universities are located in Hanoi, students from other provinces (especially in the northern part of the country) wishing to enter university often travel to Hanoi for the annual entrance examination. Such events usually take place in June and July, during which a large number of students and their families converge on the city for several weeks around the intense examination period. In recent years, these entrance exams have been centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Education, but entrance requirements are decided independently by each university.\nAlthough there are state owned kindergartens, there are also many private ventures that serve both local and international needs. Pre-tertiary (elementary and secondary) schools in Hanoi are generally state run, but there are also some independent schools. Education is equivalent to the K\u201312 system in the U.S., with elementary school between grades 1 and 5, middle school (or junior high) between grades 6 and 9, and high school from grades 10 to 12. There are several specialised school (or high school for the gifted) in Hanoi where excellent students in Hanoi attend. Some schools include:\n\u2022 Hanoi - Amsterdam High School\n\u2022 Chu Van An High School\n\u2022 Foreign Language Specialized School\n\u2022 Nguyen Hue High School\n\u2022 High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi National University of Education\n\u2022 High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science\nEducation levels are much higher within the city of Hanoi in comparison to the suburban areas outside the city. About 33.8% of the labor force in the city has completed secondary school in contrast to 19.4% in the suburbs. 21% of the labor force in the city has completed tertiary education in contrast to 4.1% in the suburbs.International schools include:\n\nBritish International School Hanoi\nBritish Vietnamese International School Hanoi\nHanoi International School\nJapanese School of Hanoi\nKorean International School in Hanoi\nLyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais Alexandre Yersin\nUnited Nations International School of Hanoi\nVietnam-Australia School, HanoiFormer schools:\n\nLyc\u00e9e Albert Sarraut\n\n\n=== Reform ===\nCountry-wide educational change is difficult in Vietnam, due to the restrictive control of the government on social and economic development strategies. According to Hanoi government publications, the national system of education was reformed in 1950, 1956 and 1970. It was not until 1975 when the two separate education systems of the former North and South Vietnam territories became unified under a single national system. In Hanoi in December 1996, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam stated that: \"To carry out industrialization and modernization successfully, it is necessary to develop education and training strongly [and to] maximize human resources, the key factor of fast and sustained development.\"\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nHanoi is served by Noi Bai International Airport, located in the Soc Son District, approximately 15 km (9 mi) north of Hanoi. The new international terminal (T2), designed and built by Japanese contractors, opened in January 2015 and is a big facelift for Noibai International Airport. In addition, a new highway and the new Nhat Tan cable-stay bridge connecting the airport and the city center opened at the same time, offering much more convenience than the old road (via Thanglong bridge). Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre.\nHanoi is also the origin or departure point for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City from Hanoi station (formerly Hang Co station), with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Trains also depart Hanoi frequently for Hai Phong and other northern cities. The Reunification Express line was established during French colonial rule and was completed over a period of nearly forty years, from 1899 to 1936. The Reunification Express between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City covers a distance of 1,726 km (1,072 mi) and takes approximately 33 hours. As of 2005, there were 278 stations on the Vietnamese railway network, of which 191 were located along the North-South line.\nThe main means of transport within Hanoi city are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and a rising number of cars. In recent decades, motorbikes have overtaken bicycles as the main form of transportation. Cars however are probably the most notable change in the past five years as many Vietnamese people purchase the vehicles for the first time.  The increased number of cars are the main cause gridlock as roads and infrastructure in the older parts of Hanoi were not designed to accommodate them. On 4 July 2017, the Hanoi government voted to ban motorbikes entirely by 2030, in order to reduce pollution, congestion, and encourage the expansion and use of public transport.There are two metro lines under construction in Hanoi now, as part of the master plan for the future Hanoi Metro system. Line 2A has no opening date after failure to meet the deadline at the end of 2019, while Line 3 is expected to begin operation in 2022.\nPersons on their own or traveling in a pair who wish to make a fast trip around Hanoi to avoid traffic jams or to travel at an irregular time or by way of an irregular route often use \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug bike\"). Motorbikes can also be rented from agents within the Old Quarter of Hanoi, although this falls inside a rather grey legal area.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThere are several gymnasiums and stadiums throughout the city of Hanoi. The biggest ones are M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium (L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd Boulevard), Quan Ngua Sporting Palace (V\u0103n Cao Avenue), Hanoi Aquatics Sports Complex and Hanoi Indoor Games Gymnasium. The others include H\u00e0ng \u0110\u1eaby Stadium. The third Asian Indoor Games were held in Hanoi in 2009. The others are Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng Gymnasium, Tr\u1ecbnh Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c Gymnasium, V\u1ea1n B\u1ea3o Sports Complex.\nOn 6 November 2018, it was announced that in 2020, Hanoi would become the host of the first FIA Formula 1 Vietnamese Grand Prix on a street circuit on the outskirts of the city.Hanoi has two basketball teams that compete in the Vietnam Basketball Association (VBA), the Hanoi Buffaloes and Thang Long Warriors. H\u00e0ng \u0110\u1eaby Stadium is home for two football clubs, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i FC and Viettel FC, both participating in V.League 1\n\n\n== Health care and other facilities ==\nSome medical facilities in Hanoi:\n\nB\u1ea1ch Mai Hospital\nViet Duc Hospital\nSaint Paul General Hospital\n108 Military Central Hospital\nH\u00f4pital Fran\u00e7ais de Hanoi\nInternational SOS\nHanoi Medical University Hospital\nThanh Nhan Hospital\nVinmec International Hospital\nThu Cuc General Hospital\nK Hospital\nMedlatech Hospital\n\n\n== City for Peace ==\nOn 16 July 1999, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) presented the title \"City for Peace\" to Hanoi because the city met the following criteria: Exemplary action against exclusion and in support of the dialogue between communities; Exemplary urban action; Exemplary environmental action; Exemplary action to promote culture; Exemplary action in the field of education and especially civic education.Hanoi is the only city in Asia-Pacific that was granted this title.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nHanoi is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nHanoi is twinned with:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGioi Market\n\u0110\u1ed3ng Xu\u00e2n Market\nHo Chi Minh City\nNorth\u2013South Railway (Vietnam)\nList of historical capitals of Vietnam\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nBoudarel, Georges (2002).

        "wiki": "The X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda (Vietnamese: Ch\u00f9a X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i; ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: \u820d\u5229\u5bfa) is the largest pagoda in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City, Vietnam. It was built in 1956 and was the headquarters of Buddhism in South Vietnam. The pagoda is located in District 3, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City and lies on a plot of 2500 square metres. The name X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i is the Vietnamese translation for \u015bar\u012bra, a term used for relics of Buddhists.\nThe pagoda is best known for the raids, in which the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces loyal to Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, the brother of the Roman Catholic President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, raided and vandalised Buddhist monasteries and pagodas on 21 August 1963.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nConstruction began on 5 August 1956, according to the plans drawn up by the architects Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng and \u0110\u1ed7 B\u00e1 Vinh, while the directing engineers were D\u01b0 Ng\u1ecdc \u00c1nh and H\u1ed3 T\u1ed1 Thu\u1eadn. The pagoda was opened on 2 May 1958, by the Most Venerable Thich Khanh Anh. The pagoda was built to enshrine a sample of the relics of Gautama Buddha, giving its name.\n\n\n=== Protests and raids in 1963 ===\n\nA series of raids in response to Vietnamese Buddhists' protests for civil rights in the face of religious persecution from the government of the Roman Catholic President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m. Squads of Special Forces, led by L\u00ea Quang Tung and combat police flattened the gates and smashed their way into the pagoda at around 00:20 on 21 August 1963, as X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i's brass gong was clanged as a warning signal of the attack. Nhu's men were armed with pistols, submachine guns, carbines, shotguns, grenades and tear gas. The Special Forces were joined by truckloads of combat police in army camouflage uniforms. Monks and nuns who barricaded themselves behind wooden shields were attacked with rifle butts and bayonets. The gong of the pagoda was drowned out by the burst of automatic weapons fire, the sound of exploding grenades, shattering glass and human screaming. One monk was thrown from the balcony down to the courtyard six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and managed to confiscate the intact charred heart of Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c, the monk who had self-immolated in protest against the policies of the regime. Two monks jumped the back wall of the pagoda into the grounds of the adjoining US Aid Mission, where they were granted asylum.Thich Tinh Khiet, the 80-year-old Buddhist patriarch of Vietnam, was seized and taken to a military hospital on the outskirts of Saigon. The commander of the III Corps of the ARVN, General T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh, soon announced military control over Saigon, canceling all commercial flights into the city and instituting press censorship. Across the country, hundreds were estimated to have died or vanished, and more than one thousand monks were incarcerated.\n\n\n=== Administrative function ===\nThe pagoda served as the headquarters of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association until 1981, and as its second office until May 1993.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\nThe site includes a number of buildings, including the main ceremonial hall and the bell tower. The pagoda is separated from the street by a gated fence. Inside the fence is a popular Chinese-style statue of Quan \u00c2m holding a vial of elixir in one hand and making the gesture of removing obstacles with the other. The main hall of the pagoda is located on the upper level. Men ascend by the stairs on the left hand side, women by those on the right. The hall is rectangular in shape, and is supported by pillars. Facing the entrance is the shrine, which is dominated by a large statue of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n=== Shrine ===\n\nThe statue of Gautama depicts the Buddha seated in meditation on a lotus blossom. He is wearing the garb of a monk. As usual, he is depicted with ears lengthened by the use of jewelry (indicating his royal origins), closely cropped curly hair (indicating renunciation of the worldly life), and a large protuberance on his head (indicating aptitude). Behind his head is a sun disc. This statue was crafted by sculptors from Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a, a city just north of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City. It has been in its current state since 1969, when a gold coating was applied to it. In front of the statue of Gautama Buddha is the shrine dedicated to the relics of the Buddha, with the relics being held in a small stupa. Towards the front of the shrine is a small porcelain image of the \"Laughing Buddha\" Maitreya, the Buddha of the future. Between the small statue of Maitreya and the large statue of Gautama is a golden image of multi-armed Cundi (Chuan De) bodhisattva sitting in meditation on a lotus blossom. The bodhisattva's many hands grasp familiar attributes such as the sword, the wheel, and the trident. Elegant Chinese-style vases on either side of the shrine hold flowers of various colors.\n\n\n=== Scenes from the life of Gautama Buddha ===\nThe walls of the main hall play host to a sequence of large panels depicting fourteen scenes from the life of the Gautama Buddha, from his birth as Prince Siddhartha to his attainment of nirvana. The images were created by Dr. Nguyen Van Long of the Gia Dinh Art School. Arranged sequentially high on the two side walls, the images are reminiscent of the depictions of the life of Jesus or of the Stations of the Cross found in some Christian churches. The fourteen scenes are as follows:\n\nQueen Maya, the mother of the historical Buddha, dreams that an elephant with six tusks enters her through her right side.\nThe young Siddhartha walks on open lotus flowers, pointing at the Heaven and the Earth.\nThe elder Asita notes the auspicious marks on the body of the infant Siddhartha that indicate he will be a great secular or religious leader.\nPrince Siddhartha sees an old man and a sick man, leading him to ponder the devastation to the human body caused by old age and disease.\nThe prince sees a corpse, and then a monk who is in perfect condition.\nHaving decided to renounce the secular life and to lead a life of religion, the prince looks for the last time upon his family as they lie sleeping.\nHaving left the royal city of Kapilavastu with his horse Kanthaka and horseman Channa, Siddhartha cuts off his long hair in order to symbolize his entry into the religious life.\nThree demon princesses representing ambition, anxiety, and voluptuousness try unsuccessfully to seduce the prince.\nMara the king of demons and his minions attempt unsuccessfully to intimidate the prince by violence.\nHaving attained Enlightenment, Gautama Buddha preaches the Four Noble Truths to his first four disciples in the garden.\nA young woman falsely accuses the Buddha of getting her pregnant, as the Buddha makes the gesture of calling upon the Earth as a witness; the Buddha instructs another young woman.\nElephants and other animals render hommage to Buddha; Buddha converts the venomous serpents.\nThe Buddha converts Angulimala, an armed assassin.\nLying on his side, the Buddha enters into nirvana.Above the entrance, facing the shrine itself, is an especially big image of Gautama Buddha seated in meditation underneath a fig tree.\n\n\n=== Bell tower ===\n\nThe bell tower of X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda was opened in 1961. The tower stands 32 m, has seven stories, and is the highest bell tower in Vietnam. On the highest level, there is a bell weighing two tonnes, which was cast in the model of the bell of Thi\u00ean M\u1ee5 Pagoda in Hu\u1ebf.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHammer, Ellen J.

        "wiki": "The Amazing Race 15 is the fifteenth installment of the American reality television show The Amazing Race. This season featured 12 teams of two, with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world, and was the last season to date to feature 12 teams of two, as subsequent seasons have featured 11 teams of two as normal.\nThe fifteenth cycle started on Sunday, September 27, 2009, with a two-hour premiere. It aired on CBS in the United States, and CTV) in Canada, on Sunday nights at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT with the season finale on December 6, 2009. The show was hosted by Phil Keoghan. In Asia, it was aired on AXN.\nDating couple Meghan Rickey and Cheyne Whitney were the winners of this Race.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and filming ===\n\nCBS aired the fifteenth season during the start of the 2009\u20132010 television season. CBS was the first broadcaster to announce that the show would be broadcast on Twitter, following Keoghan's own announcement of the show's renewal via Twitter.The fifteenth season spanned eight countries in 21 days. Teams traveled 25,000 miles (40,000 km) visiting Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as first time visits to Estonia and the Czech Republic.All route markers and clue boxes in Vietnam were colored yellow with a center white stripe rather than the typical yellow with a red stripe to avoid confusion with the flag of the former independent state of South Vietnam. This was also done previously in Season 10. These were also the original route markers in Season 1.\nThe Race introduced a new twist called a Switchback, where teams faced one of the series' challenges marked either memorable or infamous with minor changes. The Switchback that debuted on Leg 8 revisited the infamous Swedish Roadblock from Season 6, in which one team member had to unroll one of 270 hay bales with only 20 containing clues. Instead of being an exact duplicate, however, this Roadblock involved fewer bales (186) and instead of 20 clues, only seven Race flags were hidden. Additionally, the original version had the nine teams competing, but the time this Race reached the task, only five teams were involved. Also, the original version's task leg was an elimination leg, but the leg that featured the Switchback was a non-elimination leg.\nThis was the second season since Season 10 to feature a surprise elimination at a location other than a Pit Stop, which occurred at the Starting Line. The eliminated team at the Starting Line, Eric and Lisa Paskel, acknowledged in a post-show interview that they were the first team to leave the show voluntarily instead of spending the remainder of the Race at the Elimination Station, as they had previous plans to travel to India. As a consequence, they were not allowed to have any further involvement in the show. Although their travel was over by the time the Race ended, they were not told where the Finish Line was and as a result they were the second team to be absent at the Finish Line to cheer for the top three teams (the first was Toni & Dallas from Season 13), and had no knowledge of the outcome of the Race before the season finale aired.This season was the first since Season 11 to have more than two non-elimination points (Season 11 had four non-elimination points). This was also the first American season in which the first leg was a non-elimination leg. As such, all clues leading to the Pit Stops, including the first leg, ended with the sentence \"The last team to check in may be eliminated.\"\nWayne Newton appeared in the season finale. Teams were instructed to find him in a suite at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, where he then gave them the location of the Finish Line.\n\n\n=== Cast ===\n\nApplications were originally due by February 24, 2009, but the deadline was later extended. Semi-finalist interviews were held between March 20 and March 29, 2009. Following this, finalists were invited to Los Angeles between April 23 and April 30, 2009, for final interviews with the producers. From there, 12 teams were selected as contestants and to date, this is the final season, which featured the 12 teams of two concept. Filming took place around July and August 2009.\nCasting calls were also held as host Phil Keoghan cycled across the United States during the months of April and early May 2009 to support the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, during which Keoghan made stops to help with those casting calls.Some of the more prominent members of the cast are professional poker players Maria Ho and Tiffany Michelle, Miss America 2004 Ericka Dunlap, Harlem Globetrotters Herbert \"Flight Time\" Lang and Nathaniel \"Big Easy\" Lofton, and country singer-songwriter Canaan Smith. One member of the cast, Zev Glassenberg, has Asperger's Syndrome, and his teammate, Justin Kanew, is the son of Jeff Kanew, who directed Revenge of the Nerds.Meghan & Cheyne were married on May 7, 2011 with the teams of Sam & Dan, Maria & Tiffany, and Brian & Ericka were in the wedding party. Brian & Ericka recently decided to divorce prior to this event.\n\n\n==== Future appearances ====\nFriends Zev Glassenberg and Justin Kanew and Harlem Globetrotters Nate \"Big Easy\" Lofton and Herbert \"Flight Time\" Lang raced again in The Amazing Race 18 among a cast made up of returning teams from seasons 12-17. Flight Time & Big Easy were also chosen to compete in the second All-Stars edition.\nIn 2010, Flight Time & Big Easy each competed on Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? Tiffany later competed on Season 3 of Food Network's Worst Cooks in America and was eliminated in episode six. Brian later appeared on Season 7 of ABC's Shark Tank to secure funding for a potty training product called \"EZPeeZ\" but was unable to secure a deal. On May 25, 2016, Flight Time & Big Easy appeared on an Amazing Race-themed The Price is Right primetime special. In 2020, Brian hosted the HGTV show 100 Day Dream Home with his wife Mika.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe following teams participated in the Race, each listed along with their placements in each leg and relationships as identified by the program. Note that this table is not necessarily reflective of all content broadcast on television, owing to the inclusion or exclusion of some data. Placements are listed in finishing order:\n\nA red team placement indicates that the team was eliminated.\nA green \u0192 indicates that the team won a Fast Forward clue.\nAn underlined blue team's placement indicates that the team came in last on a non-elimination leg and had to perform a Speed Bump task in the following leg.\nA brown \u2283 means the team chose to use a U-Turn; \u2282 indicates the team who received it; \u2282\u2283 around a leg number indicates a leg where the U-Turn was available but not used.\n\n\n== Episode title quotes ==\nEpisode titles are often taken from quotes made by the racers. The first episode is a two-part episode that shows Legs 1 and 2 of the Race.\n\"They Thought Godzilla Was Walking Down the Street\" \u2013 Flight Time\n\"It's Like Being Dropped on Planet Mars\" \u2013 Lance\n\"Sean Penn Cambodia Here We Come\" \u2013 Justin\n\"I'm Like Ricky Bobby\" \u2013 Cheyne\n\"Do It for the Hood!

The exception was Eric & Lisa, who chose to leave the show upon their elimination. CBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the Pacific Time Zone to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa.\n\nLeg 1 was a non-elimination leg, hence no team was sent to the villa and no episode was shown. Eric & Lisa were the first team eliminated, at the Starting Line, but they did not go to the Elimination Station (see above).\nAfter Leg 2, Garrett & Jessica were the second team to be eliminated and were the first team sent to the villa. They both expressed their disappointment after having been in second place earlier in the leg and then being the first eliminated. Garrett believed that either Maria and Tiffany or Mika and Canaan would be the next team eliminated but both agreed that any of the teams could be eliminated next because of the animal challenges that faced them in the prior leg. Garrett noticed that Jessica was extremely bummed since being eliminated and he wanted to ask her to marry him at the Finish Line. Garrett proposed to Jessica at the beach and she said yes, after which her mood was significantly raised.\nAfter Leg 3, Marcy & Ron were the third team eliminated and were the second team sent to the villa. Ron told Garrett & Jessica that the intensity had gone up a notch between the remaining racers in the last leg. The eliminated teams did a Vietnamese Martial Arts Exercise, then went out to a luxurious restaurant called Vi\u1ec7t X\u01b0a. They had different views as to who would be the next team eliminated; Marcy believed that Flight Time & Big Easy would be eliminated next, Garrett, Jessica and Ron went with Meghan & Cheyne, Sam & Dan, and Mika & Canaan, respectively.\nAfter Leg 4, Zev & Justin were the fourth team eliminated but were not immediately sent to the villa due to Zev losing his passport. At the villa, Marcy and Ron asked Garrett and Jessica about the marriage proposal. Noting it had been two days since the next eliminated team was supposed to arrive, the two teams discussed what might have happened to the next eliminated team. Ron speculated that the team had either lost their passports or were seriously injured. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, Zev & Justin went to the U.S. Embassy to request a replacement passport for Zev, only to find it had been found in a temple near the Roadblock and was turned in. They grew even more disappointed when they figured out the passport likely fell out of the fanny pack when Justin opened it to retrieve a headlight while they were searching for the Roadblock in the wrong place. They later called the villa and informed the two teams there of their elimination because of the passport mishap and told them that they would join them as soon as they could.\nAfter Leg 5, Lance & Keri were the fifth team eliminated. The two teams at the villa were discussing Zev & Justin, speculating about their elimination. A van arrived at the villa and the teams went outside, fully expecting to see Zev & Justin. They were surprised to see that the van contained Lance & Keri; the third team to arrive at the villa. They explained to the other teams that their bad directional skills had led to their elimination, as well as the lodging conditions during the Cambodia Pit Stop. The three eliminated teams drove to a nearby river and started a race in a traditional Vietnamese boat between the boys (Garrett, Ron and Lance) and the girls (Jessica, Marcy and Keri).\nAfter Leg 6, Mika & Canaan were the sixth team to be eliminated. In the race teased in the previous episode, the eliminated girls managed to beat the boys in the boat race by nine seconds. Back at the villa, as the other three eliminated teams were relaxing, they noticed that Zev and Justin had showed up; the fourth team to arrive at the villa. The three eliminated teams were happy to see Zev & Justin who explained how they were eliminated and what they went through after this. The four eliminated teams went out to the night market where Zev sampled a chicken foot. Mika & Canaan were the fifth and last team to arrive at the villa. They explained to the other four eliminated teams of Mika's fear of water and heights that led to their elimination. Canaan noted they were at the water slide for around 45 minutes.\nAfter Leg 7, Maria & Tiffany were the seventh team to be eliminated. While the eliminated teams were playing cards, Maria & Tiffany called the villa to inform them of their elimination. They tried to explain to the other teams the true reason they were eliminated, but none of the other teams believed their story, as Maria & Tiffany had lied about their professions in the early stages of the Race. Maria & Tiffany told the teams they would see them at the End City. Several teams expressed their resentment of Maria & Tiffany as well as their satisfaction that they were eliminated from the Race and would not be joining them at the villa. The teams at the villa traveled to a rough-looking soccer field where they believed they would be playing against 7- to 9-year-old children from the area, but instead played against a teenage-looking group of soccer players.\nLeg 8 was a non-elimination leg, hence no new teams were sent to the villa. In the soccer match teased in the previous episode, the Vietnamese soccer players easily defeated the eliminated boys 4-0. The eliminated teams at the villa had a Shaman visit the villa and the teams had their futures told to them. Canaan decided to break up with Mika, saying the reason was not because of the Race, but because he was not ready for a relationship and hoped they would remain friends. In a post-show interview, however, they mentioned that they made up.\nAfter Leg 9, Gary & Matt were the eighth team eliminated. Prior to the call, the eliminated teams at the villa made predictions as to who would be eliminated next. All teams believed it was Brian and Ericka, except for Zev & Justin who believed it would be Gary & Matt who would be eliminated next. Gary & Matt then called the teams at the villa to inform them of their elimination. They told them about their Speed Bump that helped lead to their elimination, saying they were just minutes behind the last team. When asked who would win the Race, they believed any one of the teams could win.\nLeg 10 was a non-elimination leg, hence no new teams were sent to the villa. A taekwondo instructor was brought in to teach the eliminated teams how to spar. Lance, who was a blackbelt, took on the taekwondo master's student \u2013 ultimately cheating by wrestling him to the floor. They all then tried breaking tiles with their hands. All the eliminated teams had to pack up and fly to the End City. Jessica believed it was in Portland, Oregon, or maybe in Los Angeles, while Lance wished for it to be on the East Coast so he could easily return to Boston afterward.\nAfter Leg 11, Flight Time & Big Easy were the ninth and final team eliminated. Elimination Station showed five of the six eliminated teams arriving at the End City in Las Vegas, Nevada. After arriving there, the teams checked into a hotel. Once they checked in, they discussed with each other who would be eliminated next prior to a phone call from the ninth team. The teams at the hotel were shocked and disappointed to hear about Flight Time & Big Easy's elimination especially Zev & Justin who wanted them to win. They told them about what went wrong at the Roadblock. Flight Time & Big Easy said that they wanted to see Meghan & Cheyne to win it all and told them that they would see them at the Finish Line. Lance & Keri were happy to see the end of the Race and to know who they think is going to win. Garrett said that it's anybody's race. All the eliminated teams wanted to see Meghan and Cheyne to win, except for Garrett & Jessica who wanted to see Sam & Dan to come in 1st, Brian & Ericka in 2nd, and Meghan & Cheyne in 3rd.\nLeg 12 was the final leg of The Amazing Race 15. Maria & Tiffany, Gary & Matt, and Flight Time & Big Easy reunited with the other eliminated teams (except Eric & Lisa) at the Finish Line at Casa de Shenandoah. Most of the teams believed that they wanted to see Meghan & Cheyne win. Teams expressed their opinions about the final three teams at the Finish Line along with their joys and disappointments.\n\n\n== Race summary ==\n\n\n=== Leg 1 (United States \u2192 Japan) ===\n\nAirdate: September 27, 2009\n\nLos Angeles, California , United States  (Los Angeles River overlooking the Sixth Street Viaduct) (Starting Line and Elimination Point)\n Los Angeles (Los Angeles International Airport) to Tokyo, Japan  (Narita International Airport)\nTokyo (Minato \u2013 Tokyo Tower Studios) \nTokyo (Shibuya \u2013 Shibuya Scramble Crossing)\nTokyo (Shibuya \u2013 Konn\u014d Hachimang\u016b Shrine (in Japanese)) The first Roadblock of the Race required one team member to participate in a Japanese-style game show called Sushi Roulette. Once all the teams arrived at the Roadblock location, the host would spin a wheel with eleven plates of sushi, two of which were \"wasabi bombs\" \u2013 temaki-style sushi filled with hot wasabi. If the racer received a wasabi bomb, he or she had two minutes to eat it in order to receive the next clue. If they failed to finish it within the time allotted, they had to play again until they received a new wasabi bomb and could complete the task. Racers who received plain sushi had to eat the sushi and play until they received a wasabi bomb.\n\nAdditional tasksAt the Starting Line, teams had to search through over 1,000 license plates for one of eleven Japanese plates from Shinagawa and present it to Phil to receive tickets for one of two flights for their first destination: Tokyo, Japan. The kanji for Shinagawa (\u54c1\u5ddd) were provided in the clue, though not explicitly. The first six teams to find the correct license plate would receive plane tickets on an American Airlines flight that would leave thirty minutes before a United Airlines flight with the next five teams.

At panel, while Nguy\u1ec5n Tuy\u1ebft and L\u00ea Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng's photos amazed the judges, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Nghi, L\u00ea Th\u00fay, and D\u01b0\u01a1ng Dung's poor performances extremely disappointed them.

The versatility of face expression and body stretch were, hence, mainly considered during evaluation. L\u00ea Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng and L\u00ea Th\u00fay wowed the judges with their tremendously beautiful photos. L\u00ea Th\u00fay's photos were a lot more energized compared to her last week's photo; therefore, she was the first call-out. On the other hand, Thanh Th\u1ee7y and Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Nghi were being criticized again for not making any progress; Ho\u00e0ng Oanh's worse performance was also mentioned.

She said that even though her photo this week was not strong, her performances throughout the competition were much better than Th\u1ee7y's. She even tweeted on Facebook saying that the show has taken many things from her. That made judge \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1ea1nh C\u01b0\u1eddng lose his temptation and rebutted her on his own Facebook page that she would be forbidden to appear in any shows of his or any shows that he has been related with.\n\nFirst call-out: L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Th\u00fay\nBottom three: Tr\u1ea7n Thanh Th\u1ee7y, Phan Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Nghi, & Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Oanh\nEliminated: Phan Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Nghi & Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Oanh\n\n\n=== Episode 9 ===\nAir date: November 27, 2011Judge Nam Trung came to the house to teach the girls the basic of the make-up process.

Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh, and Th\u00f9y D\u01b0\u01a1ng struggled most. Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh and Th\u00f9y D\u01b0\u01a1ng found themselves in the bottom two, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh because she was criticized for her over-concentration and Th\u00f9y D\u01b0\u01a1ng for her inability to transfer herself into her characters.

In the end, Tr\u00e0 My was chosen as the challenge winner.

During the commercial, not many girls wowed the director beside Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y, Th\u00f9y Trang but they all still managed to finish their shoots.

L\u00ea Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng and Thanh Th\u1ee7y were eliminated for not being standing out like the others: Thanh Th\u1ee7y for her inability to live up to her full modeling potential, and L\u00ea Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng because the judges felt that even though she had a good personality, she tends not to make a progress.\nIt was also the first time in Vietnam's Next Top Model that all four judges burst into tears when they had to see the contestants leaving.

This exercise was told later that it will help the girls walk easily on any high heels. Since this was the first time doing it for all of the girls, they all struggled to balance and stand still. However, after practicing for a while, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh finally got it first which really upset Th\u00f9y Trang who was born and raised here. Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh also won the title for the fastest stilts-walker.\nThis week's elimination photoshoot was to do a high-fashion pose with elephants.

However, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh again got another chance which means Nguy\u1ec5n Tuy\u1ebft was eliminated.\n\nFirst call-out: Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tr\u00e0 My\nBottom two: Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh & Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft\nEliminated: Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft\nFeatured designer: \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1ea1nh C\u01b0\u1eddng\n\n\n=== Episode 12 ===\nAir date: December 25, 2011While the girls were about to go to their go-sees, Tuy\u1ebft Lan, the runner up of cycle 1 came by the house and surprised them.

Specifically, the most important thing a professional model always carries with her is her fashion portfolio where she has all of her best photos there.\nThe girls had to drive by themselves on a motorcycle to their castings, except for Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y who does not know to drive one. Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh and Tr\u00e0 My who come from the northern area had difficulty finding their way around town. The casting places include DMC's which belongs to the head judge \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1ea1nh C\u01b0\u1eddng, Valenciani's, and Kelly B\u00f9i's fashion boutique located around Ho Chi Minh city.

On the next day, at different time, each girl received a call from Her World magazine asking her to do a photoshoot for the magazine.\nFor this week's elimination photoshoot, the girls had to showcase their poses on a high wire. While Th\u00f9y Trang, Tr\u00e0 My, and L\u00ea Th\u00fay rocked the set, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh and especially Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y had to fight their fear of heights.\nAt panel, most of the girls received praise from the judges. L\u00ea Th\u00fay and Tr\u00e0 My impressed the judges with their outstanding photos. On the other hand, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh was criticized again for being too stiff, and she even confessed that she felt fading away from the judges. In the end, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh and Th\u00f9y Trang landed in the bottom two, but it was Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh who was eliminated in her fourth consecutive appearance in the bottom two since the judges felt Th\u00f9y Trang has made more progress.\n\nFirst call-out: L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Th\u00fay\nBottom two: Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh & Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u00f9y Trang\nEliminated: Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Anh\nFeatured designer: \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1ea1nh C\u01b0\u1eddng\n\n\n=== Episode 13 ===\nAir date: January 01, 2012BeU model management's director came by the house and surprised the top 4 by telling them that they were going to Singapore.

Yet, they came here not for a vacation but to experience the international working- environment in one of the biggest fashion industries of Asia. Therefore, immediately, the four remaining girls were put in a casting of Black Market, a fashion franchise in Singapore. L\u00ea Th\u00fay, Th\u00f9y Trang, and Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y with their limited English struggled to understand and communicate with the foreign producers; however, they all managed to do well.\nFor the elimination photoshoot, the themes of this week were to be sexy and appealing.

However, while Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y was still criticized for being a bit stiff, Th\u00f9y Trang struggled to beautify her eye and facial expression, and L\u00ea Th\u00fay was so fragile that she hardened herself. Consequently, Xu\u00e2n Lan handed L\u00ea Th\u00fay and Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00f9y the final two photos, meaning Th\u00f9y Trang was eliminated even though she won the reward for having the best catwalk during the fashion show.

Some critics, however, have complained that this panel, which boasts loads of fashion industry expertise in Vietnam, but has no international experience is in contrast with axed panels.\n Ms. Th\u00fay Nga from Elite Vietnam responded through an interview with VTC News about qualification of a Top Model. She stated mostly body shapes of finalists are rough, not proportioned and the face of no one has inspired her. She also emphasized 'being a Top Model for 3 months is unbelievable'. She thought the competition is possibly considered a game show of recreation, so in this point of view audience should be softer and get funnier when watching.\nBeside, judges and finalists are harshly criticized. Public reports pointed out judges acted to cast member in a very unacceptable manner. If the judges worried about someone's potential or they don't feel quite comfortable with finalists' behaviours they are able to disqualify them rather than shout at and trash them. And to cast member, for example, L\u00ea Th\u00fay's crying prior to overcoming troubles, the request from Xu\u00e2n Lan for contestant L\u00ea Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng to praise her attractiveness over landscape, Kh\u00e1nh Linh's eligibility for VNTM only by jumping to swimming pool during cold weather or times of hardly reasonable circumstances turn viewers confused. The question was spontaneously created why contestants make themselves inferior and endure being blamed. BUT overall as can be shown the girls have extremely strong desire to have lifetime-changing chance regarding fame and they will do whatever to achieve it even they must pay for it.\nLike other NTM franchises, the results of unaired episodes have been leaked out. Representative of producers, Ms. Qu\u1ef3nh Trang expresses daring to file lawsuit against Ho\u00e0ng Oanh, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Nghi and another contestant (pointedly Th\u00f9y D\u01b0\u01a1ng) for spoiling and leaking info before the date on which they were officially evicted. Furthermore, Ms. Qu\u1ef3nh Trang warned the other contestants and revealed the producers and the legal team are in progress of watching out. In addition, three girls are axed from live final runway show.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVietnam's Next Top Model Official Site\nApplication Form",

        "wiki": "Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh), also commonly referred to as Saigon, is the largest city of Vietnam. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9 million within city proper and over 21 million within the metropolitan area. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Ho Chi Minh City is the economic and financial centre of Vietnam, and plays an important role in the country's culture and scientific developments.\nPrior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had been part of historic kingdoms of Funan, Champa, and Khmer successively. With the arrival of the Vietnamese, the area became more prosperous and officials began establishing the city from 1623 to 1698. After ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city underwent urbanisation to become an important economic centre in the region. The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the government of a unified Vietnam renamed Saigon to its current official name in honour of the communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nHo Chi Minh City is a regional force in finance and business, classified as a Beta city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city is an emerging international tourist destination, with popular landmarks related to the remnants of its colonial past showcased through colonial architecture. A major transportation hub, the city hosts the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, the busiest airport in Vietnam. With rapid economic development, Ho Chi Minh City is undergoing constructions of new high-tech zones and education institutions, and serves as a major media and entertainment centre.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups.\nOriginally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire\nknown as Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a), it is\nstill known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians today.\nIn time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Dinh (\u5609\u5b9a), a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, westernized as Sa\u00efgon,\nalthough the city was still indicated as \u5609\u5b9a on Vietnamese maps written in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891.The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to honor Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora.\nHowever, there is a technical difference between the two terms: S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers more to the entire modern city with all its urban and rural districts.\n\n\n=== Saigon ===\n\nAn etymology of Saigon (or S\u00e0i G\u00f2n in Vietnamese) is that S\u00e0i is a Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u67f4) meaning \"firewood, lops, twigs; palisade\", while G\u00f2n is another Sino-Vietnamese word (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u68cd) meaning \"stick, pole, bole\", and whose meaning evolved into \"cotton\" in Vietnamese (b\u00f4ng g\u00f2n, literally \"cotton stick\", i.e., \"cotton plant\", then shortened to g\u00f2n). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C\u00e2y Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon (\u5824 \u5cb8), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means \"embankment\" (French: quais), and Vietnamese Sai C\u00f4n, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1793\u1782\u179a). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' \u2013 thus, \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\".Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1793\u1782\u179a), \"Royal City\"; later locally corrupted to \"Prey kor\", meaning \"kapok forest\", from which \"Saigon\" was derived (\"kor\" meaning \"kapok\" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as \"g\u00f2n\").\n\n\n=== Ho Chi Minh City ===\nThe current official name, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, adopted in 1976 and abbreviated TP.HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as H\u00f4-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e; Ch\u00ed meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\". Nowadays, Saigon is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, whereas Ho Chi Minh City is used to refer to the whole city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Khmer period ===\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. When the Cham Empire was invaded by the Khmer people, Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor, which meant \"Forest City\". An alternative name was Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle, meant \"Royal City\". Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest. This area is likely where modern Ho Chi Minh City now lies, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty rule ===\n\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== French colonial era ===\n\nColonized by France and Spain in 1859, and ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was influenced by the French during their colonisation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.In 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon consisting of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon was formed. Sa\u00efgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the r\u00e9gion of Sa\u00efgon\u2013Cholon became a single city called Sa\u00efgon following the merger of the two cities of Sa\u00efgon and Cholon.\n\n\n=== Republic of Vietnam era ===\n\nThe Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the abandonment of anti-colonialist policies, the U.S. (in an attempt to control the spread of communism) supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh.Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the \u0110\u00f4 Th\u00e0nh S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (Capital City Saigon), or Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 S\u00e0i G\u00f2n (National Capital Saigon).\nSouth Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong proxy forces during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, on the other hand, were supported by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Post-Vietnam War and today ===\nIn the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the \"Fall of Saigon\", while the Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the \"Liberation of Saigon\". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. However, the former name Saigon is still widely used by the Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHo Chi Minh City is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi. The average elevation is 19 metres (62 ft) above sea level. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province to the east, Long An Province to the west and the East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is 47 km (29 mi).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical savanna climate, with an average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 millimetres (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April. The average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\n\n\n=== Flooding ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Dong Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to flood.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nHo Chi Minh City is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 24 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2003):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 259 wards (as of 2006, see List of HCMC administrative units below).\n\n\n=== City government ===\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments. The legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 95 members. The current Chairwoman is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ec7. The judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current Judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong. The executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Nh\u00e2n. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked forth.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level.\nThe city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. The population of the city is expanding faster than earlier predictions. In August 2017 the city's mayor, Nguyen Thanh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310 million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13 million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%. Ho Chi Minh City's largest minority ethnic group are the Chinese (Hoa) with 5.78%. Cholon \u2013 in District 5 and parts of Districts 6, 10 and 11 \u2013 is home to the largest Chinese community in Vietnam. The Hoa (Chinese) speak a number of varieties of Chinese, including Cantonese, Teochew (Chaozhou), Hokkien, Hainanese and Hakka; smaller numbers also speak Mandarin Chinese.

To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australia's Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phu My Hung's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km 10\u201314 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City are mainly related to periods of French colonization and the Vietnam War. The city's center has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t), City Hall (\u1ee6y ban nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), Municipal Theatre (Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (B\u01b0u \u0111i\u1ec7n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1), State Bank Office (Ng\u00e2n h\u00e0ng nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc), City People's Court (T\u00f2a \u00e1n nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1) and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd \u0110\u1ee9c B\u00e0) the cathedral was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels are the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.The city has various museums including the Ho Chi Minh City Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nha Rong Memorial House, and the Ben Duoc Relic of Underground Tunnels.

The \u0110\u1ea7m Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Amusement and Culture Park, and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh theatre, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. Ho Chi Minh City is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60\u201370% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of Ho Chi Minh City keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as ph\u1edf or rice vermicelli. Backpacking travellers most often frequent the \"Backpackers\u2019 Quarter\" on Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Street and B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n Street, District 1.It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited Ho Chi Minh City.\nAccording to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.According to Mastercard's 2019 report, Ho Chi Minh City is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after Hanoi with 4.8 million visitors).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic). Long Th\u00e0nh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Th\u00e0nh District, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Th\u00e0nh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t Airport will serve domestic flights.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHo Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. HCMC Ferrybus was also established as a maritime public transport.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be completed by the end of 2021. This first line will connect B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham Luong in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District. \n\n\n=== Private transport ===\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\n\n\n=== Expressway ===\n\nHo Chi Minh City has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Luong Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta. The second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thanh - Dau Giay Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam. The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khanh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch\u1ee3 R\u1eaby Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in South-East Asia.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nNotable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph\u1ed5 Th\u00f4ng N\u0103ng Khi\u1ebfu High School for the Gifted, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a High School for the Gifted, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Hi\u1ec1n High School, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai High School, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh High School, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n High School, Marie Curie High School, V\u00f5 Th\u1ecb S\u00e1u High School and among others.

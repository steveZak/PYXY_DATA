        "wiki": "The Aljafer\u00eda Palace (Spanish: Palacio de la Aljafer\u00eda; Arabic: \u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0629\u200e, tr. Qa\u1e63r al-Ja\u02bffariyah) is a fortified medieval palace built during the second half of the 11th century in the Taifa of Zaragoza in Al-Andalus, present day Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. It was the residence of the Banu Hud dynasty during the era of Abu Jaffar Al-Muqtadir. The palace reflects the splendour attained by the Taifa of Zaragoza at the height of its grandeur. It currently contains the Cortes (regional parliament) of the autonomous community of Aragon.The structure holds unique importance in that it is the only conserved testimony of a large building of Spanish Islamic architecture of the era of the Taifas (independent kingdoms). The Aljaferia, along with the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba and the Alhambra are the three best examples of Hispano-Muslim architecture and have special legal protection. In 2001, the original restored structures of the Aljafer\u00eda were included in the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon, a World Heritage Site.The solutions adopted in the ornamentation of the Aljafer\u00eda, such as the use of mixtilinear arcs and springers, the extension of arabesque in large area, and the schematisation and progressive abstraction of the yeserias of a vegetal nature, decisively influenced Almoravid and Almohad art in the Iberian Peninsula. The transition of the decoration towards more geometric motifs is at the basis of Nasrid art.\nAfter the reconquest of Zaragoza in 1118 by Alfonso I of Arag\u00f3n, it became the residence of the Christian kings of the Kingdom of Arag\u00f3n. It was used as a royal residence by Peter IV of Arag\u00f3n (1319-1387) and later, on the main floor, the reform was carried out that converted these rooms into the palace of the Catholic Monarchs in 1492. In 1593 it underwent another restructuring that would turn it into a military fortress, first according to Renaissance designs (which today can be seen in its surroundings, moat and gardens) and later for quartering military regiments. It underwent continuous restructuring and damage, especially with the Sieges of Zaragoza of the Peninsular War, until, unusually for historical buildings in Spain, it was finally restored in the 20th century.\nThe palace was built outside Zaragoza's Roman walls, in the plain of the sar\u00eda. With urban expansion over the centuries, it is now inside the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nMost Aljaferi\u00e1 was completed by Abu Jaffar Al-Muqtadir during the Banu Hud reign in the taifa of Zaragoza, in the 11th century.\nAfter the reconquest of Zaragoza in 1118 by Alfonso of Aragon \"the Battler\", the Aljafer\u00eda became the residence of the Christian kings of Aragon, becoming the main focus of the Aragonese Mudejar diffusion. It was used as a royal residence by Peter IV of Aragon \"the Ceremonious\" and later, on the main floor, was carried out the reform that turned these paradors into the palace of the Catholic Monarchs in 1492. In 1593 it underwent another reform that would make it into a military fortress, first according to Renaissance designs (which today can be seen in their surroundings, pit and gardens) and later as a quarters of military regiments. It underwent continuous reforms and major damage, especially during the Sieges of Saragossa of the Napoleonic French invasion, until finally it was restored in the second half of the twentieth century and currently houses the Parliament of Aragon.\nOriginally the building was outside the Roman walls, in the plain of the Sar\u00eda or place where the Muslims developed the military fanfare known as La Almozara. With the urban expansion through the years, the building has remained within the city. There is a small space with landscaped garden environment.\n\n\n== Troubadour Tower ==\n\nThe oldest construction of the Aljafer\u00eda is today known as the Troubadour Tower. The tower received this name from Antonio Garcia Gutierrez\u2019s 1836 romantic drama The Troubadour, based on the palace. This drama became a libretto for Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s opera Il trovatore in 1853.\n\nThe tower is a defensive structure, with a quadrangular base and five levels which date back to the end of the 9th century AD, in the period governed by the first Banu Tujib, Muhammad Alanqur, who was named after Muhammad I of C\u00f3rdoba, independent Emir of  Cordoba. According to Caba\u00f1ero Subiza (1998) the Tower was built in the second half of the 10th century. In its lower part, the tower contains vestiges of the beginning of the heavy walls of alabaster ashlar bond masonry, and continues upwards with plank lining of simple plaster and lime concrete, which is a thinner substance for reaching greater heights. The exterior does not reflect the division of the five internal floors and appears as an enormous prism, broken by narrow embrasures. Access to the interior was gained through a small door at such height that it was only possible to enter by means of a portable ladder. Its initial function was, by all indications, military.\nThe first level conserves the building structure of the 9th century and shelters two separated naves and six sections, which are separated by means of two cruciform pillars and divided by lowered horseshoe arcs. In spite of its simplicity, they form a balanced space and could be used as baths.\nThe second floor repeats the same spatial scheme of the previous one, and remains of a Muslim factory of the 11th century in the brick canvases, which indicates that, from the 14th century something similar happens with the appearance of the last two floors, of Mud\u00e9jar invoice, and whose construction would be due to the construction of the palace of Peter IV of Aragon, that is connected with the Tower of the Troubadour thanks to a corridor, and would be configured as tower of homage. The arches of these plants already reflect its Christian structure, because they are slightly pointed arches, and support unveiled roofs, but flat structures in wood.\nIts function in the 9th and 10th centuries was the watch tower and defensive bastion. It was surrounded by a moat. It was later integrated by the Banu Hud family in the construction of the castle-palace of the Aljafer\u00eda, constituting itself in one of the towers of the defensive framework of the outside north canvas. From the Spanish Reconquista, it continued being used like tower of the homage and in 1486 became dungeon of the Inquisition. As a tower-prison was also used in the 18th and 19th centuries, as demonstrated by the numerous graffiti inscribed there by the p2.\n\n\n== Moorish Taifal palace ==\n\nThe building of the palace \u2013 mostly made between 1065 and 1081\u2014  was ordered by Ab\u00fa Ja'far Ahmad ibn Sulaym\u00e1n al-Muqtadir Billah, known by his honorary title of Al-Muqtadir (The powerful), second monarch of the Banu Hud dynasty, as a symbol of the power achieved by the Taifa of Zaragoza in the second half of the 11th century. The sultan himself called his palace \"Qasr al-Surur\" (Palace of the Joy) and to the throne room which he presided the receptions and embassies of the \"Maylis al-Dahab\" (Golden Hall) as it is testified in the following verses of the Sultan self:\n\n Oh Palace of the Joy!, Oh Golden Hall!Because of you, I reached the maximum of my wishes.\nAnd even though in my kingdom I had nothing else,\nfor me you are everything I could wish for.\nThe name of Aljafer\u00eda is first documented in a text by Al-Yazzar as-Saraqusti (active between 1085 and 1100) \u2013 which also transmits the name of the architect of the Taifal palace, the Slav Al-Halifa Zuhayr\u2014 and another from Ibn Idari of 1109, as a derivation from the pre-name of Al-Muqtadir, Abu Ya'far, and \"Ya'far\", \"Al-Yafariyya\", which evolved to \"Aliafaria\" and from there to \"Aljafer\u00eda\".\nThe general layout of the whole palace adopts the archetype of the castles of the desert of Syria and Jordan of the first half of the 8th century (such as Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, Msatta, Jirbat al-Mafyar, and from the first Abbasid stage, the castle of Ujaydir) which were square-shaped and ultrasemicircular towers in its cloths, with a central tripartite space, which leaves three rectangular spaces of which the central one houses a courtyard with pools and, at the northern and southern ends of the same, the palatial rooms and the dependencies of daily life.\n\nIn the Aljafer\u00eda, this castle-palace model is honored, whose noble zone is located in the central segment of its square plant, although the alignment of the sides of this plant is irregular. It is the central rectangle that houses the palatial dependencies, organized around a courtyard with cisterns in front of the north and south porticos to which the rooms and royal saloons are poured.\nAt the north and south ends are the porticos and room dependencies, and in the case of the Aljafer\u00eda, the most important of these sectors is the north, that in origin was endowed with a second plant and had greater depth, besides being preceded by an open and profusely decorated column wall that stretched in two arms by two pavilions on its flanks and served as a theatrical porch to the throne room (the golden hall of the verses of Al-Muqtadir) located at the bottom. It produced a set of heights and cubic volumes beginning with the perpendicular corridors of the ends, it was emphasized by the presence of the height of the second floor and ended with the tower of the troubadour that offered its volume in the background to the look of a spectator located in the courtyard. All this, reflected also in the cistern, enhanced the royal area, which is corroborated by the presence at the eastern end of the northern border of a small private mosque with mihrab.\nIn the center of the northern wall of the interior of the Golden Hall was a blind arch \u2013 where the king stood \u2013 in whose thread was a very traditional geometric pattern imitating the latticework of the mihrab fa\u00e7ade of the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, building to which it was sought to emulate. In this way, from the courtyard, it appeared half-hidden by the plots of columns of both the archway of access to the Golden Hall and those of the immediate portico, which gave an appearance of latticework, an illusion of depth, which admired the visitor and lent splendor to the figure of the monarch.\n\nIn order to remember the appearance of the palace at the end of the 11th century, we must imagine that all the vegetal, geometric and epigraphic reliefs were polychromed in shades in which red and blue predominated for backgrounds and gold for reliefs, which, together with the soffits in alabaster with epigraphic decoration and the floors of white marble, gave the whole an aspect of great magnificence.\nThe various avatars suffered by the Aljafer\u00eda, have made disappear from this layout of the 11th century a large part of the stuccos that made up the decoration and, with the construction of the palace of the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, the entire second floor, which broke the ends of the Taifal arches. In the current restoration, the original arabesques are observed in darker color and in white and smooth finishes the reconstruction of plaster of the decoration the arches, whose structure, however, remains undamaged.\nThe decoration of the walls of the Golden Hall has disappeared for the most part, although remains of its decoration are preserved in the Museo de Zaragoza and in the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid. Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez began its restoration, restoring the decorations that existed in its places of origin and extracting complete emptyings of the arcades of the south portico.\nThese were the functions and aspect of the 11th century Banu Hud palace. Below are the most important parts of the building as they are today.\n\n\n=== North side halls ===\n\nIn the north wall, the most important complex of buildings of the Banu Hud period is built, as it includes the Throne Room or Golden Hall and the small private mosque, located on the eastern side of the access portico that serves as an antechamber to the oratory). In its interior it houses a mihrab in the southeast corner, whose niche, therefore, is oriented in the direction of Mecca, as it happens in all the mosques except in the one of C\u00f3rdoba.\nThe soils of the royal stays were of marble and walked them a plinth of alabaster. The capitels were of alabaster, except some of reused marble of Caliphate period. These rooms were surrounded by a band of epigraphic decoration with Kufic characters reproducing Quran surahs that alluded to the symbolic meaning of ornamentation. The surahs corresponding to these inscriptions have been deduced from the surviving fragments.\nIn two of these calligraphic reliefs can be the name of Al-Muqtadir, reason why the construction of the palace has been dated, at least in a first phase, between 1065 and 1080. They say verbatim \"This [= the Aljafer\u00eda] was ordered by Ahmed al-Muqtadir Bill\u00e1h\".\n\n\n=== Golden Hall ===\n\nThe Golden Hall had at its ends east and west two rooms that were private bedrooms possibly of royal use. Today the bedroom of the western flank has been lost, which was used as a royal bedroom and also used the Aragonese kings until the 14th century.\nMost of the yeserias of arabesques, which carpeted the walls of these stays with decorative panels plastered with plaster, as well as an alabaster base of two and a half meters high and the white marble floors of the original palace, have been lost. The remains that have been preserved, both in museums and the few that are in this royal hall, nevertheless allow to reconstruct the appearance of this polychrome decoration, which, in its day, should have been splendid.\nCeilings, wood carvings, reproduced the sky, and the whole room was an image of the cosmos, clothed with symbols of the power exercised over the celestial universe by the monarch of Saragossa, who thus appeared as heir to the caliphs.\nThe access to the Golden Hall is made through a canvas with three vanes. A very large central one, consisting of five double marble columns with very stylized Islamic alabaster capitals that support four mixtilinear arches, among which, in height, there are other simpler horseshoe.\n\n\n=== Entrance portico to the Golden Hall ===\n\nTowards the south, another dependence of similar size is poured that it pours to the courtyard by a portico of great polilobulated arcades. Again there is a tripartite space, and its east and west ends extend perpendicularly with two lateral galleries which are accessed by wide polyhedral lobes and which end at the end of their arms in separate pointed arches also polilobulated whose alfiz is decorated by complex laqueus and reliefs of arabesques.\nThis whole structure seeks an appearance of solemnity and majesty that the scant depth of these stays would not give a spectator to access the king's room. In addition, all the ornamentation of yeserias of the palace was polychrome in shades of blue and red in the back and gold in the arabesques. Among the filigrees is the representation of a bird, an unusual zoomorphic figure in Islamic art that could represent a pigeon, a pheasant or a symbol of the king as winged.\nThe traces of interlocking mixtilinear arches are characteristic of this palace and are given for the first time in the Aljafer\u00eda, from where they will be diffused to the future Islamic constructions.\nOn the eastern side of the portico is a sacred space, the mosque, which is accessed through a portal inspired by caliph art and described below.\n\n\n=== Mosque and the oratory ===\n\nAt the eastern end of the entrance portico to the Golden Hall, there is a small mosque or private oratory for use by the monarch and his courtiers. It is accessed through a portal that ends in a horseshoe arch inspired by the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba but with S-shaped springers, a novelty that will imitate the Almoravid art and Nasrid art. This arch rests on two columns with capitals of leaves very geometricals, in the line of the realizations Granadan art of solutions in Moc\u00e1rabe. Its alfiz is profusely ornamented with vegetal decoration and on it is arranged a frieze of half-point arcs crossed.\nAlready inside the oratory there is a reduced space of square plant but with chamfered corners, that turns it into a false octagonal plant. In the southeast sector, oriented towards Mecca, is located the niche of the mihrab. The front of the mihrab is conformed by a very traditional horseshoe arch, with Cordoban shapes and alternating camouflage threads, some decorated with vegetal reliefs and other smooth ones (although originally they were decorated with pictorial decoration), reminiscent of the mihrab thread of the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, only what were rich materials (mosaics and Byzantine bricklayers) in Zaragoza, with greater material poverty than the Caliphian C\u00f3rdoba, are plaster stucco and polychrome, the latter having been lost in almost the entire Palace. Continuing with the arch of the portal, an alfiz framed its back, in whose curved triangles two mirrored rosettes are recessed, as is the dome of the interior of the mihrab.\n\nThe rest of the walls of the mosque are decorated with blind mixtilineal arches linked and decorated throughout the surface with vegetable arabesques of Caliph's inspiration. These arches lean on columns topped with capitals of slender basket. A slab of square marble slabs covers the bottom of the walls of the mosque.\nAll this is topped with a splendid theory of interlocking polyblocked arches, which, in this case, are not blind in their entirety, because those in the chamfered corners let now see the angles of the square plant structure. This gallery is the only one that conserves remains of the pictorial decoration of the 11th century, whose motives were rescued by Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez Almech after removing the liming with which they were covered after the passage of the Aljafer\u00eda to chapel. Unfortunately, this restorer, praiseworthy for having saved from the ruin of the monument, worked in an age of different criteria to the present ones, because he intended to restore all the elements to their original appearance. For this he repainted with acrylic paint the traces of Islamic remains, which makes this performance irreversible and, consequently, we will never see the, although very faded, original pigment.\nThe dome of the mosque was not preserved, because that is the height in which the palace of the Catholic Monarchs was built; However, the characteristic octagonal plant suggests that the solution should follow literally the existing ones in the maqsurah of the mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, that is to say, a dome of semicircular arches that are interlaced forming an octagon in the center. The covering proposal of Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez is, however, in this case, reversible, as it is a detachable dome of plaster. In 2006, Bernab\u00e9 Caba\u00f1ero Subiza, C. Lasa Gracia and J. L. Mateo L\u00e1zaro postulated that \"the nerves of the vault [...] should have the section of horseshoe arches forming an eight-pointed star pattern with a dome agglomerated in the center, as those existing in the two domes of the transept of the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n=== South side halls ===\nCompleting the tour of the 11th-century palace, one arrives at the south portico, which consists of an arcade on its southern flank that gives access to a portico with two lateral stays.\nThis portico was the vestibule of a great south hall that would have the same tripartite disposition of the existent one in the north side, and of which only the arcades of access of mixtilineal arches of geometric decoration remains. Perhaps in this southern sector the greatest daring in arches, through the interlocking of lobulated forms, mixtilinea, and the inclusion of small reliefs of shafts and capitals with exclusively ornamental function.\nThe complexity of laqueus, arabesques and carvings leads to a Baroque aesthetic, which is a prelude to the filigree of the art of the Alhambra and which are some of the most beautiful of all Al-Andalusian art.\n\n\n== Courtyard of Santa Isabel ==\n\nIt is the open and landscaped space that unified the whole Taifal palace. To it would pour the north and south porticos, and probably rooms and outbuildings to the east and west of this central courtyard.\nIts name comes from the birth in the Aljafer\u00eda of the infanta Elizabeth of Aragon, that was in 1282 Queen of Portugal. The original pool of the south has been conserved, whereas the one of the north front, of the 14th century, has been covered with a wood floor. The restoration tried to give the courtyard the original splendor, and for that a marble floor was arranged in the corridors that surround the orange and flower garden.\nThe arcade that is contemplated looking towards the south portico is restored by means of the emptying of the original arcs that are deposited in the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid and in the Museo de Zaragoza . They suppose the greater audacity and distance for their innovation with respect to the caliphs models of the arcades of the north side.\nAccording to Christian Ewert, who has studied for fifteen years the arches of the Aljafer\u00eda, the more related to noble zones (Golden Hall and Mosque) are the ornaments of the arcades, more respect they have to the C\u00f3rdoban tradition from which they leave.\n\n\n== Palace of Peter IV of Aragon \"the Ceremonious\" ==\nAfter the taking of Saragossa by Alfonso the Battler in 1118, the Aljafer\u00eda was habilitated like palace of the kings of Aragon and the church, not being substantially modified until the 14th century with the performance of Peter IV of Aragon \"the Ceremonious\".\n\nThis king extended the palatial dependencies in 1336 and had constructed the Church of San Mart\u00edn in the entrance courtyard to the alc\u00e1zar. In this time the use of the Aljafer\u00eda is documented like place of departure of the route that took to Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza, where the Aragonese monarchs were solemnly crowned and they swore the Fueros of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Chapel of San Mart\u00edn ===\nThe chapel of San Mart\u00edn takes advantage of the canvases of the northwest corner of the wall, to the point that one of its towers was used as sacristy and gave name to the courtyard that gives access to the Taifal enclosure.\nThe factory, of Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar style, consists of two naves of three sections each, in origin orientated to the east and supported in two pillars with semicolumns attached in the half of the faces of the pillar, whose section is remembered in the quadrilobed that shelter the shield of arms of the King of Aragon in the spandrels of the portal, that is already of the first decade of the 15th century and in which we will stop later.\n\nThe vaults of these naves, of simple rib vault, are lodged on formeros arches and pointed perpia\u00f1os arches, whereas the diagonals are of half point. At the corners of the vaults appear florets with the coat of arms of the Aragonese monarchy. Of its decoration only fragments of the pictorial covering and some mixtilineal arches are preserved directly inspired in the Muslim palace.\nIt emphasizes in the exterior the Mud\u00e9jar portal of brick referred to previously, built in the time of Martin of Aragon \"the Humane\" and opened in the last section of the south nave.\nThis portal is articulated by a carpanel arch very recessed, covered by another pointed of greater dimensions. Framing both, a double alfiz decorated with taqueado jaqu\u00e9s motifs forming lozenge cloths.\n\nIn the spandrels, as it was pointed out, two quadrilobed medallions appear that harbor shields with the image of the insignia of king of Aragon. In the resulting tympanum between the arches there is a band of interlocking mixtilineal blind arches, which again refer to the series of the Banu Hud palace. This strip is interrupted by a box that houses a newly incorporated relief.\nThe chapel was remodeled in the 18th century, placing a nave ahead of it and covering the Mud\u00e9jar portal previously described. The pillars and walls were refurbished and plastered to the Neoclassical style. All the reform was eliminated during the restorations of Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez, although by the existing photographic documentation, it is known that there was a slender tower that now appears with a crenellated finish inspired by the aspect of the Mud\u00e9jar church, and in the 18th century culminated with a curious bulbous spire.\n\n\n=== Mud\u00e9jar Palace ===\nIt is not an independent palace, but an extension of the Muslim palace that was still in use. Peter IV of Aragon tried to provide more spacious rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms to the Aljafer\u00eda, because the Taifal bedrooms had remained small for the use of the Ceremonious.\nThese new rooms are grouped on the northern sector of the Al-Andalusian palace, at different levels of height. This new Mud\u00e9jar factory was extraordinarily respectful of the pre-existing construction, both in plan and elevation, and is made up of three large rectangular halls covered by extraordinary aljarfes or wooden mud\u00e9jar ceilings.\nAlso from this time is the western arcade of pointed arches of the Patio de Santa Isabel, intrados in lobed arcs, and a small bedroom of square plant and covered with an octagonal dome of wood and a curious door of entrance in pointed arc of lobed intrados circumscribed in a very fine alfiz, whose spandrel is decked out of arabesque. This door leads to a triple lodge of semicircular arches. The bedroom is located on the building block above the mosque.\n\n\n== Palace of the Catholic Monarchs ==\nIn the last years of the 15th century the Catholic Monarchs ordered to construct a palace for royal use on the north wing of the Al-Andalusian enclosure, configuring a second plant superposed to the one of the existing palace. The building broke the high parts of the Taifal stays, where inserted the beams that would support the new palace.\n\nThe works are dated between 1488 and 1495 and were followed by Mud\u00e9jar masters, maintained the tradition of Mud\u00e9jar bricklayers in the Aljafer\u00eda.\nThe palace is accessed by climbing the noble staircase, a monumental building composed of two large sections with geometric yeserias gables illuminated by half-angled windows of small decoration of leaves and stems of Gothic roots and Mud\u00e9jar influences, topped in crochet on the key of the arches.\nThe grandiose ceiling, as in the rest of the palace buildings, is covered with superb cross-vaulted vaults arranged between the j\u00e1cenas, and they are decorated with tempera painting with iconographic motifs related to the Catholic Monarchs: the yoke and the arrows alternate with squares of decoration in grisao of grotesques and candelieri, that announces the typical decoration of the Renaissance.\nThe stairs give access to a corridor in the first floor that communicates with the palatial dependencies proper. It opens to a gallery of columns of torso stem that rest on shoes with anthropomorphic reliefs at their ends. To support this viewpoint and the rest of the new dependencies it was necessary to section the high areas of the Taifal halls of the 11th century and to have before the north portico five powerful octagonal pillars that, next to some archways pointed behind them, form a new antepartum that unites The two Al-Andalusian perpendicular pavilions above.\nIt emphasizes the main entrance to the Throne Room: a trilobed recessed arch with a five-lobed tympanum, at the center of which is represented the coat of arms of the monarchy of the Catholic Monarchs, which includes the coats of arms of the kingdoms of Castile, Le\u00f3n, Aragon, Sicily and Granada, supported by two lieutenant lions. The rest of the decorative field is finished with a delicate vegetal ornamentation of stamped invoice, which reappears in the capitals of the jambs. The entire portal is made of hardened plaster, which is the predominant material in the interior of the Aljafer\u00eda, as Mud\u00e9jar craftsmen perpetuate the materials and techniques that are common in Islam.\nIn the same wall, two large windows of triple mixtilineal arc with shutters on their keys are escorted by the entrance, thanks to which the inner space of the royal rooms is illuminated.\nOnce the space of the gallery is crossed, several rooms are arranged that precede to the great Throne Room, that are denominated \"rooms of the lost steps\". These are three small rooms of square plan communicated to each other by big windows shut with lattices that give to the Patio de San Mart\u00edn, and that served as waiting rooms for those who were to be received in audience by the kings.\n\nIn our days only two are visible, because the third one was closed when replacing the dome of the mosque. Its roof was moved to a room adjoining the Throne Room.\nOne of the most valuable elements of these rooms are their floors, which originally were square azulejos and hexagonal ceramic alfardones glazed in colors, forming capricious borders. They were made in the historic pottery of Loza de Muel at the end of the 15th century. From the preserved fragments has been set to restore the entire floor with ceramics that mimics the shape and layout of the former floor, but not its quality glazed reflections.\nThe other remarkable element is its excellent Mud\u00e9jar-Catholic Monarchs style roofs, constituted by three magnificent taujeles of Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar carpenters. These ceilings present geometric reticules of wood later carved, painted and gilded with gold leaf, whose moldings show the well-known heraldic motifs of the Catholic Monarchs: the yoke, the arrows and the Gordian knot united to the classic motto \"Tanto monta\" (both mounts to undo the Gordian knot), both mounts to cut it as to untie it, according to the well-known anecdote attributed to Alexander the Great), as well as a good number of leaflet florets finished with pendant (pinjante) pineapples.\n\n\n=== Throne Room ===\nMore complex and difficult to describe is the magnificence and sumptuousness of the ceiling that covers the Throne Room. Its dimensions are very considerable (20 metres (66 feet) in length by 8 in width) and its Artesonado coffered ceiling is supported by thick beams and sleepers decorated with laqueus that at intersections form eight-pointed stars, while generating thirty large and deep square coffins.\nInside these coffins are inscribed octagons with a central flower of curly leaf that finish in large hanging pine cones that symbolize fertility and immortality. This ceiling was reflected in the ground, which reproduces the thirty squares with their respective octagons inscribed.\n\nUnder the Artesonado coffered ceiling there is an airy gallery of passable arches and with open windows, from which the guests could contemplate the royal ceremonies. Finally, all this structure is based on an arrocabe with moldings in carved navicella with vegetal and zoomorphic themes (cardina, branches, fruits of the vine, winged dragons, fantastic animals...), and in the frieze that surrounds the whole perimeter of the room, there appears a legend of Gothic calligraphy that reads: Ferdinandus, Hispaniarum, Siciliae, Corsicae, Balearumque rex, principum optimus, prudens, strenuus, pius, constans, iustus, felix, et Helisabeth regina, religione et animi magnitudine supra mulierem, insigni coniuges, auxiliante Christo, victoriosissimi, post liberatam a mauris Bethycam, pulso veteri feroque hoste, hoc opus construendum curarunt, anno salutis MCCCCLXXXXII.\nThe translation of this inscription is: Ferdinand, King of the Spains, Sicily, Corsica and Balearic, the best one of the princes, prudent, courageous, pious, constant, just, jocose, and Isabella, queen, superior to all woman because her pity and greatness of spirit, distinguished matrimony very victorious with the help of Christ, after liberating Andalusia from Moors, expelled the old and ferocious enemy, ordered to build this work the year of the Salvation of 1492.\n\n\n== Early-Modern and Modern times ==\nAt the beginning of 1486, the area of the Patio de San Mart\u00edn was destined to the headquarters of the Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition and facilities were installed adjacent to the courtyard to house the officers of this organization. It is likely that this is the origin of the use as a prison of the Tower of the Troubadour.\nThe new function (which lasted until the early-18th century) triggered an event that would culminate in a reform project undertaken under the mandate of Philip II of Spain by which he would henceforth become a military base. In 1591, in the events known as the Alterations of Aragon, the persecuted secretary of King Philip II, Antonio P\u00e9rez took refuge at the Privilege of Manifestation contemplated by the Fuero of Aragon in order to elude the imperial troops. However, the Tribunal of the Inquisition had jurisdiction over all the fueros of the kingdoms, and, for that reason, he was held in a cell of the inquisitorial headquarters of the Aljafer\u00eda, which provoked an uprising of the people before what they considered a violation of the foral law, and they went to the assault of the Aljafer\u00eda to rescue him. After the forceful action of the royal army, the revolt was put down, and Philip II decided to consolidate the Aljafer\u00eda as a fortified citadel under his authority to prevent similar revolts.\n\nThe design of the work, which consisted of a military construction, was entrusted to the Italian-Sienese military engineer, Tiburzio Spannocchi. He constructed a set of habitat attached to the south and east walls that hid the ultrasemicircular turrets in its interior, although in the east fa\u00e7ade it did not affect those who flanked the entrance door and these onwards. Surrounding the entire building, a marlon wall was erected leaving inside a round space and ending at its four corners in four pentagonal bastions, whose starts can be seen today. The entire complex was surrounded by a moat twenty meters wide, which was saved by two drawbridges on the east and north flanks.\nThe Aljafer\u00eda remained without substantial changes until 1705, in which due to the War of Spanish Succession it was lodging of two companies of French troops that took to a regrowth of the parapets of the low wall of the pit effected by the military engineer Dezveheforz.\n\nBut the decisive transformation as quartering took place in 1772 at the initiative of Charles III of Spain, in which all the facades were remodeled to the way in which the western one is presently, and that the interior spaces were used as dependencies for the soldiers and officers who were staying in the building. In the western third of the palace was set up a large courtyard to which the rooms of the different companies, made with simplicity and functionality, following the rationalist spirit of the second half of the 18th century and the practical purpose to which the constructed areas were destined so. Only the addition in 1862 by Isabella II of Spain of four Gothic-Revival towers, of which the ones located in the north-western and south-western corner, stand today.\nIt was precisely in the mid-19th century when Mariano Nougu\u00e9s Secall raised the alarm due to the deterioration of the al-Andalusian and Mud\u00e9jar remains of the palace in its 1845 report entitled Descripci\u00f3n e historia del castillo de la Aljafer\u00eda, a rigorous study in which it was urged to preserve this valuable historical-artistic ensemble. Even the Queen Isabella II of Spain contributed funds for the restoration, and a commission was created in 1848 to undertake it; but in 1862 the Aljafer\u00eda passed from property of the Royal Patrimony to the Ministry of the War, which aborted its restoration and would aggravate the damages produced.\nThe deterioration still continued until that since 1947 was being integrally restored by the architect Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez Almech, the restoration was started and completed during the government of Francisco Franco.\nIn the 1960s it was used as a military barracks, and the decoration was covered with plaster with the aim of protecting it.\nIn 1984 the regional parliamentary commission created to find a definitive headquarters to the Cortes of Aragon recommended locating the autonomous parliament into the Aljafer\u00eda Palace and the City Council of Zaragoza (owner of the building) agreed to transfer the council to a section of the building for a period of 99 years.In this way the section was adapted and the building again restored by \u00c1ngel Peropadre, Juan Antonio Souto (archaeological work), Luis Franco Lahoz and Mariano Pem\u00e1n Gav\u00edn, who carried out for the location of the headquarters of the Cortes de Aragon. The Aljafer\u00eda was finally declared an artistic and historical monument in 1998 with presence of prince Philip VI.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBORR\u00c1S GUALIS, Gonzalo (1991). \"La ciudad isl\u00e1mica\".

It\u2019s a very cheap way to spend a couple of hours with a family especially as it sits in beautiful parkland in the city centre. There are no furnishings but the ornate ceilings are well",
          "If one is unable to go to Alhambra, the palacio de la aljaferia gives an insight into the moorish history of Spain. While the aljaferia pales in comparison to the Alhambra, it nevertheless is worthy of a visit to have a more in depth understanding of Spain\u2019s history.",
          "For the lover of Moorish ancient Architecture, this is another wonder, worth to spend sometimes to explore.",
          "We are fortunate to have visited many places, not just in Spain, which have been preserved and not renovated to how they used to be. It felt more like a modern replica of the original . We missed out on audio guide at the beginning as it did not come with our pensioner tickets .",
          "This was our first time to visit Zaragoza, and we were excited to see the Palacio de la Aljaferia. It is absolutely stunning and interesting if you enjoy historical sites. I rarely take photos because my husband is an amateur photographer, but today I thought I\u2019d take a few",
          "This was amazing we spent 1 hours walking around reading all the historic notes. There was a true moorish influence and it was beautiful. Was very relaxing and staff were very helpful",
          "If there is one piece of advise I'd give anyone going to the palace is go early as it fills up very quickly. Also it's free on a Sunday so it gets very busy! My friend and I went at 10am on a Sunday and there were only a few people inside. We paid \u20ac3 for the audio guide and it",
          "I didn't check...and found, as others have before, that it was closed for the day because of a parliamentary meeting. It is still photogenic from the outside and the nearby Bull Ring is worth seeing, with some nice cafes opposite",
          "Though much restored the Palacio is visually great with lots of original decoration, especially the Moorish parts, still visible. Also the home of the Aragon regional parliament, it is host to some beautiful late middle ages interior design\u2014especially gorgeous ceilings on the",
          "Wish we had time to go in. The exterior well manicured and clean Clearly was restored and over half was modern",
          "If you have been lucky enough to visit the Real Alcazar in Seville or the Alhambra in Granada I\u2019m afraid you will be disappointed. Very small and limited access. We purchased the audio tour but would not recommend it.",
          "We almost gave up given the length of the queue. If you are tempted to do the same stick with it. The beautiful mudejar interior and ceilings of the state rooms are really worth it, Very well laid out and just enough to see for a wholly satisfying hour....it\u2019s not the Alhambra,",
          "It closes between 2 and 4 pm. For over 65 it is only one euro with I.D..get a audio guide for a longer explanation. The few sheets and booklet are not enough.There is a carved relief of st martin cutting his cloak for a beggar over his gate.",
          "Was disappointed that it was a Sunday afternoon when I tried to visit and it was already closed for the day. Still amazing to see the architecture.",
          "This large historical structure has some very beautiful Islamic Architecture. There are many rooms to view on several levels. Explainations are rarely in English but there are audio guides and hand held sheets that are in English. I know I am in Spain but English has become the",
          "Opening times are restrictive so plan ahead when visiting aljaferia. Walking around the compound to see it from the outsude and the moats is worth it (and free). Entrance is E5 for adults. Guided tours exist but mostly in Spanish and seem booked full quickly. Audioguides",
          "Worthwhile Islamic architecture palace made in 11th century.there is a garden in it's center named \"heaven garden\". There are some rooms in the second floor made by christians and are so intraeting.on the ceiling ,you can see the historical story patterns.",
          "Although mostly re-constructed, this palace is worth a brief stop. It was well-visited on the Sunday we were there but much of it was unavailable because of a legislative meeting of some sort. The carved ceilings appear to be original, and the interior is somewhat reminiscent",
          "Worth seeing. Ancient muslim's architecture and beautiful garden in center. It belongs to 11th century.",
          "A must see in Zaragoza. Make sure to take a tour (free with your entrance ticket). Such a rich History and the architecture is beautiful.",
          "It's a nice building to visit, but the overall quality of the places to visit is not giving a waw vector. Low quality of restoration, the outside looks a lot better than the inside. It also houses the parliament, the security Staff is not giving you the feeling to be welcome.",
          "Restored nicely, great tour through rooms with examples of ornaments and decorations. Great experience of 1000 years of existence",
          "The former Palace of Katherine of Aragon is relatively unknown in the UK as is Zaragoza generally. For me this was the highlight of my visit. Comparisons with the Alhambra are inevitable and for me the Palacio de la Alijaferia is on a par. The Palace was founded by the Moors",
          "Although it looks big the accessible area is only a small part. A couple of interesting festutes/rooms but a lot is partially modernised and not very interesting.",
          "lots of things to see in this palace especially our guide Lorenzo explained details of the place. Architecture and events that took place was so interesting",
          "This castle is from Moorish times originally, but taken over by the Spanish kings from the reconquista it has also 15th century gothic and renaissance features. Part of the huge building has been modernised and is in use as government office. The part that can be visited shows",
          "This massive edifice was once defense for the city proper, enjoy walking the grounds and take your photo ops...visit the museum and see weaponry and artifacts from centuries gone by.",
          "What a beautiful palace to visit in Zaragoza! The moorish style was a nice break from the traditional Spanish churches and buildings. We had originally tried to visit on Saturday, but arrived during siesta and couldn\u2019t go in. We returned on Sunday to find that it was free! I",
          "Beautiful and historic portion of history. Henry V!!! considered a great monarch for all reformations. Debated by some however. The restaurant is a pleasant surprise for visitors especially those who want to mingle with government officials of Aragon. Nice place to visit",
          "It is astonishing how well this building has been rebuilt and it looks like it is well used by the local government, a guarantee that it is going to survive and remind us of the great Moorish heritage of Spain. Built in the second half of the 11th century as a residence for the",
          "The areas I could visit was small, but beautiful. In December it was a quiet visit, which I preferred.",
          "A palace that deserves to visit with guides to give you information about the history of the places and especially about those who lived here. Architecture is impressed and the way it was restored makes the beauty of this castle even more valuable. The 3 palaces inside bear you",
          "The palace is awesome. Very beautiful buildings. Lots of history. - But the only offered a guided your in spanish. - we meet a very agressive guard. Not good on a tourist attraction But no matter What. You have to visit the palace",
          "Outside the Roman walls, in the plain of the Sar\u00eda or place where the Muslims developed the military fanfare known as La Almozara..",
          "the most extensive and marvellous arab building in the north od Spain with additions dating to various periods. A good audioguide is available and it is a must.",
          "Went there for a quick visit and we were suggested to choose the guided tour. What a nice surprise! Undoubtedly is a gorgeous palace but, we wouldn't have taken that much we did without the guide. And yes! You will see 4 palaces in one",
          "Palacio de la Aljaferia is a miniature replica of the Palace Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Open daily 10 am - 2 pm and 4 30 pm - 8 pm. Fee 5 euros. Sunday is free. Free parking is available. Duration of visit approx. 1,5 hours self-guided tour with English booklet. The Palace is",
          "The exterior is impressive but the architecture inside is amazing. Not far from the city center. A very walkable distance actually down one of the main streets. Very affordable as well, I believe it was 4 euros. Time it appropriately since they were closed from 14:00 to 16:00 on",
          "Getting to the Alifaria (and other central sites) was a breeze from the Zaragoza train station, thanks to the very visible tourist information board, manned by a very informative, fluent English-speaking young woman who proceeded to tell us enthusiastically about the attractions",
          "Palacio de la Aljaferia is bit outside the very centre, so we decided to make a stop before departure from Zaragoza. 1,5 hour visit was enough to see this remarkable place. There was much more to see than we expected, the interior design is really nice example of Moorish",
          "Well worth visiting this stunning palace. Beautifully kept and very interesting. Architecture, ceilings and rooms a delight to see",
          "I like the outlook of the palace. It is still in a good condition and currently serves as parliament. I didnot like the cars parked along the walls, they somehow not in line with ithe historical sense of the palace. Worth to visit.",
          "The palace is an excellent example of Moorish architecture. The outside appears to be in very good condition but much of the inside decorations have faded or been destroyed. Still, there is enough to see to make it interesting. The audio guide is a bit dry but gives really good",
          "This is a lovely building with lots of things to see. With some lovely ceiling decorations and architecture.",
          "I'm a big fan of ancient architecture so Zaragoza does it for me at almost every turn. An easy walk from our hotel and it was the focal point of several of our walks around the city.",
          "From the exterior, the Palace reveals little of the beautiful Moorish architectural gems is hides and wonderfully restored pained ceilings. We visited on Sunday when it is free entry. Today the palace is the seat of parliament for Zaragoza and the department of Aragon and has",
          "Even considering is not in the very center, it is worth a visit. If it's ok with your schedule I think sundays they have free entrance, and the place is kind of magical. A real ancient castle in perfect condition, that allows your imagination fly, ok, is not the Alhambra in",
          "The old palace has been beautifully restored on its grand location. Many of the original features have been lost but the arches and ceilings are lovely.",
          "The fortress is large, but there is not much left inside except for the painted & carved ceilings. Most of the interior furnishings, etc., that you can see are actually in the gallery of photos from other moorish forts.",
          "Another stunning find in Zaragoza - a beautiful 'summer' castle, opulently designed and beautifully maintained. Houses the current regional parliament also!",
          "If you ignore the slightly brusque security and sporadic signage (Aljafer\u00eda is also the Aragonese Parliament) then this a real gem. Sadly stuck in amongst some of Zaragoza\u2019s ugliest housing projects, you can nevertheless appreciate the setting of this turn of the (last)",
          "Free on Sundays which was an unexpected bonus! And English audio guides only 3 euros. Long queues to get in but fabulous inside. Very, very beautiful and such varied/interesting history. Well worth a visit.",
          "Even though I knew a bit about the castle from friends recommendation, I was unprepared for what I saw inside. A lot of it has been reconstructed but it's a great example of the moorish influence on Spanish architecture and reminded me in some ways of parts of the Alhambra and",
          "It's easy to see why this was the king's pleasure palace. It has been heavily renovated to house the current government,but the parts that remain are beautiful. I especially enjoyed the garden courtyard. One to 1.5 hours are definitely enough to see it.",
          "We tried to go but we were unable to visit due to parliament being in session. Hours are limited to afternoons on Thursdays and Fridays April thru October. Looks like a very interesting place to visit.",
          "Having read about the palace we decided to visit on our first day, and spent a couple of hours exploring. The combination of moorish and medieval architecture was fantastic, and the information sheets in some rooms were really helpful as we didn't buy the audioguide. Fantastic",
          "Worth a visit but will probably not need more than an hour. The location is rather surprising (and slightly depressing) as it is surrounded by modern apartment blocks, shops etc, but inside it is interesting and attractive. You won't need more than an hour but be aware that it",
          "We, unfortunately, only had a short time to spend in Zaragoza, this should definitely be at least a three day stopover. As it was, our visit to Aljaferia was too short. This late eleventh century Islamic Palace currently houses the Cortes, the regional parliament of the",
          "The palace, mightily impressive from outside, sits in an unlikely neighbourhood, with apartment blocks opposite, and doesn't seem raised up enough to be imposing, yet it sits there dominating your vision. Entrance fee was surprisingly moderate and once inside we had the run of",
          "Currently used as the regional government assembly but the main building to available to walk around at leisure. Moorish architecture is well preserved as well as later additions. Spanish history in one building.",
          "Really it's amazing palace it was built by muslim the king name is Abu Jaafar Ahmed Al Muqtadir it's fort",
          "Beautiful architecture (the palace has been rebuilt several times during different eras). Lovely ceilings and columned spaces.",
          "The palace is nice, well maintained. Big and with good exhibits. It's a real shame they have only a few audio guides, no guiding in English and all the exhibits have Spanish only instructions. They have an app to download but it crashed. In any case - nice place to visit. Only",
          "We went around the Aljaferia on our own so I think we may have missed some of the points of interest. It reminded me of the Alhambra (and also some of the Indian palaces. There wasn't as much to see as I had thought and the staff were not very helpful.",
          "This is a must for any visitor to Zaragoza. Go on the English Tour every night at 5pm. The guide was great and we visit all the areas from the old Moorish rooms through to the Christian era and finishing off visiting the Chamber of the Parliament of Aragon. It was great",
          "beautiful building, a must to be visited, but check the website for visitinghours to avoid disappointment",
          "One of the few places to rival Granada in its blend of Moorish and Spanish architecture. A real gem.",
          "Had a lovely moorish square very similar to parts of La Alhambra in Granada but not much else. The indoor museum part is a bit plain and didn't last long. Expect the whole visit to last about an hour",
          "About a 15 minute walk from the central area, it's well worth visiting. A beautiful restoration with stunning old carving. How did they do that with lasers? Be careful about opening hours as it's a functioning local government building still.",
          "I was a bit dissappointed by the Aljaferia and had expected more large patios with mosaic floors. There were some beautiful rooms and spaces to see, but I felt like in 45 minutes I had seen it all. The architecture is very beautiful though. There was limited infomation",
          "This building defines the city as it is visible from a long way. As you drive into the city this is what you notice most. As others have said the inside is even more amazing and well worth a visit.",
          "Breathtaking palace that clearly shows what great cultures the Spanish and Islamic are. Amazingly restored keeping the original impact and details intact. We took the tour included with the ticket. Nicely paced and great guide.",
          "very impressive building we walked around the palace at sunset and it was very beautiful. only 5 to 10 minute walk from the city",
          "This castle / palace marvelously illustrate the mighty achievements of the Islamic era in Spain. It\u2019s architecture is breathtaking! Once you are inside you realize how gorgeous history is. It is a building that narrates an era of glory and diversity.",
          "Really stunning architecture at this 11th century palace. The carving and painted ceilings are really stunning. The central courtyard is so peaceful. It's \u20ac5 for adults but kids cost only \u20ac1.",
          "The tour guide provides a good summary of the history of the palace as well as information on the stonework. The interior work is quite impressive. Since it is also an government office only about half of the castle are accessible. Take the free tour first and then go back and",
          "Aljaferia - as it is described is a must see. It combines so many elements of history from Arab history, Spanish inquisition and finally to modern day Parliament. We had the benefit of an excellent guide, Rebecca who provided a great background to the property. It turned out",
          "The Muslim style of the architecture is amazing, this is definitely a place to visit in Zaragoza. Plus, it's so cheap, between 1 and 2 hours should be sufficient to go around. If you're lucky, it's also common to see a wedding photo session.",
          "Very Under sold as most things in this town as tourism has barely kissed the place. This palace has history in abundance. It's pretty difficult to work out what is where and there is very little translation from Spanish. You can get a guided tour. The audio guide was Q reader",
          "We loved this historic site! It has beautiful arab artwork on ceilings and walls. We did the guided tour and found it really interesting. Highly recommend it!",
          "I loved the openness and the overall feel of this place - the detail in the designs was spectacular and certainly impressed. I walked from the town centre on a hot day in about 20 mins.",
          "The Aljaferia is so much smaller compared to the Alhambra in Granada but it nevertheless allows the visitor a glimpse of Muslim architecture at its finest. It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "We didn't know a lot about the Palacio before we arrived, but hit was fascinating the way it reflects the different occupiers of the region.",
          "The Islamic medieval palace offers a good flavor of the Arabic influence in the area dating back 11th century providing its visitors with rich historical data.",
          "I found this the most interesting sight in Zaragoza. The Moorish architecture is beautiful and the displays were well set out.",
          "Sometimes, you see so many castles in Europe that they all start to look the same. This one shows lots of great contrasts from the Moors and the Catholic influences. Bonus points too that it's an active seat of government.",
          "Visited this palacio during one day tour to Zaragoza. Palace was made by Muslim rulers so have that style.of. very nice garden than a ditch for protection and palace.all made of.stones. it is just in between the city nice pathway that leads you to main door circumference and",
          "As a geeky archaeologist I suppose I was expecting more Islamic ruins - what we actually have here is a well restored office building with some interesting exhibition space. Good but not excellent for a none Spanish speaker, we wandered around in about an hour and a half.",
          "The Aljafer\u00eda Palace (Palacio de la Aljaferia) is an impressive medieval Islamic palace (and fort). There was plenty of parking in a dirt lot behind the palace, which also serves the adjacent park. It was a short walk to the front entrance. Travel sites don\u2019t seem to lavish",
          "Was able to tour this palace on a recent trip through Zaragoza. I would definitely recommend viewing this palace.",
          "A little jewel to visit. An old summer residence built in the XI century by Jaafar the king of the Muslim kingdom. Magnificent remnants, splendid architecture and a wonderful restoration. It holds the present Aragon parliament but a visit will allow you to walk through",
          "The massive fortress is well preserved and inside is the palace. The beautiful colonnades and gardens show the original Moorish construction and a lot of work has been done to restore the design features that could be found. There are many ornate columns and archways and the",
          "It is a beautiful palace! I was expecting less based on what I had heard, so it was a nice surprise!",
          "What an amazing old castle. It is well worth seeing. Spend about an hour going through all the rooms which have some amazing ceilings. You can see the etchings where the french prisoners were kept during the war. Take the time to stroll aound the entire building in the mote",
          "It is a very nice castle with a museum and the local government of Aragon which uses the venue to hold sessions. Discover the mourish past of Zaragoza and archtectural highlights in the nicely renovated complex. Bus stop in front of the castle.",
          "The old Roman city of Caesar Augusta received an impulse during the Muslim rule of the Banu Qasi (sons of Casius). Te old fortress was rebuilt and excellent Islamic art was added. The Aragonese conquest at the beginning of the 12th c. kept most of the palace, including the small",
          "We have spent 2-3 hours discovering the palace. The palace was in a very bad condition and the restoration made significant improvements. We enjoyed both inside and outside of the palace. It both shows early Islamic motives and Spanish influence.",
          "A must see if you go to Zaragoza. Get the audioguide. It is a mixture of Muslim and Christian influences, well restored, with beautiful ceilings and floors.",
          "I was totally disappointed because the only day I was in Zaragoza, the parliament met in this palace and it was therefore close to the public.",
          "Maybe we've seen too much but the Palacios de la Aljaferia was underwhelming. Nice to wander around but is put in the shade by the Palacio Real in Seville and the Alhambra in Granada. That could be a bit harsh but we did leave thinking OK but.... Sorry.",
          "Highly recommended. For students it costs only 1\u20ac to visit is (5\u20ac adults). Wonderful site with nice architecture. Very friendly staff. Possibility to take pictures everywhere.",
          "There is not a lot to say about this Palacio which hasn't been said before. It is packed full of history from the Moors, to Ferdinand and Isabella, and it even has the tower which is the setting of Verdi's opera \"Il Trovatore\". The architecture is beautiful, as are the ceilings,",
          "Highly recommended...beautiful inside and out. Our guide was great! Kids enjoyed the visit...the guide engaged them. Plan to be there for 45 minutes. We walked from downtown. No need to take a taxi or bus.",
          "Having visited Peterborough cathedral in England to see where Henry VIII's first wife Catherine of Aragon is buried. During our visit to Zaragoza we had to visit Palacio de la Aljaferia where Catherine was born and grew up. The mixture of Islamic and Christian architecture is",
          "But not a lot to see inside. look up: the ceilings are the best part. I went on Sunday when it was free. Otherwise barely worth \u20ac5",
          "For 5 euros, you can either take a self guided or group tour of the palace. I did a group tour in Spanish (I'm not sure if English is available) and the guide was knowledgeable and friendly. There are some neat works of art to see, but much of the building has been renovated",
          "The Palace is outwith the \"Old City\", but as it was a nice day we decided to walk, and took the advantage to see the outer city, and a few spectacular new buildings en-route. From the outside, the structure looks more like a castle or fort, and the entrance is over a ( now) dry",
          "Entry costs 5 euro and you get guided tour included. The tour was in Spanish but very informative and interesting told. Amazing mixture of Arab style and maintained medieval ceiling.",
          "So this Palace is an amazing work of art and discovery, there are many breathtaking sites within this palace including beautiful works of Art, amazing detail on the walls and arch ways, beautiful ceilings that will make you gasp, as well as a beautiful garden at a very cheap and",
          "The palace was first the residence of the Arabic kings during the Taifas' period; then hosted the Christian kings during the Crown of Aragon period; Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabel of Castilla, the Catholic kinks, also spent time there... All of them left their mark in this",
          "If you don't have the opportunity to travel to Cordoba, Granada, or Sevilla and want to see some great Moorish architecture, visit the Aljaferia. There are several impressive courtyards that give you a sense of the impact of the Moors on Spain. It can be reached from the old",
          "Mud\u00e9jar. It's such a special word, and derives from the Arabic, meaning literally, 'a remainer'. It refers to the muslim descendants of the north-African kingdoms in Spain that opted to remain after the 12th-century Christian conquests (remember El Cid?) - but in these uncertain",
          "This place looks impressive from the outside and has a lot to see inside. Pick up an audio guide to help you understand what you are viewing and then just follow the signs which will take you on a tour of the place.",
          "From the outside the Palacio is very impressive. It is about a 25 minute walk from the Old Town. It may be our own fault as we did not book a tour but after a few explanations, in English, on the ground floor there were no further translations which made our understanding of",
          "Fine (but reconstructed) moorish arches, and some later medieval history. Free on Sundays, though the crowds were a bit much.",
          "This Palace must have been let go to ruin because not much was left of it but you still get the feel of what it was like",
          "Situated just a little outside the historic city centre the Palacio is an interesting visit. Perhaps slightly over restored it is nonetheless full of rich decoration. The Moorish parts have finely detailed arches and a exhibition room explains the iconography of the carvings.",
          "This palace/fortress is a 20 or so minute walk from the main attractions but definitely worth it . The \u20ac5pp entrance fee is good value to see a beautifully restored palace. A good time to visit is at lunchtime because the cafeteria serve a fantastic \u20ac8.80 meal which includes a",
          "One of a must places to visit when you're in Zaragoza. Love the mix design. Especially the (used to be) muslim prayer room",
          "Had to queue for several minutes to obtain the free tickets (every Sunday entrance is free). There are excellent explanations in English. Allow at least two hours.",
          "nice Moorish castle, worth the visit. had guided tour in Spanish and learned a lot about this historic monument. looks a bit like the Alhambra (in Granada) only smaller.",
          "Visited at opening time (10.00 am) and had most of the rooms to ourselves. There are audio guides available but we managed with the information cards (many languages) that are available in each of the main areas. The restoration that has been carried out to much of the",
          "We went on a Sunday, which is free entrance. It's a must see while in Zaragoza. It can get a bit busy on Sundays because of this, but totally worth it",
          "From the outside the great palace is relatively attractive. Once we pass the entrance, we quickly reach the Arabic courtyard with orange trees. Very pleasant but lacking the charm of the Arab palaces of Andaluc\u00eda. Everything is a bit rougher and there is not much to see. Passed",
          "I went on Sunday morning and I was surprised to discover my visit and the guided tour were both free. I forgot to write down the name of the guide, but I think it was Teresa. She was great. Super knowledgeable and had an engaging way of presenting the information. I learned",
          "It's definitely no Alhambra but it's alright to pass half an hour there. I found the security guards very officious and \"on top of you\". Made going round a little pressured.",
          "This is a must see in Zaragoza. We spent a few hours wondering around the well preserved palace admiring the architecture and history.",
          "Really pretty, and only one euro for students! Really worth the visit! Make sure to make reservations for the tour... really worth visiting",
          "A beautiful mix of Moorish and Christian architecture. The palace is well preserved and offers many intricate examples of Islamic architectural elements. The arched doors and decorations featuring complex geometrical patterns make for an interesting visit. Besides what you can",
          "It is so surprising to find such a place in Saragossa. You could think of being in Granada, Seville or Cordoba... or in North Africa. This beautiful palace is comprised of moorish and gothic elements and really deserves a visit because of its beauty and its historical",
          "We walked to El Aljaferia from central Zaragoza ( about 15 - 20 minutes) arriving even before it opened. Entrance price was 5 Euros but only 1 Euro for seniors so this was a real bargain. We had a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable tour guide who explained things very well",
          "lovely palace packed with history really enjoyed our visit and make sure you get the headset guide from the shop",
          "Impressive from outside yes, but even more so from inside. Wander the halls and study the complexities of its design (will keep you busy for quite a while) or just sit on a bench and enjoy the open spaces. Also stroll around in the gardens outside, as there are some nice places",
          "This was my favorite site in the city. It has been preserved with great care and it is still ongoing. The architectural details are really quite beautiful and they have done an excellent job with the restoration. It is a little bit of a walk from the center of town, but I would",
          "The Palace was the seat of Muslim rule in teh Aragon area for centuroes, and even after the Reconquista, the Christian rulers of Aragon kept strng ties with teh Muslim and Jewish populations, maing this a very strong symbol of early interfaith cooperation and harmony (ended with",

          "The building has been restored to reflect the original Islamic palace of the 11th century. The beautiful ceilings and wonderfully carved arches, doorways and passageways are a must see. Plan to spend at least an hour and a half just exploring.",
          "A magnificent testament to the Moors understanding of sustainable and beautiful building. The weather was very hot, but in the Palacio de la Aljaferia it was much cooler. The carvings of the arches and careful consideration of layout and the beautiful restoration, with",
          "A visit to this beautiful place is a must. Just a 15 minute walk from the Plaza Pilar. Very beautiful reminder of Spain's Moorish influences",
          "Best tourist site in Zaragoza. Really beautiful. I especially enjoyed the guide. Seems much smaller than La Alhambra but worth it.",
          "If you tell the guide that you don't speak Spanish he will make an effort to translate the highlights for you. Also following the tour makes it best to see all the different rooms, and attractions. LOTS of steps but there elevators and lifts just ask for their location. A coffee",
          "We arrived around 10:30 on a Saturday. There were three other tour groups in with us. We were always maneuvering to stay out of their way. The building itself was very interesting, and definitely a great price. It's only 1 euro for students. It's a bit out of the old town,",
          "Those who visited Alhambra really recommended to compare and admire!!! No gardens but architecture and indoor structure are outstanding!",
          "Impressive intricate designs from doorways to wooden ceiling to archways. Good craftsmanship . The place is so well conserved and maintained",
          "Beautifully restored castle in the heart of Zaragoza with perfectly restored moorish (Mujedar) architecture - UNESCO world heritage site since 2001. Home of the Regional Assembly of Aragon. Contains rooms introduced bu the Christina 'Re-conquerors'. \u20ac5 per adult entrance in",
          "They have done (and are still continuing) an amazing restoration process here. It's similar to some of the better known sites in the south of Spain except for more extensive additions by the Catholic Monarchs. Plus, it is smaller and can easily be experienced in about 1 1/2",
          "It's mandatory to visit if you come to Zaragoza. Related to the Catholic Kings who discovered America.",
          "This beautiful fortified Islamic Palace, is very well preserved. Inside you can enjoy the central garden, the original and gorgeous decorated coffered ceilings aswell as Al-Andalus and Aragon's History.",
          "A must see if you visit Zaragoza, wonderful architecture, full of old Spanish History . Smaller version on the palace in Granda in southern Spain.",
          "This is an amazing place! First you have the 11th century Moorish palace with the Mujhedar architecture. The delicacy of the arches, the water garden, and the rooms that date from the Crusades are all prime attractions to this site. But, add the Palacios de las Reyes Catolicos",
          "A beautiful palace with a mixture of Muslim and Christian influences. Its located near the river but be careful if you want to go to the gift shop I walked passed it a few times without realising it was there. An added bonus is that its free on Sundays.",
          "I'm very happy we took the time to visit here, although we were pressed for time so didn't take the audio tour. I would have liked to learn more about the building and its history.",
          "There is so much history here. What a gem. A must see in Zaragoza. Check opening times as closed part of Thurdays and Fridays. Only 5 euro entry fee and well worth adding to your itinerary",
          "An interesting palace, with some really good ceilings and rooms. Been well restored. On Sundays it is free to visit, always a bonus.",
          "Little known jewel of arab arquitecture in Spain. Must visit if you are in Zaragoza. It is a bit far from the main monuments but it is worth the trip.",
          "We did not manage to visit the museum since it is opened only after 4:30 p.m. after office hours of local parliament . One should have it in mind when planning the visit",
          "Beautiful garden forecourt and impressive royal halls, especially the well preserved ceilings are worth seeing. This palace is a unique example of Arab influence in Spain",
          "So glad this place has been kept and preserved. How beautiful. The intricate work of its architecture similar to the Alcazar in Sevilla in some way. Beautiful rooms and arches and gardens. The entry fee was only 5 euro, a great price and the visit is good if you have an hour or",
          "This was recommended by the helpful young woman at the thrust center but we didn't know it was so special. Unique architecture and a history that parallels that of Spain in a vivid way. Really a treasure.",
          "Worth doing. Interesting history; really good resoration and some Moorish decor. Make sure you get the audio guide to get additional information and detail. Would also suggest visiting early on in the day - we were there for 11:00 and it was quite quiet, but by the time we",
          "A really interesting place, well-documented for visitors, and with a huge variety of architectural styles, tracing Zaragoza's history over the centuries. A bit off the central beat but absolutely worth the effort to get to.",
          "My friends and I had an overnight stay in Zaragoza and just managed to fit a trip in to see this wonderful building. The history was very interesting and the architecture, although extensively restored, is lovely. The admission price of 5 euros is v inexpensive and it is well",
          "Quite cheap to visit and a pretty place to wander about in. Lovely courtyard and a nice route around inside. If you like ornate architecture, then this will float your boat. We spent about 1hour walking around (some people whizzed round, others seemed rooted to one spot -",
          "My fianc\u00e9, niece and I visited the palace yesterday and we were disappointed of it. Almost the whole palace was restored. We could barely see the palace because most of the rooms were closed to the visitors. The only thing they kept were the ceilings. There are two little modern",
          "Well worth the trouble of walking a little. Buses also available. Heavily restored but tastefully done. Very very interesting.",
          "I expected a very old and ancient monument, but as it is using as a political parliament, you can only see a few part of the old building, however the way they are conserving it is appreciated",
          "The English language tour guide told us we would be \"very tired\" as we would be covering a thousand years of history in one hour. Not a bad description of what followed. The Moorish architecture is really interesting but the Catholic royal rooms are mostly unfurnished so they",
          "The place is nice and historical but it has been renovated and now it looks like it lacks soul. Still good to visit but a bit disapointing.",
          "This is something that you should not miss. Moorish architecture is such a pleasure and we are lucky that a good part of it is still intact. The building is dual purpose today one part is for viewing whilst the other is used by the local government.",
          "Home to the king's of aragon for 500 years. Beautifully restored. Wonderful court yards. No queuing. 5\u20ac for adults, free for children. Parking nearby, can be tricky to find but is available. GO!",
          "We did the free guided tour in English edit was very interesting and informative with just the right amount of detail. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is an 11th century Moorish castle with unique architecture later converted into a palace for the kings of Aragon. It currently serves as the home for the state parliament. Good tour guide provided by the facility with a 1-1/2 hour walk through the centuries!",
          "It is really beautifull castle, inside you can find mudejar style. Mudejar style you can find just in Spain.",
          "We walked across town to 'experience' the streets and also get a feel for Zaragoza. I did laugh at the other TRIPADVISOR comments about the heat and the 'relief' from the sun..on previous comments. It was so windy tonight we had to wear/carry jumpers and consider a third layer.",
          "A pleasant visit for the price. A \u20ac5 adult entry fee (less for students and children) is worth the trip. The building is spectacular inside and outside, though as mentioned previously there is not much to see given the history of the building which you can learn about using the",
          "An impressive former palace now used as a regional government assembly. The building is worth a visit if only to escape the heat on a blistering early evening. If you want to know more about Catalan history, speak Spanish and are into Moorish architecture it's a must. If not,",
          "I visited the fort during my last stay in Zaragoza there was no time for it this time around but this place is always worth a visit... amazing architecture amazing history so if you come to this city this is a must-see!",
          "Well from outside this looks really impressive but once you enter you have to consider the history of the place. Much has been lost over the years as it has been used as a barracks, prison, left unused and ransacked so unfortunately much of the decoration is now lost and you",
          "There's a reason this is a UNESCO site, go see it! Not only does it having amazing history and aesthetic value, it's also the current seat of the government. Tons of guides available, and even in peak tourist season it wasn't crowded.",
          "Very nice palace.... You need guidance to explain the history of this palace The entrance fee is cheap It is interesting to walk",
          "We've booked online ahead of time and, we were lucky as they only gave tours to those whom booked early. We had a tour guide to go through the Palace with us and it has a lot of Moorish influence for the architecture, well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful building showcasing islamic architecture. Beware however that they close during siesta hours.",
          "On paper and judging the perfect preservation, the Palacio looks like a castle/fortress on par with Milan's. Sadly, it doesn't come close. The visit started off great, with entry to the courtyard full of beautiful plants and Moorish designs. In fact, the carved stone above",
          "Moorish and Christian architecture all together in the same building. Good information on site. Do not miss this place if you have any interest in Spanish history.",
          "Great little fortress that has been renovated and looks quite good. Now this is no Alcazar in Seville or Alhambra in Granada however it does show off some Moorish architecture and has its own style. It has nice fortified walls and turrets and a deep brick wide moat and all very",
          "This isn't anything like the more famous Moorish places in Andaluc\u00eda, but nevertheless worth a visit for an hour or so. It's only a 20 minute walk from the main tourist areas.",
          "Zaragoza is a rather small, bike friendly city and this is one of several places we visited on an afternoon bike ride. According to a local, this Palacio is where King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella gave Christopher Columbus the money for his three ships. The building is",
          "As with everywhere you have to make sure of the opening times - become Spanish in your thinking about visits. Again do not Miss this. 1 euro for seniors and the audio guide is 3 euros but well worth it.",
          "Very disappointing. Empty rooms! A shame after walking 1.5 miles from the wonderful cathedral in the heat. Closes between 2pm and 5 pm for siesta.",
          "Glad I took the time to go - beautiful angles and I'm sure the history is fascinating - but I treated the experience totally as a visual event. I got there 45 minutes before afternoon closing and felt that it was worth the 'Rush' through. Definitely worth a visit while in",
          "An unexpected summer palace in Zaragoza. A city to be discovered. Beautiful restoration, evocative rooms and garden. Beautifully fresh under the heat of the day. An entertaining piece of history",
          "We have been to Granada and Cordoba, but were still impressed by this palace and the fact of how far north the Moors came.",
          "Well worth a visit to better appreciate Spanish history. Well preserved with good informative pamphlet.",
          "Well worth the visit. It currently houses the Cortes of Aragon - the regional parliament. They've undertaken a very sympathetic and careful restoration, and provide guides in a variety of languages.",
          "pretty steep entry fee. on the other side of town from other Zaragoza sights. can miss. okay for a visit if spending a night in the city.",
          "An easy 15 minute walk from most of Zaragoza,surrounded by the park,it is a smaller version of Granada Palace but has a certain amount of charm.At only 1 euro for a pensioner over 65 and 5 euros normaly I call that a bargain.",
          "Beautiful and so interesting to read about the Moorish influence in Zaragoza. Don't miss this, it truly is amazing to see the original palace, courtyard and the history.",
          "A must see if you are in Zaragoza, is the Aljaferia. It is not like the great buildings in Seville or Spain but the mosaics, wood work and gardens are well worth the visit and a great way to spend 3 hours.",
          "Nice to see the Islamic influence in Northern Spain, but if you want the real thing, better head South",
          "its better to visit with a guide, this palace its not big but has many stories to tell and I think book guide its describing it very general .you can get there with a bus from the center. its one of the best atraction in Zaragoza",
          "Full of surprises & much to discover within the walls of this historical beauty. Will leave my pictures to convince you it's definitely worth visiting to discover what once went on behind the walls.",
          "Located at the edge of the old town this riverside castle (now housing a courthouse) provides a nice tour of this mixed-style castle at the former edge of the Muslim world in Spain.",
          "Fine to see from the outside, imposing castle type building but once inside...what a discovery! Beautiful Moorish-Christian architecture found more often in the South of Spain. I love surprises, and this was a wonderful surprise. A must for those who visit Zaragoza!",
          "A bit off the beaten track, the Palacio is well restored and put to modern use as a legislature. Can be done in 30 minutes.",
          "It was a pleasant 2 km morning walk stopping at Eglisa San Pedro along the way. Pictures at 10AM opening are superb with the crowds arriving as we exited an hour later. This fortress/castle is a must visit for culture and architecture buffs.",
          "We went to the Aljaferia with few expectations but were amazed at just how beautiful the place is. Very reminiscent of the Alhambra in Granada. Senior citizens gain entry for only one euro! The meals offered in the excellent restaurant are fantastic value. Two choices of menu",
          "Very interesting place, a mix of moor and catholic history in the same building, that at the end got mixed and become very beautiful, 2 cultures reflected at the same space",
          "A cultural melting pot in itself, the Aljaferia is an absolute must in Saragossa. Entry was and the excellent guided tour too was for free.",
          "This was the main attraction for us to visit Zaragoza. This Palace is an exquisite example of a medieval Islamic Palace built in the 11th Century. It later became the seat of the Christian Kings of Aragon. If you love the Islamic architecture this is the place to see. Not",
          "This castle were a muslim site for wall decorations construction. Is big and with stairs to climb. Have 5 stories and a center patio. Well maintenace and clean. Don't take to much time fo see it.",
          "You can go and see the courtyard without a ticket. The courtyard is kind of interesting, however the rest of this palace is not. Just a dull amalgamation of rooms with not much in it. Only in three rooms you will see noteworthy ceilings. There are better things to see and do in",
          "On Sunday got free entrance into this charming castle-palace where you can see moorish influence in many details.",
          "One of the most impressive Moorish buildings in all Spain, built in the 11th century, used as a residence to the royal family in the past, now the home of the parliament of Aragon, one of the top places to visit whilst in Zaragoza",
          "nice place, very well preserved. the visit was very pleasant but it's kind of small-ish... the whole visit took us about half an hour (+ a short presentation movie)",
          "This really is a great visit especially in the morning, you get the place almost to yourself. No, it's no Alhambra - but if I was going to be disappointed with every beach that isn't the great barrier reef, I'd never leave Australia! The simplicity is brilliant and loved the",
          "With a few hours to spend in Zaragosa we decided to walk along the river to see the Palacio de la Aljaferia. It was a pleasant stroll along the river and we were delighted that we made the effort to see what turned out to be a most interesting mix of old and new architecture",
          "Especially if one is not acquainted with Moorish architecture the Palacio de la Aljaferia is certainly worth seeing. It has a handsome pillar hall that opens to a planted courtyard. One can also have a look into a small prayer room with an attractive decor. However, beyond that",
          "Not only the historic, artistic and architectonic importance, but also the presentation and visitor friendliness is very well worth a visit of this palace which has been built by the emperors of the islamic Taifa kingdoms 1000 years ago, then habilitated at the needs and stile",
          "One should not expect a palace with great ornamentation. It is a well maintained ancient palace. The trenches and towers speak of the great history it has.",
          "Plaza del Pilar with river Ebro at back is really huge and nice and church too, and Palacio de Aljaferia is well maintained",
          "great tour guide & amazing structure - chilling to think about who has also walked the same halls over the past several hundred years",
          "Totally opposite in style and substance to the Basilica, this palace built many centuries earlier is a perfect example of Moorish design that treats the visitor to natural light. A very wonderful story behind its construction and history.",
          "Really enjoyable. Signs all in Spanish but information cards in English and other languages which explain the key information. Easy walk from old town.",
          "Great bit of history and exciting place to spend an hour. Jafar (from Aladdin)'s palace, where the famous Gold Room used to be. The Moorish garden is pretty much a reconstruction, but it's evocative and atmospheric, along with the remnants of Jafar's summer palace. The main",
          "I will definitely be revisiting this moorish palace and taking advantage of the audio guide to gain a better appreciation of its rich history. From the brief visit which I had on this trip, I am very keen to learn more.",
          "Having g visited Granada and Sevikle although you can see the architecture it ain't worth visiting In Zaragoza. Small garden and that's it!",
          "The architectural work of this palace is amazing! It's history through the ages is also very interesting and the influence of the different ages is evident. Coming from Canada, where we have nothing either this old or this splendid, I found this place to be marvelous.",
          "Beautiful moorish palace, unfortunately most of it was closed due to renovation. But I didn't have to pay because of that. Definitely worth a visit once you can see it all, and I'll definitely be back to do so :)",
          "This is a gem. The palace was originally built by Arab rulers in the XIth century as a summer residence (quite a summer house...). In 1118 the Aragon king conquered the Muslims and took over the palace. It has since been altered and repaired in several stages, but much of the",
          "This building has strong eastern influenced architectural detail that is breath taking. Lovely exhibitions and stunning gardens. Good food on site.",
          "Not as impressive as the Alcaz\u00e1r in Seville, but still a beautiful place with an interesting history. If you understand Spanish, I advise the guided tour (don't know whether it's available in English), it's included in the small (\u20ac5) entrance fee.",
          "Currently serving as the Parliament building for the Autonomous Region of Aragon, this fortress palace was built by the Moors centuries ago. It is beautifully detailed inside and out, and is definitely worth a trip if you're in town. Although, they don't let you take many photos",
          "For me it was the highlight of our short stay in Zaragoza. Got there at the second attempt, went firstly Friday morning only to find that it was group bookings only, so came back when it opened again in the afternoon (like most attractions in Zaragoza, it closes between midday",
          "Although it was a little bit out of the way we walked from la Basilica del Pilar to the Aljaferia. We walked to it by the beautiful Ebro riverside. The Palace of Aljaferia was built in the Middle Ages by a moorish king and later on after the conquest it was inhabited by",
          "I spent six weeks in Spain but this was my favourite day visiting Palacio de la Aljaferia. The beautiful Moorish architecture is stunning and it's easy to wander about the grounds and buildings to take in the atmosphere. I don't know why but there were not many tourists there",
          "Nice place to visit, there are nice room and interesting things to see. There is also the student discount.",
          "Very interesting building, especially if you like the mudejar style. Lots to see and do around it. Take your time.",
          "My wife and I first thought that this is a small place with lots of offices, restricted areas. But we were wrong. This place brought you to journey through many centuries of rich cultures and arts!",
          "Not the biggest or most well decorated palace in the world, but still beautiful in its own right. I got an audio guide, but that is not very necessary as they have information sheets at all the important points. 5 Euros to enter.",
          "One of the nicests visits in Zaragoza, a must! The arabic and mudejar (hispanoarabic) parts are the most beautiful",
          "Took photos from outside not even find out if entrance if possible. Along the way could see few nice building. Very quiet in afternoon 4pm from a 20mins walk from Jamie 1. Not sure entrance and interior is real good.",
          "Very well maintained. Not sure if there are tours in English. Also used now as provincial legislature. Beautiful rooms from era of Ferdinand and Isabel",
          "We visited this palace on a Sunday morning and because it was the first Sunday of the month were very pleasantly surprised to find that it was free to enter. The architecture is beautiful and even though there were lots of people there it still seemed very peaceful.",
          "I really admired this Palacio, it really shows the touch of the Islamic culture; so big plan at least 2 hours to see the different parts and rooms of the castle, I believe it a must visit while staying in Zaragosa. it costs 5 euros for the ticket, but late I heard that the entry",
          "Massive castle now partly used as the Aragon Parliament. You can visit de interior court and the partly islamic partly gothic building styles (and of course the famous tower where Il Trovatore was imprisoned, or so the story goes).",
          "If somebody doesn't have a chance to visit any of the great monuments of the moorish architecture in Andalucia, Aljaferia is a nice digest. I recommend having a look inside, especially on Sundays, when it's free",
          "I now have a (small) regret in my life: I didn't visit Spain earlier in my traveling life when my strength, stamina and curiosity could pace one another through its cities and towns. Italy never suffered the destruction wrought by the Moors who invaded Spain in the 8th to 11th",
          "This is worth the trip all the way from Madrid. Be careful with their hours. They close for siesta and you need at least 2 hours in the building. Audio guide is super informative. From the massive moat to the intricate carvings to the garden, it is a site to behold.",
          "If you have been to the other Alcazars and palaces in Spain, it is not a must. Also, the hours are odd, closed middle of the day.",
          "This proved to be a highlight of our visit to Zaragoza and quite unexpected. It is a lovely old palace dating back to Moorish times and has all the beauty you would expect of that era. You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours there enjoying the very well,presented history of the palace.",
          "The Moors left their mark on Zaragoza. This is a fabulous palace that has some very nice moorish features. It is a must see. Note that on Sundays it is free and if you are a visitor from away, just tell them and it is also free.",
          "Just another excellent piece of Arab heritage in Spain. It shows the best heritage we could keep from the ancient times we were conquered by the arabs. The gardens show similarity to the Aljaferia ones in Andalusia. Similar construction and amazing history. Perfect location",
          "This is a great place to visit and a must see destination when in Zaragoza. The palace has undergone considerable renovations however traces of glorious past where everywhere, from wooden ceilings and painted walls to intrinsic wall mosaics. Combinations between these elements",
          "The Palacio, now home to the Arag\u00f3n Assembly, enjoys special status as a classic example of Mudejar architecture. It has been lovingly restored over a period of years. It's easy to imagine former residents living and working in these beautiful surroundings. The caf\u00e9 was worth a",
          "Definitely worth a visit. The tour is included in the entry price and very good. Only available in Spanish in the off season. Free entry on Sundays.",
          "Interesting to see all the different architectural building phases and learn about the history from the time of the construction.",
          "This is a great place to visit. Guided tours in English are only held during June and July however There is plenty of information in English throughout the Palacio. The main areas all have holders with leaflets in various languages which are informative and well written. Audio",
          "This palace is the most beautiful moorish castle in Spain outside Andalucia. Especially the patio and 2 rooms on the first floor are amazing.",
          "Not able to walk around as you wish - there is a guided route. Much of the palace can't be viewed, and is still used by the city's administration. Also, a great deal of restoration has been done so it all looks new. None the less, well worth a visit. Some of the painted ceilings",
          "A really interesting castle which is very different to other, Christian, castles around Europe. Informative guides around the castles in a number of different languages.",
          "Worth a look - especially for the elaborate ceilings. Walking distance from the main plaza for those who don't mind a walk.",
          "This is a must-see if you go to Zaragoza. And do go inside - it's absolutely gorgeous! I was happily wandering around in there for hours :)",
          "When in Zaragoza this is one of the things you must see. Beautiful to see the arches, rooms, ceilings and stairs. For only 5 Euro you get a good impression what this palace must have looked like 1000 years ago",
          "After Seville, a real letdown. The walls are bare and the gardens small... you can only walk on part of the ramparts.",
          "Amazing history and beautiful restoration of a great historical place. Go at 10 am or 5pm to take advantage of a free English tour. Have a walk around the grounds to take full view of the different sides of the castle",
          "The parliament of this autonomous region is placed here. This is a former palace where the so called Catholic King and Queen lived at the time they paid Columbus to make his trip to the Americas",
          "Like all Muslim buildings, la Aljaferia is gorgeous. It cost 5 euros to get in and was not full of tourists. The gardens amazing. Small enough to be seen in an hour. We found it hard to find parking around.",
          "By far the best of the 'monuments' - lovely building, great internal garden and the information provided is very good.",
          "This beautiful Palace seems to be the smaller sister of the famous Alhambra in Granada. When you wonder around you get from one beautiful decorated room to the other. Especially some of the ceilings have beautiful decorations The Palace is a short walk from the center (20",
          "The palace is somewhat outside the centre, but worthwhile the 20 min walk (in 32 degrees). Beautiful architecture, impressive wooden ceilings. Harmonious.",
          "Ok this palace is good,but too little info also in english,you get a brochure in Spanish,that's it.The lunch break that they have nearly diminished my wish to go back,but still we stayed more hours in the city so that we could see the indoors.The total time you will spend for",
          "First off, I fully agree to get those most out of this place, you should go on a guided tour. If you are not, then there are English pamphlets in the major areas for you to read (it's a bit dark in some of the rooms) about what you are seeing. I found the place extremely",
          "The Palacio de la Aljaferia is a stunning fortified Islamic castle built in the second half of the 11th century, after the capture of Zaragoza by Alfonso I of Aragon in 1118 the Palacio became the home of the Christian kings. The palace is now the seat of the Aragon Parliament.",
          "This is a pleasant walk to the palace - take in Europa square and Cleopatra's needle. Because of the reviews, we decided not to go in to the palace and just wander around the outside. The exterior is quite impressive, again plenty of photo opps. The moat is pretty. Lots of",
          "I wished they could have taken more care of it, but more or less preserved.Love the history from, muslim world to Catholic kings to now a place from the Aragon\u00e9s parlament, a castle by the way!!!",
          "The Palace is a mini version of Al-hambra, So if you never been to both this place is a good introduction and if you already have, you can give it a visit for it's relaxed surrounding Park. Free on Sunday, and you can see is limited, so take a guided tour for a full",

          "Discrepant information online, but it is, in fact, free on Sundays. We thought it was a lovely palace with a well maintained exterior. If you've seen Alhambra, you don't need to go out of your way. If you're in Zaragoza, it is worth going if only for the lovely and quiet park",
          "Not much to see. I love castles, but this one had been destroyed pretty much and parts rebuilt in the late 20th century. They'd just had some kind of exhibition, so the interior was closed, although one could go into one courtyard for free. Not worth the walk there, although",
          "This is a wonderful castle with a lot of its original features.It is well worth a visit with its very Moorish Decorative arches and Rooms. When you arrive ,you are given a pamphlet of information about the Palace,also wheel chair friendly.",
          "Palacio de La Aljaferia is a grea reaissance palace, built by Fernando el Catolico king over an old arabian castle. Most of arabian architecture remains, being the building a magnificient example of renaissance and arabian architectue fusion.",
          "The museum is very interesting, it contains valuable pieces. The architecture - inside and outside - combines the Spanish and Islamic styles. The entrance fee is OK (5 Euro for adults, and 1 Euro for students and children).",
          "Interesting & worth a visit. Pensioners pay 1\u20ac & it is well spent. When we went there was a fascinating and huge exhibition about King Ferdinand II (of Ferdinand & Isabela) who fought & won against the Moors, united Spain & expanded his empire. The original moorish place",
          "A must visit if you are in the city and you will never regret the trip into history, culture and architecture. Was definitely worth it",
          "Visit was ok despite the best efforts of the security/ tourism staff to put us off. Seems to be a bit random in the execution - little in the way of information regarding the whys and wherefores.",
          "The Palacio de la Aljaferia is a fine example of Mudhajer fortress design. Impeccably laid out with seductive islamic designs. In all, grand. But to me it suffers too much from the comparison with the breath-taking Alhambra and the Generalife in Granada. Perhaps too much",
          "I loved the Moorish architecture and only wished it was possible to see more. What you could see was very good but it seemed that most of our time was spent walking through exhibits- which were good but I am more interested in the architecture",
          "Learnt a lot here. Moorish building like those built in the North African desert. Cool arches and orange trees. Never realized how important King Fernando 11 was. Almost ruler of whole world. Very interesting graph of his contemporary famous people like De Vinci and Copernicus.",
          "Various styles of architecture are on view here. After visiting many impressive buildings in Spain this was a bit underwhelming. We stayed in the old town and this was about a 30 minute walk or so.",
          "Not disappointed at all... A different design... A different atmosphere... And a quiet place... Well kept... Well preserved... And definitely worth seeing",
          "The site is a20 min walk from the city centre in a residential and commercial areas. The place isn't anything like the Alambhra but few places are. The building is a little stark and shows a range of influences and is more Spanish Christian than expected. So I enjoyed the",

          "A Moorish palace in the heart of Zaragoza which has been declared UNESCO World Heritage. It was built as leisure retreat and a defensive building in the 11th-century . The remains of the fortified area can still be seen. The palace has a quadrangular floor plan with rounded",
          "The architecture is beatifull, small exhibition area, they have closed half of the palace and it acommodates the congressmen of Zaragoza, a part of the palace you can\u00b4t visit",
          "Massive entrance promises a lot but when inside Aljaferia is bit disappointing. Nice patio with some Moorish arches (but not even close to famous Alhambra in Granada or the Alcazar in Seville) and old mosque but when you get to the floor, the exhibitions are mostly in Spanish",
          "Went here on a Sunday morning , the queue was fairly long but moved quickly. From the outside it looked like a lovely castle , well maintained with an impressive approach. When inside we could only view about half the Palacio , a great exposition about Fernando - few good",
          "i only give it three marks because i am comparing it to the al hambra palaces in granda and alcazar of seville. It is still lovely and worth a visit.",
          "A fascinating journey back through northern Spain's marvellous history. The mix of Moorish and Spanish architecture and design makes for a fascinating building with a lot of questions to answer for those who will ask them.",
          "Well, it's five euro price tag and the long wait in line might be more than this particular palace is worth. Still, I wouldn't suggest that you miss it. It's no Alhambra, but what is? It is what it is, and perhaps you could time your trip for a Sunday when it's free.",
          "Massive entrance promises a lot but when inside Aljaferia is bit dissapointing. Nice patio with some Moorish arches (but not even close to famous Alhambra) and old mosque but when you get to the floor, the exhibitions are mostly in Spanish and the only things that can be fully",
          "In 2014 I could visit the palace and learn about the building and its changes over 1000 years. I learnt about the arab culture and its art, about the Christian development and how it changed the palace. April 2015 has seen the heart pulled out of the palace with rooms",
          "The different design and the different history behind it was really impressive... Being a part of a different culture that was there in the past... It was the third most attractive Arabic place after the mosque in Cordoba and the palace in Seville",
          "Supposed to be a world heritage site but can't think why. Long queue to get in. Once inside some reasonably interesting architecture on the ground floor. Most of the interior could have been any modern building with glass show cases displaying books, jewelery and various bits",
          "If you've been to Granada and La Alhambra, this is like La Alhambra's baby brother. Except this palace is in the middle of the city with apartments and a park nearby. The palace is not that big and can easily be seen in less than 90 minutes, including the guided tour. My guided",

          "We were staying by El Pilar, and this was a nice side trip. It is not too far from the city center, so we were able to walk here. We wandered the halls enjoying the beautiful decor and architecture. If you are looking for something different, you should visit.",
          "interesting castle, the mix of the old and new, the Islamic style and the Arag\u00f3n style. Easy to access, don't forget your camera! :)",
          "Take the tour, check times before, well worth the one hour visit. Well explained, and full of photo ops.",
          "The Aljaferia was a wreck until the 1950s, when the restoration effort began. A former Islamic and Christian palace, it is now possible to see what is original and what is restored. A good guide is very helpful, since not much of the information is in English. Like other palaces",
          "This is a great sightseeing stop. The palace is restored from the ruins of the 12th century, and includes a well from the 10th century. The guide was magnificent and extremely thorough. I enjoyed it so much that I have made multiple visits.",
          "We went there on thursday.It was about 12:15am ,but a policeman more showed than told us(spanish), that the complex is closed. After all we understood \"parlamento\" and \"politicos\" so we conjectured,that the government is doing its work...But I do not understand,WHY we-as the",
          "We walked to the palace from the Pilar square on Sunday afternoon. With opening hours till 8pm during the summer season this gave us ample time to wonder around this beautiful Palace. It is described as one of the most representative and emblematic monuments of Aragonese Mudejar",
          "We were very lucky when we visited this recently. There are English tours available at limited times and we were able to go on one with two other people. So, we were in a group of four with our own tour guide. I think her name was Bea and she was a tremendous McFly and McBusted",
          "Well, as a young couple without a guide we didn't find it particularly interesting. Few people spoke english and most of the signs were in Spanish... so we couldn't understand much. It is a nice place though especially if you like islamic architecture.",
          "Looks like a fortress from the outside but inside is the former Islamic palace with stunning work, added to by the kings who took over later...the catholics built on top of it. Senior discount to enter is 1 euro. Best 1 euro we ever spent. Do not miss. You can walk here from",
          "The MAP room is incredible but I'm so glad I did not pay good Euros for this. I expected to be able to walk around the top and was disappointed. Not very accessible, I wanted to look out a tower or something.",
          "Sure it has been extensively remodelled over time, but it is easy to look past that. The courtyard and its cool radiance with citrus trees, herbs and palms sets the Moorish scene. You will be taken on an architectural tour starting in the 9th Century and ending in 1982. Along",
          "the discount for students was perfect, I only had to pay 1 euro... the interior is quite stunning for someone who hasn't seen medieval Islamic architecture, but then you quickly realize that much of it is restored, only the mihrab looks ancient!! the tower of the trovador is",
          "An amazing place, full of beauty and history, in the northern reaches of Moorish Spain. We went when it was free (Sunday afternoon? Check the listing from the TI) and were able to join a guided tour. Ours was in Spanish but there are some in English. Don't miss this!",
          "Loved our visit to this fortress/palace. So incredibly affordable! As seniors, we paid only 1 euro and that included an english speaking tour guide. We were very fortunate to be in a group of only three! guide very informative. As a history buff, I really enjoyed learning",
          "Incredible mix of cultures with actually 3 palaces in one building: islamic, Pedro IVth and Reyes Catolicos. This building has also known Spanish Inquisition and the presence of an army. there are tracks from each civilisation and it is impressive.",
          "Such a beautiful place! Really worth spending some time here seeing the castle both inside and outside. And at a 5 euro rate it is quite cheap! Enjoy :)",
          "really enjoyed the couple of hours here cheap entrance well worth it,quite a lot of palace too see.loved the grand staircase too name one of a few great things too see.not too sure of the opening hours for the public be wise to check this first.",
          "Beautiful and significant building now protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. Moorish craftsmanship is especially wonderful. Used by the provincial government as its meeting headquarters so check for hours open to the public. Well worth the 5 Euros price of admission.",
          "All the areas visitors can see are very, very impressive - moat, lawns, walls, the Islamic halls on the ground floor, the Christian halls above, the grand staircase\u2026 In ways like the Alcazar in Seville, but a lot smaller and more concentrated. When I went it was difficult to",
          "This palace is absolutely beautiful. You really have to visit it! There were no tours in English (only in Spanish) and that's a pity. The palace is like a labyrinth, so maybe they should put up more signs.",
          "An attraction well worth visiting. It shows the history of Spain in a different way, showing how the different cultures mixed together. Parts were a bit sparse and the English descriptions poor, unless you hired the speaker system. Note take care with opening times it shut in",
          "for same price, join the guided tour, we could learn and see a lot, wont miss that! the extra informations about history and what some ideas where by build it that way....... a bit long walk from heard of time, maybe take the bus",
          "We really liked the Aljaferia Palace. You can definitely see the combination of different cultures. One and only minus point is that English brochures weren't sufficient enough. Other than that it was a really nice experience. if somehow you're in Zaragoza, you must definitely",
          "The Aljaferia is worth a visit (particularly when free!), and most impressive from the outside. Don't get me wrong: it is worth having a look around inside, but there are few signs in English explaining what you are seeing so get yourself a guide to bring the place to life.",
          "The islamic part is the most beautiful in terms of the building and the little patio garden. The Christian parts have some nice ceiling paintings but in general are not as interesting. Still - worth a visit.",
          "Built in the XI century, this old moorish palace have been through a turbullent history. Learn about it as you take a walk through the inner courtyard (there you\u2019ll probably think you are in Granada), the splendorous archs of the Golden Hall and the beatiful mihrab (pointing to",
          "The castle is open till 8 pm and is worth a visit. The ticket is 5 euro. You should surely go to first floor to see the Christian part of the palace. Take a lot of photos.",
          "a very special place where Islamic and catholic religion are mixed . the staff is great every one is ready to help ... every room is a master peace ... you cant regret the visit with a group or alone ..",
          "I work just outside of Aljafer\u00eda and have never gone inside until the day. It's modest (after seeing Alhambra) but still has beautiful and intricate architecture.",
          "We went here after we'd visited the Alhambra in Granada, and it was a great way to see more of the Islamic history in Spain. The building was still under renovation (I believe it has been for a number of years) but a lot has been done already, so it's really exciting to be able",
          "Its worth a visit although much is actually restored. Isabel's garden inside is screened by some amazing arches where east meets west. the ceilings are intriguing, The palace has had a number of uses. Its worth looking where the prisoners etched.",
          "The castle is unique piece of a building that has the east end west cultures meet. It is located in a pitch that is a king of precaution against attacks of the time. \u0131nside the walls there meet you a garden of fruit trees, a water sysystem of canals and a fountain that makes",
          "I missed the opportunity to visit this place 15 yrs ago and was thrilled when we got in. Unfortunately very little remained of original taifa and aragonese palace, this building is mostly replica/reconstruction of what it used to be during the arab rule. Several rooms preserved",
          "If you want to see a concentration of history in zaragoza, go to this site. It is very impressive, some of the rooms are reproductions and you need to use your imagination.",
          "Intact outer Walls. Care and attention to the old Moorish rooms and tasteful remodelling by later Kings and Queens. Atmospheric garden.",
          "We visited this castle and my take away impressions were that it was quite good to look at from the exterior but inside, you can only visit a small area. None of the walls, ramparts or towers were open to the public. The moorish art, frescos, carved stone interiors, etc. were",
          "This was a real surprise. We came across it on a Sunday (so free, even better!) and was lovely. A lot of the Mudejar (forgive my spelling) bits were heavily restored, but still quite a stunning place. The later bits, (15/16th centuries) put my moans about painting the ceiling",
          "A real surprise: an ancient muslim palace with really special ceilings in many of the major rooms. The Royal chamber and adjoining rooms were impressive. Wonderful views around the site.",
          "This castle has a beautiful architecture and it is definitely a place worth visiting! I wouldn't be able to tell much about the museum inside, since walking around without a guide is probably not the best idea, but it still has amazing vues, with a beautiful oriental style.",
          "Loved this castle with its mudjedar architecture. It was quite spectacular. Ask in the excellent tourist info offices in Zaragoza and they will give you a whole list of free stuff to see on Sundays - this is one of them - otherwise it costs 5 euros to get in - which was well",
          "Amazing visit. But has to be with a guide. Don\u00b4try to go without. Without the guide you will miss a lot os history and stories as well as you won\u00b4t be ableto visit the congress.",

          "The Aljaferia reflects the various occupations of the region within its walls.. A guided tour is highly recommended. The palace is closed to visitors on days that the government meets there, so check at the tourist office before you go.",
          "Had a guided tour in Spanish. Our friends from zaragoza interpreted for us. Islamic beginnings, then Spanish influence. Ferdinand and and Isabella quizzed Columbus here about coming to new world.",
          "Impressive from the outside but disappointing inside except for the moorish courtyards and the ceilings. The history of the castle is very complicated and I had a feeling that even the historians had difficulties attributing who did what. Even so the castle is open until 8:00pm",
          "The Aljaferia Palace is both an historic monument and the seat of the regional government, so access is limited in some areas depending on when the representatives are sitting. Also the Palace has been modified to allow for modern day governmental needs. However, despite these",

          "Guided tours can be booked at Zuda Tower. No disappointment at all! Very professional guides for two hours. It's 6\u20ac x pax and worth it",
          "Interesting history and beautiful architecture, take the guided tour, excellent. Avoid going there at lunch time, since it will be closed.",
          "I did not know about this Moorish Palace in Zaragoza and later converted in a Palace of Isabel and Fernando, well worth the visit and to see the amazing rooms.",
          "I did not get the chance to go inside due to the time we turned up however the outside and it's surrounding gardens and little hill were beautiful. I can imagine it being quite stunning from the inside. I wish I knew it was open and free on Sunday otherwise I'd have made another",
          "Ok. It's not La Alhambra. But who can expect to find a Moorish castle so up north? The people I have taken to visit it have nearly always been both surprised and delighted, even when they had already been in Andaluc\u00eda. I like the main garden with all the arcs and the mihrab.",
          "We turned up on Sunday having been caught out by the lunch gap between 14.00 - 16.30 the previous day. However, delighted to find out it was free on Sundays (\u20ac5 normally) and well worth it - extremely impressive interior and lovely gardens. Definitely worth the 15 minute",
          "The palace has an amazing millennium-long history to it, and the fact that it's still used as a parliament makes it even more interesting. Due to its function, you can only get into parts of the building, which makes the tour a bit awkward in places, but it's worth it",
          "This is an amazing place, filled with history! Being able to walk among the Moorish remains was a true gift. The place is filled with nooks and crannies containing all sorts of treasures. The site is enormous, not only in its size but its historically beauty and significance.",
          "A lovey place with amazing architecture. I really enjoyed it, but fazed out toward the end of looking around as everything all began to look the same in the heat! It was a lovely attraction to visit though, with many hidden little rooms, I kept on walking past side rooms that",
          "We were very lucky to arrive just as it was opening for the afternoon at 16:30 (siesta 13:30-16:30). As pensioners it was just 1 euro a head. It would have been well worth it at full price (3 euro a head). If you like Moorish designs then you will like this.",
          "Different architecture styles, from moors ruling times to Isabel and Fernando united Spanish kingdom. It changed from an Alcazar (Moorish fortress) to king\u2019s palace. Part of the building houses the Regional Parliament of Arag\u00f3n, an example of new uses given to this huge palace.",
          "The horseshoe arches and intricate geometric adornments in the Moorish courtyard of this 11th C. palace are well preserved, and give a hint of Arabic elegance. So much was destroyed at the Christian reconquest, so it's like a miracle to see all this so far north in Spain.",
          "Free entry on Sunday morning - which is when we went. Not sure I'd have wanted to pay the entry fee for this having been to the Mezquita in Cordoba, the Alhambra in Granada and mosques in Samarkand and Bukhara.",
          "The building itself wasn't open for visiting, but the view of the outside is breathtaking! Traditional Arabic entrance and architecture, nice for a little photo op after seeing the plaza de toros which is right around the corner.",
          "IT IS REALLY SO, you can walk through the centuries in Aljaferia. The other name of the place is Cortes de Aragon. You can guess by these names that it used to be a Muslim palace, then a Christian castle and afterwards Aragon Kings Palace. You will admire all three hypostasis",
          "It really is beautiful a true castle...but it was closed and we could not go in. Suggest you find out the schedule as we missed going inside, it was difficult to find out their schedule, there were a bunch of tourists gathered all trying to figure it out. The instructions were",
          "Is a XI Century Palace with some changes tru the centuries, was built by islamics but after was conquered by Christians, so you can find a mixture of styles! I loved the decoration, a lot was destroyed, but made the effort of restore some parts. I suggest a visit!",
          "The palace has been in function for many centuries. First as a muslim palace, then christian palace, even military headquarters. But the restoration it has undergone shows a bit of the main periods, so you can have a very good idea of what it was like.",
          "While I fully understand the disappointment of those who have visited the Alhambra in Granada I feel that it is wrong to draw comparisons. The Palacio de la Aljaferia is a fortress made of different styles in different ages. It must be remembered also that the Palace is",

          "Considering the fact the building is the ofice of the Cortes of Aragon and you could expect there would only be a couple of areas to see, I would say the Museum part is pretty big and interesting. The inner yard looks fantastic! The best spot in whole castle! Green garden in",
          "nothing compared to the Alhambra in Granada, but still nice.it shows all the styles that characterize Saragozza's history:arabic, mud\u00e9jar and catholic.the ticket is a little too expensive for the place",

          "Let me put it straight: this bogus attraction is nothing to be considered even remotely close to The Alhambra or The Royal Alcazar. There is about a single hall (well maybe two of those?) adorned with the typical (and, in this case, simplistic) Islamic ornament which was,",
          "By pure luck we got to visit the building for free (First Sunday of the month?) and with a guided tour. It's a pity that the visit is done in chronological order: Islamic palace, early Christian Kings, \"Catholic\" (Ferdinand and Isabel) Kings and current State Congress. That",

          "Beautiful way to see & learn about the ways the people of the land adjusted 1 palace to represent the history of the space. So many architectural influences in one massive building. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "beautiful architecture with different culture, nice place to have a photo \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Guide was very informative. Almost 1000 year old history. Both Muslim & Christian cultures can be seen in it's architecture. Part of building in current use by parliament. You can visit that room as well when not in session.",
          "This is one beautiful modern castle...different from the others I have visited in Spain, especially the architecture",
          "It was an amazing experience, the castle is well restored, beautifully illuminated. I was enamored by the architecture and the beauty of the castle. I even felt sorry when I finished the tour because I feel like there are so many untold stories that need to be revealed in that castle. It was the highlight of my visit to zaragoza",
          "Heavily restored mujedar courtyard of some beauty and some impressive interiors but the best part is staring at the amazing exterior.",
          "It is a spectacular building, there is no entrance fee in the second sunday of the month. The courtyard is similar to Seville alcazar or Alhambra, but it's smaller. However, the details from the famous moorish arches are larger than the \u2026",
          "Very nice architecture, free to visit inside.",
          "The surrounding of the park is extremely gorgeous, that I cannot even explain in thousands and millions of beautiful words. The park is surrounded by at least one hundred trees that are approximately 30 feet in height. It provides me nice \u2026",
          "Reasonably impressive museum which costs 5 euro to enter. There is also an audio guide available for 3 euro while leaving some id. This is not fully needed as most locations have laminated pages of information in English. Note that this is part moorish part Spanish as one built the castle and the other expanded it...",
          "Beautiful old Arabic place. One of the best places in Zaragoza.",
          "Beautiful architecture.  Incredible amount of work out in to this place.  The guided tour makes it totally worth the visit.",
          "Great experience. I highly recommend the guided tour because it has the same price but with all the information and details.",
          "Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. Mix od muslim and christian architecture, Aljaferia palace is in an unassuming location, and still a functioning place (I think used by Aragonese parliament) and should definitely be visited. Entry was 5 euros, just one for students.",
          "It\u2019s one of the world cultural heritage monument built in 11th century by Islamic Kings with beautiful wooden carved ceilings. After the reconquest by the Christian Kings it underwent many reforms until it was finally restored as present \u2026",
          "Definitely worth a visit! The building is really something that stands out from the rest of Zaragoza.",
          "The place is well preserved and has very rich history. Very beautiful history. I would encourage everyone to visit el Aljafer\u00eda at least once in their lives.",
          "A lovely palace in the middle of the city. Parked in the free dirt lot behind the palace. \u20ac5 entry and we spent a little under an hour here. Ramp access into the first area with the gardens and lift access up to the top level but stairs elsewhere. There's a cafe onsite if you feel peckish.",
          "Fairy tale castle and palace, an Unesco World Heritage monument, with long, rich history, going back to 11th century from the Arabs to the Catholic Kings, surviving, heavily renovated, until our days, as the seat of local parliament. \u2026",
          "very nice place. at the time of our visit, the interior was closed for renovation, but it is definitely on the list of my things to visit next time I go to Spain.",
          "Architecture very nice... Not really impressive. Ok for historical info about Aragon",
          "Imposing and majestic in the middle of a park.  I can't get in but it was worth the visit.",

          "A must-visit place during your stay in Zaragoza.",
          "A well-kept historical treasure in Zaragoza! A visit is a must. It is a few minutes away by bus from the Zaragoza-Delicias Train Station.",
          "Stunning place worth the visit, better with a guide that will explain everything you can see.",
          "The beauty and historical importance to Spain and the entirety of old Europe that this ancient edifice holds can't be overstated. If you're driven by architecture, history, the arts, or culture then this location is a must see, if you're in the area.",
          "This place is simply beautiful and magnificent. Very recomended.",
          "Modest when you compare it with andalusian palaces, but has many Moorish elements in its architecture - decorations mostly. Surprisingly from the outside looks like European medieval castle. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful palace. Very unique blend of cultural and religious history",
          "Islamic calligraphy that is very beautiful shows that Islamic civilization in Zaragoza is  their ancestors who lived harmony despite cultural differences.",
          "A very interesting place combining the Moorish roots with later Christian influences. The castle is currently a seat of the parliament of Aragon, so its bigger part is inaccesible for visitants. But still it\u2019s worth to spend some time \u2026",
          "Nicely restored.  Inexpensive entry fee",
          "This is must see place. It shows the history of the Muslims when they built the civilization in Europe long time ago. It called in Arabic Kazer Alsoror means the happiness and you can\u2019t feel the happiness whit the first step inside the \u2026",
          "A beautiful palace with a thousand years of history... Absolutely phantastic..",
          "Beautiful place with a rich history behind it. Only a portion of the palace is open for the public though. The rest is occupied by local parliament.\nThe best things are the courtyard and ceilings in the displayed rooms, not much more has survived...",
          "Just walked around the outsidea, worth a visit. Still kept in great condition.",
          "Great example of mujedar architecture. Little Alhambra without the crowds.",
          "A beautiful place to visit with family, groups or by your self. A lot of history in this awesome palace",
          "If you like the Alhambra I think this place is worth visiting when in Zaragoza, it\u2019s really beautiful and not too well known. I wouldn\u2019t compare it, however, to the grand Alhambra either, but still la aljafer\u00eda is incredibly beautiful especially when the oranges are in bloom",
          "Super interesting! Worth taking a look and spending the time.",
          "Nice castle that shows three periods of time and three styles in one building. I recommend it. The Muslim part is most impressive.",
          "Seems very beautiful, I put 4 instead of 5 because I haven't been inside. The Castel is closed for the parlement.\nIt should be kept for visiting only :)",
          "It is worth a visit. But make sure that you plan for them closing down 30 minutes before the posted closing time. We arrived there at 1:15pm and the attendant assured us that we would have at least 45 minutes before they closed at 2pm as \u2026",
          "My friend and I stopped here on a drive from Madrid to Barcelona. It is so interesting to see the styles of Islamic architecture that was later taken over by the Aragon family into a Catholic palace. They have almost no infrastructure for \u2026",
          "Spectacular place to visit, it has guides and information but most of it is in Spanish. There are a few parts that would have been nice to visit but aren't available for the public.",
          "A great way to spend a day! Highly recommend going on a Sunday as it\u2019s free otherwise usually 5\u20ac entry.",
          "Really nice the ground floor where you can have access free of charge. The visit with entry to pay it\u2019s not really worth",
          "An amazing sight of Zaragoza (if not the best one). I believe the entry is \u20ac2 but I have not been inside.\nDefinitely worth a see.",
          "Amazing castle that you can get into for free. Only the audio tour costs money and it is gorgeous inside. Awesome little piece of Arag\u00f3n history you will love. Go in the morning for excellent lighting!",
          "Close to the train station. Should not spend more than 45min. There is cafeteria inside. The entry fee is 5\u20ac but you get a discount if you are students.",
          "Really nice, will not be regret to go there",
          "One of my favorite touristic places of my city. The place is full of history and gives you a feeling of being back to the south of Spain. The visiting is FREE on SUNDAY",
          "Absolutely must see place in Zaragoza. Moorish/Arabic architecture melting with medieval European architecture, history set in stone.",
          "Well worth the detour from city center; free entry on Sundays",
          "I have to return tomorrow when it is open to the public and not being used for official business. From the outside it looks fascinating.",
          "A really nice place to visit if you are in Zaragoza.",
          "Beautiful well maintained castle. Would recommend visiting. We went on Sunday and apparently entrance was free on Sunday!",
          "Great home style food.  Great service.",
          "Great Palace. Actually 3 palaces. Make sure you get a guided tour, otherwise you won't know the details of the palaces. It's totally worth it.",
          "Amazing mudejar palace! 5 euro entrance fee, with reduction for students etc",
          "A scene that blows you more than 500 years back to the golden age, in which the science was the flag of this country and its decoration from a nation who took the quran as a way of living and as a reference of everything.\n\u064a\u062a\u0641\u0637\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0648 \u062a\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0645\u0639\u0627",
          "5 estrellas! Amazing experience not to be missed",
          "This was one of the highlights of my entire trip to Spain. You need to speak Spanish or travel with someone who does, but if you check that box, it's well-worth your time. The cost of entry was worth it and it was one spot that I didn't feel overwhelmed by tourists the whole time.",
          "Always be very beautiful",
          "Very interesting place full of history I really recommend the guided tour you learn a lot",
          "Truly historic place and the most well-preserved Moorish legacy in the outer Andalusia. Now functions as local parliament building.",
          "Took the guided tour. Amazing insight into the history of the region.",
          "Interesting piece of history in Zaragoza that shows the muslimic influence and describes the historical facts with many explanations inside. A view is recommended, especially because of the colorful ceilings and the middle east style. Also \u2026",
          "Great historic place, on Monday to Saturday tou can go in side for a small fee but on Sunday it's free",

          "Very informative and interesting location which teaches a lot about Spain's Islamic past and medieval heritage. Would recommend to people interested in history!",
          "Fantastic place to visit, super atmosphere, stunning exhibits and hardly any tourists. Superb value for money, closed in the afternoon. Recommended.",
          "There is much to enjoy at this very heavily restored castle. It is steeped in history from the Hispano-Muslim era to the current day. It would be great if more of that history was illuminated by the presentation of the palace, but it remains on a par (almost) with the Alhambra.",
          "It's a very interesting recount of the restoration process, as well as of the history and changes the building underwent. I recommend taking the time to read the guides left in every exhibit.",
          "Quite dull to be honest, but 4th star is just for the inner courtyard which is beautiful and interesting.\nFree on Sundays, wouldn't pay for it otherwise.",
          "Gorgeous seen at night when it's lit up; during the day, the palace offers some lovely spaces and bits of old mud\u00e9jar architecture and design. The orange grove courtyard is thoughtfully reconstructed, and the multifoil arches make a \u2026",

          "A lovely naranja courtyard similar to the Alhambra. The public Access area is quite small but charming.",
          "A palace/museum still in use today by the provincial goverment. Interesting and varied history from early Muslim times through various conquests. Good to see samples of the earliest days along with more recent times and restored items. Certainly worth a visit, even if you are not a museum lover \ud83d\ude09",
          "Free entrance on sunday. There are cards with explanation for each place in the palace in different laguages. I had a realy nice experience here and it is a \"must go\" if you visit Zaragoza!",

          "Very nice place... if you go on Sunday the entrance is free ;-)",

          "Nice to see.  Not much historical context of what parts of walls are original and what was added during each occupation.  One small area gives a timeline of occupants, but little else.  The architecture is really nice and some areas have been preserved well.",
          "The castle seems huge on the outside, but inside there are so many area which are not permitted to visit\nStill recommend to visit because the inside is very particular",
          "Beautiful palace with islamic architecture. It\u2019s also the place of the parliament of Aragon, so the palace will be closed during the sessions.",
          "Don\u2019t understand much of it... (but I didn\u2019t take a tour, so probably missed the point). \u20ac5 for regulars, \u20ac1 if you are a student.",
          "The design and detail in the building is astounding. Well worth a visit. The models of the castle changes over the eras were very  interesting. Would have  liked to explore more of the castle though.",
          "This is a beautifully restored palace with a lot of history so allow a good hour to visit. Unfortunately, we were sold an entrance ticket 20 minutes before closing - it closes between 2 and 4pm which we weren't expecting for a tourist \u2026",

          "Stunning architecture and history. A must see in Zaragoza",
          "middling. much of the palace\u2019s interior decor has been covered over, and very few rooms and only one small courtyard garden are open to visitors. nothing here that you can\u2019t see in far more impressive fashion at the Mezquita of C\u00f3rdoba or \u2026",
          "I really liked this, but too much restoration but interesting",

          "The Northern Moorish Palace in Iberia. A few things remain from the original once it was several times rebuilted along the centuries. Worth a visit",
          "Beautiful tower. We visited at night so we weren't able to go inside when it was closed. The walkway around it was well lit and cool weather made for a nice night.",
          "Clean and empty. Entirely new design and has no \"smell\" of history! Not worth 4 Euro for the ticket. Waste of time and money...",
          "An interesting place. Good for a quick stop off",

          "We visited this yesterday. We were disappointed with the outside, but were hoping the inside would make up for that. It did not. We were hoping for a miniature version of the Alhambra, but this was just sad. I would not waste my money on this. Visit the basilica instead.",

        "wiki": "Our Lady of the Pillar (Spanish: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar) is the name given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the context of the traditional belief that Mary, while living in Jerusalem, supernaturally appeared to the Apostle James the Greater in AD 40 while he was preaching in what is now Spain. Those who adhere to this belief consider this appearance to be the only recorded instance of Mary exhibiting the mystical phenomenon of bilocation. Among Catholics, it is also considered the first Marian apparition, being unique due to having occurred while Mary was still living on Earth.This title is also associated with a wooden image commemorating the apparition, which is now enshrined at the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. Pope Callixtus III granted indulgences for visitors to the shrine in 1456.  Pope Innocent XIII in 1730 mandated her veneration throughout the Spanish Empire. On 20 May 1905, Pope Pius X granted the image a canonical coronation.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is considered the Patroness of Aragon and its capital Zaragoza, and of the Spanish Civil Guard. Her feast day is 12 October, which coincides with Columbus Day, the national holiday of Spain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early tradition ===\n\nCatholic tradition holds that, in the early days of Christianity, the Apostles of Jesus spread the Gospel throughout the known world, with James the Greater evangelizing in Roman Hispania (modern-day Spain). He confronted great difficulties in his missionary efforts and faced severe discouragement. In AD 40, while he was praying by the banks of the Ebro at Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza), Mary bilocated from Jerusalem, where she was living at the time, and appeared to James, accompanied by thousands of angels, to console and encourage him.Some of the earliest archaeological evidence of Marian devotion in Zaragoza is found in Christian tombs dating from Roman days, which appear to bear images representing the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. In the 4th century, the presence of votive images placed on columns or pillars is attested. The oldest written testimony of devotion to the Blessed Virgin in Zaragoza is usually identified as that of Pedro Librana in 1155. There is evidence that the site attracted pilgrims from across the Iberian Peninsula during the 13th century, e.g. reflected in the work Milagros de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora by Gonzalo de Berceo, dated to the 1250s or early 1260s. The appellation Santa Mar\u00eda del Pilar is attested for 1299.\nThe claim that the first church had been the oldest in Hispania, built in AD 40 by James the Greater, is first recorded in 1318.The tradition of the Marian apparition can be traced to the 15th century: In either 1434 or 1435, a fire destroyed the alabaster altarpiece. The replacement altarpiece features bas-relief representations of the Marian apparition. The image of the Virgen del Pilar venerated today also dates to this period. It executed in the late Gothic style of Juan de la Huerta.Pope Calixtus III in a bull issued on 23 September 1456 declares a seven year indulgence for those who visit Our Lady of Saragossa. The text of the bull specifically mentions a pillar, for the first time suggesting the existence of an image known as Our Lady of the Pillar.\nThe feast day of 12 October was officially introduced by the Council of Zaragoza in 1640.According to the account by Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda (d. 1665) in her Mystical City of God, Mary, mother of Jesus, was transported from Jerusalem to Hispania during the night, on a cloud carried by angels. During the journey, the angels also built a pillar of marble, and a miniature image of Mary with the Child Jesus.\n\n\n=== Approval ===\n\nThe apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar was accepted as canonical by Pope Innocent XIII in 1723. So many contradictions had arisen concerning the miraculous origin of the church that Spain appealed to Innocent XIII to settle the controversy. After careful investigation, the twelve cardinals, in whose hands the affair rested, adopted the following account, which was approved by the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 7 August 1723, and later inserted in the lessons of the office of the feast of our Lady of the Pillar, celebrated on 12 October:\n\nOf all the places that Spain offers for the veneration of the devout, the most illustrious is doubtless the sanctuary consecrated to God under the invocation of the Blessed Virgin, under the title of our Lady of the Pillar, at Saragossa.\nAccording to ancient and pious tradition, St. James the Greater, led by Providence into Spain, spent some time at Saragossa. He there received a signal favour from the Blessed Virgin. As he was praying with his disciples one night, upon the banks of the Ebro, as the same tradition informs us, the Mother of God, who still lived, appeared to him, and commanded him to erect an oratory in that place.  The apostle delayed not to obey this injunction, and with the assistance of his disciples soon constructed a small chapel. In the course of time a larger church was built and dedicated, which, with the dedication of Saint Saviour's, is kept as a festival in the city and Diocese of Saragossa on the 4th of October.\nJames returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a martyr, beheaded in AD 44 during the reign of Herod Agrippa. His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain. The year AD 40 is the earliest recognised Marian apparition in the Catholic Church,  dating to a time when Mary, the mother of Jesus, was still alive.Pope Clement XII allowed the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar all over the Spanish Empire in 1730.  Since the feast day (12 October) coincides with the discovery of the Americas (12 October 1492), Mary was later named as Patroness of the Hispanic World under this title.\n\n\n== Image ==\n\n\n=== Zaragoza ===\n\nA fire in 1434 burned down the church that preceded the present basilica.\nThe construction of the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, Zaragoza was started in 1681 and ended in 1711. \n\nThe wooden statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary is in the Late Gothic style. It stands 39 centimetres (15 in) tall, on a pillar of jasper with a height of 1.8 metres (5.9 ft).\nThe statue depicts Mary with the Child Jesus on her left arm, who has a dove sitting on his left palm.\nSome reports state that an earlier wooden image was destroyed when the church burned down in 1434, consistent with an attribution of the current image to Juan de la Huerta (d. 1462) or his school.It appears that folk belief in some cases may be inclined to regard the Saragossa image as miraculous, sculptured by the angels as they transported Mary from Jerusalem to Saragossa (Zaragoza); this mystical tradition goes back to Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda (d. 1665),  herself the object of frequent \"mystical bilocation\" (i.e. she reported that she was often \"transported by the aid of the angels\" ), who gave an account to this effect in her Mystical City of God; however, unlike the tradition of the Marian apparition itself, the miraculous origin of the image is not part of the tradition recognized by the Holy See as canonical.\nSince the 16th century, the pillar is usually draped in a skirt-like cover called manto \"mantle\".\nAs a whole, it is protected by a bronze case and then another case of silver.\nThe image was canonically crowned in 1905 during the reign of Pope Pius X.  The crown was designed by the Marquis of Gri\u00f1i, valued at 450,000 pesetas (c. USD 2.6 million as of 2017).\n\n\n=== Other depictions ===\nOur Lady of the Pillar is a common motif of the Madonna and Child in Spanish art; extant examples other than the Saragossa image date from the Renaissance period onward. Depictions become especially numerous following the introduction of the feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Feast day ==\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of the Pillar is celebrated on 12 October and she is the Patroness of the Hispanic peoples and the Spanish Civil Guard.  A grand nine-day festival known as Fiestas del Pilar is celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza) every year in her honour. The modern Fiestas del Pilar, as they developed since the 19th century, begin on the weekend preceding 12 October and they end on the Sunday after 12 October (i.e. they move between 5\u201313 and 11\u201319 October). They were declared as a \"national holiday of touristic interest\" (Fiesta de Inter\u00e9s Tur\u00edstico Nacional) by the Ministerio de Comercio y Turismo in 1980.\nAs 12 October happens to coincide with the day of the year 1492 when land was first sighted on Columbus' First Voyage, \nthe Fiesta de la Raza Espa\u00f1ola, first proposed in 1913 by Faustino Rodr\u00edguez-San Pedro y D\u00edaz-Arg\u00fcelles (in the USA later dubbed \"Columbus Day\", as Columbus tends to be considered Italian rather than Spanish in North America) falls on the same date.\nThe Fiesta de la Raza Espa\u00f1ola was declared the national holiday of Spain in a decree by Antonio Maura and king Alfonso XIII\nof 1918. The alternative name D\u00eda de la Hispanidad was proposed in the late 1920s by Ramiro de Maeztu, based on a suggestion by Zacar\u00edas de Vizcarra.\nAfter the Civil War, on 12 October 1939, the D\u00eda de la Raza was celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza), presided by Francisco Franco, with a special devotion to the Virgen del Pilar. Chilean foreign vice-secretary Germ\u00e1n Vergara Donoso commented that the \"profound significance of the celebration was the intimate inter-penetration of the homage to the Race and the devotion to Our Lady of the Pillar, i.e. the symbol of the ever more extensive union between America and Spain.\"\nThe name of D\u00eda de la Hispanidad was introduced as the official name of the national holiday in a decree of 9 January 1958.\nDuring the transition to democracy, there was a proposal to shift the national day to 6 December, the day of adoption of the Constitution, but in the end, in a decree of 1982, the day of 12 October was retained, under the name of  Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a y D\u00eda de la Hispanidad. In 1987, the name was reduced to just D\u00eda de la Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n== Veneration of Our Lady of the Pillar around the world ==\nPilar, short for Maria del Pilar, is a common Spanish given name, with name day on the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar.\n\n\n=== South America ===\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Pillar and St. Raphael in Melo, Uruguay\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar, Recoleta neighbourhood, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar, Pilar, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Pillar, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, Brazil\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the Philippines, ruled by Spain for over three hundred years, Our Lady of the Pillar is honored as the patroness of a number parishes and municipalities; seven are named Pilar in her honor.  There are towns named Pilar in the provinces of Abra, Bataan, Bohol, Capiz, Cebu, Surigao del Norte and Sorsogon.  As in Spain, her feast day is celebrated every 12 October.\n\nIn Zamboanga City, the Virgin of the Pillar has been venerated for almost four centuries as the patroness of the city and in the Archdiocese of Zamboanga. The bas relief of her atop the eastern gate of the 17th-century Spanish military fort dedicated to the Virgin, Fort Pilar (Full name: Royal Fort of our Virgin Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza, El Fuerte Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen del Pilar de Zaragoza), is now a Catholic Marian shrine. The city also has a street named after her \u2013 Pilar Street.\nIn Davao City, a shrine in honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar in Magsaysay Park was built through the collaborative efforts of Circulo Zamboangue\u00f1o de Davao, a local group of transposed from Zamboanga City.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is also the patroness of Santa Cruz parish church in the district of the same name, in the city of Manila.  The Jesuits brought the patroness when they administered the church during the Spanish era.  Her feast day is also celebrated every 12 October in the district. However, the church has its Marian procession in the 3rd week of October. The image was canonically crowned on 7 December 2017.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is the patroness of Imus, Cavite and the whole Province of Cavite, Diocese of Imus enshrined at the Imus Cathedral in Cavite province. The city celebrates its fiesta every October with the Karakol, a ritual dance-procession performed in fiestas around the province of Cavite. The image was canonically crowned on 3 December 2012.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is also the patroness, with 12 October as the feast day, in the following places:\nCity of Cauayan, Isabela.\nTown of Morong, Bataan.\nDon Rufino Alonzo Sr. Street Cotabato City Maguindanao.\nTown of Baleno, Masbate.\nTown of Pilar, Bataan.\nTown of Pilar, Bohol.\nTown of Pilar, Capiz\nTown of Pilar, Sorsogon.\nTown of San Simon, Pampanga.\nTown of Sibonga, Cebu.\nTown of Alaminos, Laguna.\nTown of Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro.\nTown & Diocese of Libmanan, Camarines Sur\nBrgy.

          "I actually walked in during an evening mass and the lights were dimmed so I wasn't able to fully see everything but even in the dark, this massive cathedral is stunning. It was also interesting to be there during a mass, watching locals just going to church, rather than just",
          "One of the largest Basilica\u2019s I have ever seen. There are almost two churches inside with numerous chapels (9). Well worth a visit. There is less traffic later in the afternoon as the tour groups wind down.",
          "The outside of this building is fascinating, & when the sun catches all the tiled domed towers, it is truly magical. The inside is just as fabulous in a generally more understated way. Though the interior domed chapel, made of carved wood, some of it painted, some gilded, is",
          "When we visited the place was decorated for Christmas and it was beautiful!!! It is really a beautiful place to visit!!!",
          "Incredibly statement of belief. The exterior architecture is nice, but not indicative of the amazingly magnificent interior and works of art.",
          "After visiting the Tourist Information we decided to walk around the Basilica. It is huge, incredibly ornate and elegant. It is not covered with gold like many of these over the top places, but uses more woods and stones to make religious statements. We also paid the 3\u20ac to go",
          "This is a very famous basilica visited and attended by all the locals especially during La Fiesta del Pilar (the local festivities). The simple detail outside hides a work of art inside. Simply stunning (my 2 year old did find it a little scary though).",
          "This basilica is super impressive. Lots to see including where the bombs had landed in the ceiling during wartime. The basilica is huge so take your time to explore it. Make sure you take the lift to the viewing area in the tower. The entrance to the tower is a little tricky to",
          "This church is absolutely gorgeous. The entire plaza there was amazing. Pictures aren't allowed inside which was great because it meant I HAD to take it all in JUST FOR ME! It's beauty and peaceful energy a memory for myself.",
          "Beautiful Basilica and friendly people around. Highly recommend to see before before going to Barcelona !",
          "Located at the Zaragoza, a small place by Erbo river the longest river of Spain 930km. The building was damaged from the 1954 war but the bomb did not detonate. The interior was beautifully decorated. There are also lots to see outside the basilica.",
          "A wonderful experience. Our Summer trip entailed visiting as many holy and spiritual sites as possible. This was another one of those experiences where we could sit quietly and enjoy the spiritual feeling of being in the presence of Christ.",
          "Free to enter with magnificent interior. You have to see the inside but just the view of the exterior is amazing and I am not religious!",

          "This is the most incredible Cathedral that I have seen so far. It is absolutely huge and the detail to the interior is significant. Whether your religious or not, this is well and truly worth a visit!! Free entry",
          "This was one of the very few cathedrals/churches that we encountered in Spain that did not charge an entrance fee, and because of that it was one of the very few that we visited. It is beautiful on the outside, a very imposing structure, the dominant building in the Plaza del",
          "Most of this basilica is fairly standard, though it is quite large. The most notable features are the exterior, which is roughly like a mosque in general outline, with a center dome and four towers (instead of minarets); and an extra chapel in the rear. The chapel is very",
          "starting from 12th october for a week there is a flower tower in front of the basilica. there is no entrance fee. afternoons service as held but is is also open for tourists. there are great art artifacts such as marbel carvings and paintings inside. inside there is a column",
          "I don't usually rate catholic churches. I am not even catholic. But when you enter this church you are immediately in awe. Its actually 2 churches, each very different. The main has a huge organ and as incredible altar. The smaller one has a huge, curved roof of gold.",
          "Traveling through Portugal and Spain we saw so many churches, monasteries, etc. This one was different in coloring as well as the ceiling in the entry room. Beautiful paintings on the ceiling and beautiful sculptures leading up to them.",
          "Boring from the inside, really nothing special. The Tower and the exterior are the interesting parts.",
          "It is a very brilliant Basilica in Zaragoza, very beautiful both inside and outside. However, it is so grand that it is not easy to take pictures of the whole building from the front. It is better to take pictures from the Stone Bridge behind the Basilica.",
          "It is spectacular inside and out. I read that there is a pillar in the church and the Virgin is said to have descended from heaven onto the pillar in an apparition to St. James the Apostle by the banks of the Ebro River. She gave him a small wooden statue of herself and a column",
          "The exterior of the cathedral is impressive, especially when illuminated at night. The inside is elaborately decorated in very intense, dark colors. For us, the overall effect was depressing.",
          "It is so good to see this palace! I was really trying to understand how did this syone craft workers did that ornaments on pillows.",
          "The towers are impressive and it draws your attention and pulls you towards it. The exterior is impressive, but when I walked inside I was awed by the ornate detail, the wood carvings, the massive columns, the domed ceilings, the way that the stone and wood come together in an",
          "Beautiful inside and out. Situated by the River Ebro. Free to go in, but 3 Euros to go up the tower in the lift, but well worth it for the view!",
          "With Hoya paintings, this large basilica is a must see in Zaragoza. The plaza in front of it is impressive and its and easy walk down the shopping Avenue to the El Tubo tapas area. Take the elevator ride up the tower",
          "There are many Basilicas in the world. This doesn\u2019t make top 10 but still worth a visit. It lacks details and particulars, not sure if you know what I mean. It feels dull, flat, imperfect, something is missing. The colored roofs don\u2019t make it any better either, I think this is",
          "Had great expectations of visiting the basilica and would have been more than happy to pay a fee in lieu of information of the history. (Think they\u2019ve missed a trick here). All over the place were posters advising no photos to be taken no back packs etc. Yet there was no",
          "Not as grand as some of the others is Spain, but still worth a walk through. Outside has great artwork.",
          "One of the few nice cathedrals in Spain, still in use that makes it special. Shame to skipp if you are around",
          "Never seen anything like this before, well worth a visit. Gets quite busy but a must see when in Zaragoza.",
          "I'm told you are not allowed to insult the cathedral to any Zaragozians, but I don't think you would need to! It is a more modern building created around an ancient one, but it has been very beautifully done. It is busy, but not terribly so, and is a huge space with plenty to",
          "Free to get in and what an amazing building. Well worth a visit and walk around to see such a historic building.",
          "One of the few freely accessible cathedrals we visited on our tour of Spain. Huge dimensions, not my favourite but also place of devotion dedicated to an appearance of Mother Mary. Fits well with the huge open square before it",
          "The tourists can see only a very small part of the cathedral. The entrance is free of charge. Nice building from the inside and outside.",
          "The Basilica in Zaragoza to St, Pilar ,is craftmans work at it best. You could not but feel awe and majesty of the building, Do not miss it. Look for the lift at one corner, and view Zaragoza fron on High.",
          "Very informative and beautiful. Plan at least 90 minutes. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy peacefully.",
          "We visited the cathedral as it\u2019s presence is clear throughout the whole of the city and so we thought it would only be right to see it from the inside. Although I am not overly religious I could appreciate the beautiful intricacies of the cathedral. Obviously being a religious",
          "Nice and interesting visit in this huge, modern cathedral. Although no photos are allowed, interesting place to check architecture and religious art.",
          "The Cathedral-Basilica for our Lady of the Pillar is a Roman Catholic situated along the banks of the Ebro river. It has a colourful ceramic tiles on top of the dome. Unfortunately, not enough time to see the inside of the Cathedral.",
          "One of the most amazing cathedrals I have ever saw. Its architecture is simply outstanding and the peace you feel while you are in is memorable. The murals and frescos from Francisco de Goya, the monumental pipe organ - you definetely need to pay it a visit.",
          "Amazingly large. Very busy and so easy to get to, just follow the signs. Easy and good value parking in the Plaza in front. Lots to see inside including a couple of bombs dropped during the civil war, not at all expected.",
          "I would say that historically Santiago de Compostela's church in Galicia is Spain's most important church but I without doubt would say that the most beautiful is the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar. It's soaring bell towers and domes of colored tiles force visitor's eyes",
          "You can't drive into Zaragoza and miss this Basilica. While we didn't have time to go in the architecture is spectacular and we certainly took the photo opportunity. If the outside is this good the inside is well worth it. We were passing through on our way to Bilbao and will",
          "With a beautiful architecture from the outside at first sight it gives an impression of some small castle with stunning tombs. Once you enter this church it stunns you further with it\u2019s arches, paintings and wood carving work. It holds a mother Mary pillar which is believed to",
          "Beautiful cathedral with impressive construction details, both outside and inside. Excellent for christians believers. In the middle of the city.",

          "Beautiful place to visit, amazing view. Situated in a very nice square ,a very nice area . June was a very nice time to visit.",
          "As impressive inside as outside. There are no words to describe. Tried to take pictures, but they are as miserable as any words in trial to describe :) During our stay we were getting back several times, and it was still not enough. If Saragossa is not on your route, worth",
          "The Basilica is located on a walking promenade where you\u2019ll enjoy visiting the Church. The location is great, where you will easily find restaurants and cafes parallel to the church. Get your self a drink or a cup of coffee and enjoy the surroundings that takes you back in",
          "It\u2019s a really big Basilic, quite impressive. It has lots of story. I really recommend a organized visit",
          "I\u2019ve been to hundreds of churches through the world including St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome. Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Piler is the second most beautiful Basilica next to St. Peter\u2019s. Yes, it\u2019s a functional Catholic Church, services are held throughout the day and We were",

          "According to legend St. James saw a vision of the BVM who instructed him to build a church with a pillar she gave him. So the original church harks back to the 1st or 2nd century AD. Unfortunately it and subsequent churches have come and gone and the one that is standing now is",

          "Just amazing and impressive Cathedral s design Worth whatever amount of time you could allocate to visit it Outside is also interesting and if you dont like it, one of the best tapas street in Zaragoza takes off from the square",
          "great place, very well maintained, charming, and dont miss to take the elevator to the top. Amazing view",
          "Worth the visit, fabulous, we also went up to one the towers, fantastic experience with a stupendous view.",

          "What to say . One of the best experience in Spain . And I ve seen C\u00f3rdoba , Barcelona , Sevilla etc . Cathedral is amazing and worth going to the tower to see the view .",
          "We were underwhelmed really. Disappointed as the atmosphere was not really spiritual. To think that St Ignatius was there was helpful.",
          "We were en route to Barcelona and had a stop at Zaragoza for half a day. The Basilica is worth the visit. Can park across the river at a free car park or at Plaza de Pilar. Amazing church and can spend 1-3 hrs easily, especially if the weather is good.",
          "Zaragoza , you need to definitely stop in La Basilica de la virgen del Pilar , the church is simply amazing , we are of faith so for us as a family was important",
          "Take the elevator in the rear left tower to an amazing viewpoint over the whole city. Absolutely stunning! The roof tiles are worth it alone.",
          "This is a fantastic landmark and an amazing building, but fells almost more like an railway station than a cathedral, maybe it's the brick architecture... so huge on the inside that it is a rather impersonal space.",
          "Park your car in the underground parking at Plaza del Pilar and as you surface from the gloom this wonderful building is the first thing you see and worth it with its 11 brightly coloured tiled cupolas.",
          "Free entrance into thai beautiful basilica. The copolas are impressive and the peacefulness of it are nice in a bustling city. No pictures allowed or hats, cell phone use etc.",
          "It's a monster of a church mostly in barock style with strange neo classic pillars in the inside, with mess and all the hokuspokus all day long, the best thing is the one tower in the back where you can go up with an elevator which gives a wonderful view of the city",
          "Considered one of the main attractions in Zaragoza, this Basilica is huge! Dare i say almost a city block (short block) long. While visiting, there was a small chapel within holding a mass. A number of Patrons in attendance since Spain is still a very Catholic stronghold. Many",
          "I personally loved this basil. It's really pretty, it has got a Russian style when it comes to architectonic speech. It is big and it has something that makes you feel at home, I strongly recommend it",

          "Before coming to Zaragoza we had read that this was a wonderful building; and we certainly found this to be true. We were - and still are - bowled over by its beauty, especially the exterior. Despite its great size, the Basilica is not heavy or imposing. People from all over",
          "The Plaza is wonderful and as the largest building this Basilica makes an impressive contribution to the architecture. The coloured tiles and some of the detailing on the front elevation is wonderful. However inside it is cavernous and lacks atmosphere; there are a series of",

          "Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar rivals some of the most famous and beautiful cathedrals and churches in Europe. The glory and power of the Catholic Church in Spain, particularly during the time of the Holy Roman Empire, is fully evident here. Constructed largely in the 16th",

          "And we were so lucky. We were there on a day when an annual public event, the celebration of (as best we understood it) first responders (civil guard, military, ambulance etc). Military bands, presentations, singing, public speaking and awarding, all lovingly took place in",
          "This basilica is one of nicest I\u2019ve seen. For visitors only a third of it was avalable but it\u2019s worth it to have a look inside. Sadly, no pictures are allowed inside.",
          "Bas\u00edlica close to the Ebro river which is Zaragoza\u2019s landmark. Can be seen when entering the city from the north. Building is not the most ancient building in Zaragoza, first steps built in XIII and it has need refurbished many times. Last time in XX. Is a must visiting",

          "Huge venue, very popular/busy, atmospheric. Without trying to be dis-respectful, this would make a terrific location for a Star Wars palace. Stunning architecture. Only negative: electric candles, makes offerings to loved one seem a little commercial. A must see in Zaragoza -",
          "We didn't get a tour, but enjoyed walking around both outside and in. There was a noon service in the small chapel we got to watch.",
          "The big church is a mix of styles and periods. You can take pictures and strolling around in silence because there are ceremonies at the weekend. I was looking for the statue of Mary but it is quite small..so follow the people to find it...the light all around is",

          "We came here at a time when a service was in. Then organ is amazing. Like most European church\u2019s it\u2019s beautiful inside. You could feel the guilt. Worth the walk around.",
          "This is probably the prettiest place in the city and the view from the bridge next to it is just lovely. It is particularly nice to see at night. Entry is free - photos are not allowed inside, but it is nice just to soak up the experience without documenting",

          "So much of European history is told in the large cathedrals in the old cities. And this is certainly no exception. You wonder how they built these magnificent edifices then with zero of the technology or mechanics we have today. But they not only built them but they built them",

          "You cannot miss it when you go to Zaragoza and you should not. Going inside is a plus but just the outside is very nice and well maintained. Good part of the history of Zaragoza.",
          "Visited this place on the way to Barcelona from Madrid. Took the 8.30 am train from Madrid and arrived at 9.45 am. We left our luggages at the locker. From the train station just took a taxi to the Basilica. We were amazed with the size and beauty of this Basilica. Managed",
          "Truly a massive building from the outside but surprised me when I walked in. It\u2019s huge. Beautiful with lots of history. To get the most out of your visit...do your research first.",
          "This Church is impressive in size and has loads of history on the inside. Highly recommend having a guide or reading about the church upon entering. Goya painted a couple of the interior domes, the locals try to guess what color of The Maddonas dress will be that day so they can",
          "The visit is free, and a definite must when in Zaragoza. The floors and columns are all marble, while the ceilings and the many domes are all decorated with frescoes. It was trully impressive, to a certain extent more so than St Paul's in London. Mass was being held in one of",
          "This is the landmark for Zaragoza. If you come to the city you have to take time to experience the beauty and history of this basilica. It's free too, so that is a plus!",

          "Impressive church, inside and out. The coloured tiles on the rooftop and the \u201ctemple inside a temple\u201d for La Pilar make it special. Be aware: no picture taking allowed inside. There is also an elevator you can take for 3E up the tower on the northwest side.",
          "One night stopover and had time to visit. Huge Basilica on the banks of the river. Well worth a visit. Lovely promenade by the side of the river and plenty of bars & cafes around",

          "We were fortunate enough to visit the Basilica on Palm Sunday. Mass was being conducted and the church was full. Lit, the massive cathedral could not fail to impress. The Goyas were fabulous and each of the small chapels worth lingering. A site not to be missed.",
          "We visited the Basilica whilst in Zaragoza and it was beautiful and impressive. These was a service at the time which added depth and meaning to our visit. One of the highlights of our time there.",
          "Definitely worth a visit to be impressed by the size and architecture. Fascinating even if you aren't religious.",
          "One of the main attractions and worth a visit. The lift wasn\u2019t easy to find I had to ask twice. The church is open all day but be aware that the view from the top for which you use the lift closes at 2pm. I think it re-opens again after 4 but you might need to check. Lovely",
          "Good to visit it. Lots to discover and learn. Majestically fronting the Rio Ebro, the basilica de nuestra senora del polar is one of the Spain's greatest and most revered religious buildings.",

          "We visited many cathedrals in Spain and this was, by far, our favorite. Lots of details to get lost in and a great place to understand the rich history behind the city. The place also offers a ride up to one of the main towers for 3\u20ac/person with some of the best views.",
          "One of the best cathedrals I ever saw - rivaling Vatican or London. Note 2 unexplored bombs inside from Civil war times",
          "Amazing, beautiful, splendid, grandiose from the inside and outside! Its beautiful at night and during the day! I cant even tell you how pretty it is with snow covering it!",
          "Famous for housing \u201cour lady of pillar \u201c the icon of Mary. Special religious ceremony in October but minor services take place daily. Massive edifice, well worth a visit. Don\u2019t miss the views from the ascenseur( \u20ac3 fee).",
          "We stopped over in Zaragoza to visit the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar on our way from Bilbao to Barcelona. This Basilica is the main reason to visit Zaragoza and the fact that it was Palm Sunday was a bonus! The Basilica is simply wonderful!!! It is one of the most",
          "The first place you need to visit is The Basilica, it is beautiful, history to its best, you must see the statue of the Virgin del Pilar",
          "The basilica is very impressive. It dominates the skyline of the city and has a lot of beautiful features such as the towers and the coloured rooftiles. Inside is a massive space, of which the functions are not always clear. The real sanctuary is a smaller structure built inside",
          "You do not need to see the Basilica just if you are Catholic... in fact no mater if you have no religion or God at all you must see it because the fine art's work and beautiful details inside are something that you can not miss. Remember you can not make pictures inside, but",
          "If you ares near Zaragoza you must stop here. There is no charge to tour the Cathedral. The detail is incredible, the frescoes and statues are amazing. Don't miss this!!",

          "An amazing experience right from the time you get inside, a nice place worth the visit. This place was part of my day tour of town",
          "I\u2019m the type of person who likes to swing by churches to enjoy the architecture, but I\u2019m not one to stick around long. I felt similarly about this one, but I would say there\u2019s something special about this massive Basilica. The roof was particularly lovely and I don\u2019t regret",
          "Absolutely amazing architecture, paintings and history. Very peaceful... You should definitely go and see if you are in Zaragoza. Just take if you want to take pics....its not allowed and they will yell at you:)",
          "Now, it\u2019s a difficult review to write about a Cathedral as \u2018what do you say?\u2019. However, Pilar has something of an aura and reputation about it, and the air and stories of miracles are well reputed. I\u2019m a Catholic so it was natural for me to visit. Several people I\u2019ve been with,",
          "Beautiful basilica with lots of history. Nice and detailed master pieces like paintings and figures Really nice to visit",
          "This Basilica is definitely worth a visit in Zaragoza. It is spectacular and huge! Wonderful art, one part made by Goya which is really amazing.",
          "Spectacular church with lots of flags and military presence in it (including franquiste glorification of air bombers -probably on Barcelona!). It is free so pay a visit to remember how pompous can be high catholicism!",
          "We stayed right across the river in Ibis Centro and it was an easy 20 min walk to this cathedral . There was a fair on the square in front of the cathedral selling cheese , churros, trinkets etc . The architecture of the cathedral was awe inspiring . Definitely worth an hour",
          "The Catedral was amazing, so many history I felt such a good feeling, I been to many Catedral before but the Basilica Del Pilar Was gorgeous, the day I visit they have a giant flower mountain I loved so much Zaragoza and I planned to go back next year A lot to see",
          "The Basilica is a stunning structure from the outside but once you go in the art is magnificent. Get ready with your euros to see Goya's work on the ceiling lighted. Go around slowly and immerse yourself in the basilica's beauty but take time to pray and light some candles for",
          "A tourist destination that you should not miss, a huge church with mixed architectural styles, a place of worship where history has left undeniable traces. The church tower offers a wonderful view of the city.",
          "The moment I stepped into the grand, large sized basilica, I could not help but think of St. Peter\u2019s. It is quite an exclamation of a place of worship. Neoclassical and lots of gold and brass to get me into the Advent mood. If you are in Zaragoza, there is nothing else to see.",
          "A super large super impressive place. Would rival many a Roman church but has its own unique and appealing style. A must see.",
          "What a massive building, very impressive inside and out. The present church begun in 1681 by Charles II, King of Spain and completed in 1686.",
          "Basilica is located in old part of city on the Ebro river bank on one side and the Plaza de las Catedrales on the other. Magnificent outside and breathtaking inside this Basilica on the right can be considered one of the most beautiful constructions in the world. Open daily and",
          "There are many cathedrals in Spain, but this one - with 4 towers on each corner and with splendid interior, frescos and Holy Pilar is of special significance. We have visited it 3 times during a 2-days stay in Zaragoza, each time finding some new details. It is so spectacular",
          "Well worth a visit. No cameras or noise please. Guided tours available but not necessary to appreciate the basilica",
          "This huge cathedral is really beautiful from the outside with its semi-Moorish dome design. There's also a ceiling painted by Goya inside. It's not as elaborate as another nearby Cathedral called La Seo but the real highlight is a trip up the bell tower to give you a 360",
          "This is an extremely large basilica with stunning altars, ceiling frescos and stained windows. The size alone is awe inspiring. There are 6 cupolas and 4 towers. The domes are beautifully carved and also have coloured mosaic tile trim. It is a \u201cmust see\u201d even if you think you",
          "A beautiful basilica in the heart of Zaragoza. Definitely a must-see. Such a shame photos are forbidden!",
          "Incredibly big and as I have read it is the second biggest cathedral in the world. It is in the heart of Zaragoza and if you are in the city, you have to visit.",
          "This is a great place to visit. It is vast inside and there is so much to see. There is also 2 unexploded bombs on the wall. 3 bombs were dropped on Zaragoza 1 went off. The other 2 landed on the Basilica but failed to explode.",
          "Dominating the main square, a visit to this huge basilica is unavoidable if you are in Zaragoza. Don\u2019t waste your time queuing to see the pillar after which the basilica is named. It is a now, smoothed price of stone that has been kissed a bit too much!",
          "The basilica is the main reason many pilgrims come to Zaragoza but it is less impressive in the inside than many other churches in Spain",
          "Very large Cathedral - Basilica. 8000 kvm2 Incredible decorated. Possible to get an elevator up to one of the towers for 3\u20ac",
          "Spanish catholicism in all of it's glory, WHILE mass is being held on Sunday morning. Perfect! The relationship between the King and the church is physically present for historians to see and witness.",
          "Having visited Notre Dame less than 2 weeks earlier, my wife and I thought that this cathedral is even more impressive! Truly spectacular.",
          "Indeed , a very beautiful cathedral with quite a sense of hustle and bustle inside with the many tourists inside, me being one of them!",
          "Lovely experience. Really enjoyed our visit to the Basilica. Well worth a look inside and feel the atmosphere.",
          "You will go for the \"tapas\" trip but be prepared to spend the rest of the night. Lot of places to choose from. Beer, wine, you name it you can find it there. On the down side, it could get really crowded.",
          "The sheer scale of this cathedral is breath-taking. Frescoes; stained glass; murals; domed ceilings; altar-pieces ... There are signs everywhere stating no photographs, or videos, think that I must have been only person in cathedral adhering to this instruction! Entrance to the",
          "We have visited some large cathedrals, but the best word to describe this one is huge. It is quite open and spacious inside, with something interesting to see most everywhere you look. You should visit the Puente de Piedra for a good view of cathedral from the rear. It is",
          "Top sight in Zaragoza for a reason. It is just the most vast Church - so vast it\u2019s hard to find a vantage point even in a huge square in front to get the whole thing in a photo. From the outside it looks more like a Palace with coloured tiles and almost minaret-like towers. If",
          "Fantastic basilica. Only wished there was a little bit more information provided or guides available to buy. It is free so I guess that\u2019s why info is lacking. Would really recommend going up the tower-beautiful views of the city!",
          "Very beautiful and impressive. It is huge and super well preserved. Definitely worth a visit if you are near Zaragoza.",
          "Very large and impressive cathedral. Very easy to find - just head for the river! Definitely a must see attraction for any visitor to Zaragoza. Free entry though there is a small charge if you want to take the glass fronted lift which gives spectacular views over the city",
          "This cathedral is very very large, also it awes me. I think that is what they are supposed to do, but this one more than the others. It's a great shame they only have electric candles, it's not the same as the real ones. Otherwise it is well worth the visit to Zaragoza",
          "Beautiful cathedral just metres away from our hotel. It is beautiful inside and outside. And the free entry is a bonus!",
          "It's an impressive building but I personally struggled with the atmosphere on the inside. Definitely one of the coldest spots in Zaragoza in summer though.",
          "It would be foolish to not visit here while in Zaragoza. The scale is astonishing! Incredible chapels, domes, and famous Goya cupolas inside. Home to the miracle virgin statue which sits in the main chapel and emits a holiness that is palpable. The outside is magnificent at",
          "Very impressive basillica covering a wide area. Worth going over the bridge halfway to get a good look at the roof. Lots of cafes along the side of the basilica plus 2 impressive water features st either end of the area.",

          "Cathedral is a must when visiting Zaragoza. Center of the city on the Ebro River. Interesting history.",
          "The Basilica is huge - someone had likened it to a football pitch and I can see why. It It's quite light inside and some of the altars are very ornate. There was a service taking place so we didn't linger in half the Basilica- unlike some who were whistling to catch their",
          "A really impressive building and so large, the chiming of the bells is wonderful. Lots of opportunities for pics and enjoy. The square is magnificent with water feature and a chance to watch the whole world go by.",

          "Now one of my favorites in Europe! Free entrance, can't take pictures. Children can get a picture with Our Lady of the Pilar, taken by a photographer, mailed to your home (smallest package is 18\u20ac). You can kneel and touch/venerate the pilar in which Our Lady appeared. Small gift",
          "The children enjoyed frolicking in the fountains, beautiful place for a wine or beer to pass an hour away.",

          "Beautiful basilica in a large, impressive square. The Moorish influence is very apparent. The architecture and the outside decoration are beautiful.",
          "We spent about 30 minutes in the church. The interior was amazing. Highly recommend taking the time to visit this beautiful basilica.",
          "Given it's a Basilica it's not surprising it's big but it felt like three churches in one and had little atmosphere as a result. However from the outside it's truly amazing. I think they should give up the plastic candles - go back to real ones and add atmosphere.",
          "Beautiful building inside and out. A must to visit when staying in Zaragoza. Sit outside in one of the cafes having a drink and enjoy the view of the Basilica. It is just stunning.",

          "One lf the greatest churches I have ever seen. Definently worth the visit. You definently see where Aragons riches went at the time",
          "I did not go in the church, but the square is beautiful, as is the building from the outside. I was there in the beginning of the evening and the lighting is beautiful.",
          "The outside of the building is splendid and most impressive, set on the square. The inside was to me disappointing particularly the electric candles rather made it look like a commercial opportunity than a place of worship.",
          "We love old churches and cathedrals so this was a must see. Down to the shrine to \"our lady\" and the Goya relief on one part of the ceiling. The usual wander around all the different chapesl and interesting to watch a service whilst tourists like us mingled with the congregation",

          "One of the most beautiful in Europe. It s impressive from outside and magnificent inside. The mess is a unique experience",
          "Fantastic building especially from the outside. Not the most impressive inside - big, cavernous but not Notre Dame/Sacre Couer/the Duoma/St Peters etc but still worthy of a peak. Best thing though is the view from the tower, a must. Only 3 euro and we were the only ones up there",
          "The wood and stone craftsmanship is very impressive. The included audio guide is very informative. The plaza outside is also very nice to sit and enjoy.",

          "Zaragoza is off the tourist trail but stop for a night if you can. Stay in the city at the Alfonso or Gaya Hotels. Make the short walk to the Pla\u00e7a Pilar and the Basilica. For such a small town the history is amazing. Catch the Basilica early in the morning or at dusk for best",
          "I wish I had seen the previous review that mentioned the elevator up the tower. Hopefully there will be another visit here in the future. This is one beautiful cathedral. Admission is free but I would gladly pay to visit. Some sections were closed while we were there, but",
          "El Pilar is absolutely beautiful, and if you enjoy art and architecture, you will want to spend quite a while making your way around the building. General entrance is free; you can pay 3 euros to see a small relic museum inside, but in my opinion this one room display is",
          "We visited on Easter Sunday,the Church is huge,the biggest we've ever seen,amazing architecture,beautiful ceilings and decorations. A must see.",
          "The Pilar is a magnificent building, especially seen from outside by the old bridge but also inside. We did not find information explaining history or art inside but it can be looked up before or after. We only spent 20 minutes inside and did not check if towers could be visited",
          "One of the biggest baroque churches on Earth - definitely worth visiting, even if you are not a fan of this era in the art history.",
          "Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra se\u00f1ora del Pilar looking so beautiful. Big problem is to get photo without people. You have to do that before ten o'clock",
          "Spanish baroque church interiors are a bit of an acquired taste, as, befitting their new-world el dorado empire, gold is very much a theme, and there is absolutely no such thing as over-ornate. I find they tend to work best, though, in a more austere building, so that there is",
          "A truly spectacular basilica. Don't miss going up the tower. It has wonderful views of the river below and the countryside around the whole city",
          "The scale of this, vast, baroque extravaganza of a church is mind-blowing. It dominates the city centre, and particularly its side of the River Ebro with a riot of towers, turrets and finials. It's an emphatic testament of Marian devotion, and seems to underpin the local",
          "An absolutely incredible place to visit. It seemed very popular with locals and tourists alike and the size and beauty of the ouside, and even more so the inside, was there for all to see. It is clearly a place of great spiritual importance but equally can be appreciated by",
          "Have to see to appreciate this magnificent monument...right on the river and a beauty to behold. Make sure to visit !",
          "Huge atmospheric Cathedral full of history, in the centre of the old quarter by the river and all of the other attractions.",
          "This place is huge and simply stunning . Be sure to read up about the bombs on the wall that were dropped during the civil war but did not explode , the holes they made are still visible if you look upwards as the repairs are very visible .",
          "By 3 euro, you'll be able to go to one of the tower. Please do so. The view is amazing. Don't worry about the wind, it has glass wall all over",
          "Fabulously decorated and relaxed officialiadom. There are signs discoriging shorts and bla bla but there was no sign of police. The lift and climb to the top of the the tower is well worth while.",
          "A massive building with a lot of interesting architecture, numerous different areas with differing murals. Plenty of interesting artefacts for most people to enjoy even if you are not that religious.",
          "Imposing Christian temple of baroque style next to the river Ebro. Its dimensions are surprising and are enhanced when approaching. Its interior also pleases the decoration and marbles of the floor.",
          "The basilica is an amazing building and includes paintings from famous painters including Goya. Its possible to go to the top of one of the towers and enjoy the beautiful views.",
          "Stunning architecture and mind blowing proportions - the exterior alone is worth a visit to Zaragoza. Make sue to see the views of the city from the 100m tower (elevator for initial 75m).",
          "We visited the monument on a sunny day. The view was awesome. With tiled roof the Basilica just looked magnificent. Inside also it is not only huge but very beautiful. Each part requires lot of time to see. The Basilica looks good when seen from the old bridge on river. It is a",
          "The Basilica de Pilar is very beautiful. It's a must see. You can also go to the top of the tower to get the best views of Zaragoza.",
          "We entered a church while going mass inside. I am nt sure what to say, is basilica better outside or inside, day was wonderful afternoon so pictures I took are awesome.",
          "The \"Wow\" effect is there as soon as you push the door. One need at least two weeks or so to get a clear picture of each and every part of the Cathedral. So beautiful no word can describe it.",
          "The Basilica celebrates mass seemingly every hour on Sundays. There is also 2 masses on Friday night. The Basilica is the largest church. The inside is beautiful, but there are no English guide books. The tiles on the roof are of Muslim influence (yes, on a Roman Catholic",

          "Open all day and every day this is the highlight of Zaragoza and entrance is free. Take time to look closely at the artwork and don't be rushed because there is so much to take in. I just wished we could have got a guided tour to get the full benefit of the amazing art and",
          "Very impressive church in the center of the city. The outside is pretty at night, I'd recommend seeing it at night from across the river.",
          "I found the exterior more attractive than the interior, which is expansive but in some places rather gloomy. The ambiance was enhanced by the service taking place at noon. Some remarkable architecture inside and outside. Lovely coloured tiled roofs.",
          "Lived near here for 3 years, a beautiful sight inside and out. Worth a visit and then an ice-cream in the plaza!",
          "Wonderful basilica blending different architecture styles. It is the primary attraction in Zaragoza. We were told that the original small church built on this site was destroyed, and it took about 300 years to complete the current structure in the 1960's. Admission is free and",
          "The church has a great architecture. I didn't manage to see inside but the outer architecture is amazing.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous, do go inside. It's one of the most spectacular churches I've ever seen. Unfortunately, they don't let you take pictures inside, but it's still very worth visiting.",
          "I previously declared the cathedral in Salamanca to be the most beautiful in Europe. Today I visited the cathedral in Zaragoza and may have changed my mind. This is on spectacular cathedral, not to be missed if you have a chance to visit it.",
          "Beautiful and full of history - definitely worth the time. No pictures allowed and wonderful experience.",
          "Even if you are not a religious person, this cathedral is one-of-a-kind. The history behind and the art within (Goya e.g.) are simply breathtaking. This monument is regrettably underrated. It should be one of the \"must-see\" atractions not only in Spain but also in Europe.",
          "This place is one of the absolute highlights of zaragoza with its astonishing architecture, rich interior and particular identity , set in a very nice zone of the city . Entrance free",
          "This is THE place to visit...for its history and meaning. The roofs are seen from far and away and the tilework, characteristic and wonderful. Inside...it is huge...so there is no feeling of coziness but of grandieur. The main altar to Virgin of Pilar (or 'Pilarica') is THE best",
          "This is a very nice baroque-style Basilica and well worth a visit. It's free to enter but in order to have a chance to walk around and see it all, you should plan your visit to avoid the mass times (which are quite frequent!). The hours are posted at the entrance. The",
          "It is one of the best known of the Spanish churches. A very large building. Nice interior and impressive silhouette. Try having a look at it from the oposite side of the Ebro river.",
          "just go and marvel at how they built this impressive building which is free to enter then pay the 3 euros and go up the tower and take in the views a must see",
          "This is a stunning Basilica with a multi-colored, tile roof. It has four corner towers and you can take an elevator up one of them to see some stunning views of the city and the Basilica from above. If you want, you can climb a few flights of stairs for an even better view.",
          "Come and marvel at the size and eloquence of this basilica and lose yourself in the complex interplay of the architectural styles. Definitely a must see in Zaragoza!",
          "The basilica is the main symbol of Zaragoza and it's beautiful as the central piece of the city. Inside there's plenty of saints to worship and you can walk around for 20 min without a problem. However it's more stoic from the outside and the church bells are worth listening",
          "This building is stunning inside and out. No charge to visit, and there are treasures within. An absolute must-do if you're in Zaragoza, it's on the main square and is awesome.",
          "the only place in zaragoza I realy enjoyed. make sure you visit this place at night after 9pm. there are many restaurants across this place that yo seat outside drink your wine and enjoy the magnificent view. also take a short walk to the bridge on the river where you panoramic",

          "I did like the basilica but the same as the other spanish churches. The outside at sundown is impressive with those towers especially looking at then from river Ebro",
          "We saw the cathedral at night first. It was beautifully lit. Fascinating interior and good to be able to see it when a service is in progress.",
          "This is the top must first cultural visit in Saragossa. It is the emblem of the city and one of the most impressive religious temples in Spain.",
          "This is soo much more then the Notre Dame of anything else. See the majestic building from the bridge over the Ebro first and then visit the inside. Find the bombs that fell through the roof but never exploded :)",
          "The interior of the Basilica is absolutely stunning. It's massive as well. You can still enter during Mass, but only on the right side of the building. There are a lot of children and babies here. They all line up to have a photo (and be blessed?). It's of Catholic spiritual",
          "we arrived on Pilar holiday and I really recommend to visit Zaragoza this time to feel the soul of the city",

          "Impressive basilica and piazza you should not miss to visit during a stay in zaragoza. There are many bars around to sit outside and get inspired by this massive building",
          "Absolutely incredible, a rival to St Peters in scale and grandeur. Well worth a visit and free entrance. Easy to find",
          "We came to see the fiesta del pilar and were mesmerized by the beauty of the traditional costumes, the mountain of flowers and the cathedral itself",
          "Wonderful Church full of character , should be seen. Worth walking around the whole church. Wonderful paintings and sculptures.",
          "While internal photos are not permitted, my memories of various parts of this magnificent church will remain with me forever. Basilica de Nuestro Se\u00f1ora del Pilar sits between the Rio Ebro and the equally magnificent plaza Plaza del Catedrales. The Basilica is composed of a",
          "Legend has it that the Virgin Mary came to this spot and placed a pillar on it. There is a special shrine to this pillar, and it is a sacred spot for devout Catholics. The church is truly beautiful; there are many capellas enriched with silver and gold dedicated to saints",
          "A good way to spend a couple of hours both inside and out. They do Gothic architecture big style in Spain.",
          "Basilica itself was amazing. Stunning architecture. It's still active and we were lucky to be there while a service was taking place. We liked their \"electronic candles\" approach - some might find it un-traditional, but I though it was great from an environmental perspective.",
          "A very interesting building. Take some time to lean about the history to fully appreciate your visit. I would suggest visiting at different times of day. During the day the basilica is open to the public and there are several masses that you can join in or just watch. It is then",
          "Sit in the magnificent plaza and feast your eyes on this building, truly stunning both day and night when lit up. However be prepared for the inside. Not great and personally found it dreary and uninspiring. Try to make Saturday to be there. Its wedding day, at least 6 brides",
          "Just visiting only this cathedral worth coming to Zaragoza. It was the first church where I saw small electric bulbs instead of candles.",
          "best views from the opposite bank of the river Ebro. square in fromt of the basilica is very touristic.",
          "Beautiful place for prayer, inspiring story with miraculous events taking place, bombs not exploding, healings and all this from the beginning of the Christianity, nearly 2000 years old devotions!",
          "This cathedral totally dominates the large square and creates a magnificent cityscape and public space there. But inside it is strangely divided into smaller spaces than one would expect, none really impressive. A true connoisseur may find much to admire but for the average",
          "free to go in amazing building inside and out loads of chapels within art work and carvings a must to see",
          "An amazing place, it's ornate, it's diverse. Origins and history, it's been built over centuries trying to out do the other cathedral in Zaragoza, this place dominates Zaragoza and is the centre of th best festivals, I'm not overly religious but love this site and Zaragoza for",

          "Totally different in design than any other cathedrals we visited. Stands majestic with its colorful domes and pillars. You could even spot the site from a distance on the A 2 highway. We were there end of the daylight and we also saw it when lights came on in the dark. Even",
          "We stopped in Zaragoza in the later afternoon to break up our drive from Barcelona to San Sebastian. The Basilica so dominated the skyline of the city that it made the GPS unnecessary. In a word, the exterior is striking.... different from any duomo or basilica that I can recall",
          "Very nice, large roofline with some color. The main alter is very impressive. No photos , supposedly allowed. First church given to Mary. Reasonable places to eat in plaza in front of church. Nice.",
          "If you are visiting for religious reasons, the Pilar will no doubt meet your expectations. From a cultural point of view, there may be some elements of architectural or artistic interest here, but they are so swamped in religiosity that it is impossible to appreciate them.",
          "This location is full of shopping and cafe's. I noticed at 8pm that the church bells would ring, and they would play a choir singing. It was very nice.. There are multiple bell towers in the same square, so they politely have them offset so they don't all ring at the same",
          "The place is huge. And free. So whats not to like? It is easy to forget that this is a church (with people praying) and not just a tourist attraction - some tourists were actually taking photos of the priests doing mass (which the security guards did not like! And is very",
          "You can book a tour or take an unescorted walk around. We chose the latter and loved it. The basilica is rich in history and tells a very long story of Zaragoza's occupancy. The chruch community is obvioulsy strong and adds a liveliness and vibrance to anyone fortunate enough to",
          "Get ready to see Goya in its best! I am speechless and when you are done walk East 100 ye=ards to a GOYA Museum, what a treat!",

          "The exterior of this massive structure may be 18thc brickwork, but the effect on the modernised Plaza del Pilar is stunning - especially when lit at night. The big attraction for devout Catholics is the opportunity to kiss the Pilar brought personally by the Virgin Mary to",
          "An amazing sight to see in the heart of Zaragoza! Highly recommended to be on the top of your list of places to see! Had a wonderful visit!",

          "Stopped in Zaragoza for only 4 hours and could only visit a couple of places and this one definitely is remarkable and the right choice. An impressive architecture and marvelous decoration. Stepped inside and got chocked with its wonderful details. Couldn't get up to the tower",
          "We stopped in Zaragoza to kick off a driving tour north through Huesca to Jaca and on to Donostia, spectacular architecture and history - we felt like Zaragoza deserved more of our time and this primarily came from the walk through the cathedral. Just wow....",
          "Really impressive building both inside and out. Sitting at a nearby cafe with a drink and tapas watching the light on the building as the sun goes down is lovely!",
          "Enjoyed visiting the church and the tower. The tourist office opens by 10am no brochures available at church explaining anything and you have to cross the street to get these details from tourist office which was over crowded due to late opening. The ascending of the tower was",
          "One of those most incredible Basilicas we have seen, and we have seen many of them! Craftsmanship is extraordinary. Fortunately we were present for the Assumption Feast Day Mass, although we don't speak Spanish we know the 'process', it was beautiful. The organ sound is",
          "Absolutely gorgeous building, so many different frescos on the ceiling, keep those eyes up, absolutely stunning",

          "Having had my fill of Cathedrals, Basilicas, and all things church like I really approached this Basilica in a nonchalant manner. What a mistake. This Basilica is probably the most magnificent I have ever seen, including the Vatican. The craftsmanship on display is simply",
          "Friends in Cantabria said that we must not miss this place, and I was glad that we listened. The place is huge and would take up 3x full size football fields..it has to be seen to be believed. Could only be described as 'churches within churches'...wonderful architecture. I did",
          "Can't take photos inside the basilica, but it helps you enjoy the majestic, ornate, and overwhelming decor. Breathtaking upon entering the building.",
          "This is a very, very beautiful church, one of the many magnificent churches in Spain. It is even more stunning when you view it across the Ebro in the afternoon. This is the first church dedicated to the honor of the Virgin Mary by St. James the Great. We passed by Zaragoza on",
          "It is hard to review this location as nothing can describe it other than a stunning example of church architecture. Inside is equally as impressive as the outside. The central issue as with everything is disrespectful tourists making noise, taking photos (when it asks not too)",
          "On first approach it is difficult to comprehend the enormous size of the basilica until you walk along the frontage, which is a very pleasant pedestrianised area with fountains that many locals and tourists will freely run around in to cool down. It is free to enter, as",
          "We visited the basilica as part of a tour led by a member of the Tourist Office and were advised before entering the Pilar that the security people didn't appreciate the tourists in the basilica. Sue enough we were asked to move on, to stop talking (we weren't!) and they",
          "The splendor and beauty is remarkable. Take the time to see the different chapels. The outside is just as beautiful as the inside of the Basilica.",
          "This is another memorable basilica. Let's start by saying it's free no charge to get in. The inside was beautiful but with a different lay out. Everyone here was wonderful and just very cozy basilica. This is one that if you can an on your way should visit. Enjoy.",
          "This is a Barroque huge church that is a pure show of the people's devotion to Mary, the mother of Jesus. For being Barroque is not that much decorated but on the other hand is extremelly big, an on there it comes its magnificense. A must see on this town.",
          "It was an amazing visit. The moment we entered, mass was starting so we attended the mass. It was such an amazing feeling being inside this church that is hundreds of years old. I can not imaging the work that went on inside of this church. I understand it took hundreds of",

          "The church itself is huge but forgettable I will have to admit. The views of the city and the colorful tiled roof of the church from the tower however is amazing. They charge a small fee to take the elevator up but it is worth it.",
          "OK so it may sound a bit weird to review a lift in a basilica of this much historic significance. But it is truly an exhilarating ride and then climb (I think it was about 4E per person). NOT FOR THE faint hearted. The views out over Z to the plains are spectacular. If you don't",
          "The Basilica is gorgeous inside and out. I really enjoyed looking spires of the roof and the decorative tile that covered many of them. The inside is also full of attractive chapels, and enormous altarpieces and alter canopies. This is a must see if in Zaragoza, and frankly,",
          "I have seen maybe umpteen cathedrals in Europe, but this is really a must see. With its many architectural styles, chapels and exquisite frescoes (including by Goya and Vazquez), don't miss this one. If you can time your visit correctly for a Sunday, the organ is also fantastic.",
          "The Pilar is the at the top of things to do in Zaragoza... The church itself is on a scale that nearly rivals St. Peter's in Rome, it's really that big. The inside is full of chapels and artifacts that truly inspire ... not the least of which are a pair of unexploded bombs",
          "If you visit Zaragoza you shouldnot miss visting this beautiful basilica. Both the inside and the outside have outstanding areas to watch. You will respect what mankind has done in this city when you go around this Basilica. You can take beautiful pictures from the bridges over",
          "Really impressive building. Beautiful both on the inside and from the outside. Thumbs up for not charging anything to enter the church.",

          "We visited on a super hot summer day it was muggy and too hot for us to stroll around at our leisure sadly. But still you can appreciate the amazing architecture and stature of such a building. It's worth knowing your aren't allowed to take photos inside and also as its a",
          "This was my favorite cathedral of all those we visited in Spain. It's beautifully maintained and is so clearly part of the community instead of a tourist attraction. We happened to visit during a mass and it was wonderful to see the visitors being respectful instead of taking",
          "We were traveling from Barcelona on the way to Bilbao. We had a brief stop in Zaragoza to see the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar or the Lady of the Pillar. It's located right along the Ebro river and is in the baroque style. It was constructed between 1681 and 1754.",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral of the Savior (Spanish: Catedral del Salvador) or La Seo de Zaragoza is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Zaragoza, in Aragon, Spain. It is part of the World Heritage Site Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon.\nThe cathedral is located on the Plaza de la Seo and is commonly known as La Seo (Aragonese for \"see\") to distinguish it from the nearby El Pilar, whose name (pillar) is a reference to an apparition of Mary in Zaragoza (also known as Saragossa). They both share co-cathedral status in metropolitan Zaragoza.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe location of the Seo has its roots in the old Roman forum. Unlike other Roman city forums, the forum of Caesaraugusta was not located at the confluence of the Cardus and the Decumanus, but instead near the Ebro river, adjoining the river port. The forum, besides being the civic and commercial center of the city, contained the main temple. The Museum of the Forum is found below the plaza del Pilar, across from the facade of the cathedral. There have been no remains found of either a Visigoth or a Mozarabic church. \n\n\n=== The Mosque ===\nHanas ben Abdallah as San'ani (? \u2013 718), a disciple of someone close to Mohammed, built the main mosque of Saraqusta al Baida, Zaragoza la Blanca, according to Al-\u1e24umayd\u012b (1029\u20131095). The main mosque is certainly one of the oldest of Al-Andalus. The edifice underwent two additions, one in the 9th century and one in the 11th century, under the Taifa king of Zaragoza, Mundir I. During the restoration completed in 1999, a number of remains were discovered, such as the impression of the minaret on the external walls, and the floor of the ancient structure. In addition, the entrance was located in the same place as that of the current cathedral.\nThe arrival in Zaragoza in 1118 of Alfonso I, the Battler did not lead to the immediate demolition of the mosque. He gave the Muslims one year to move out of the town, and on October 4, 1121, the building was consecrated under the name San Salvador, and the necessary renovations were made to allow the building to be used for Christian purposes.\n\n\n=== The Romanesque Cathedral ===\nThe destruction of the mosque and the construction of the Late Romanesque cathedral began in 1140. The new church, with a basilical layout consisting of a transept and three naves ending in apses, constructed of stone, owed much stylistically to the Cathedral of Jaca, from which it took various elements. Besides the church building itself, it had an archive, a refectory, a nursery, and two cloisters. From this era the lower part of two of the apses is still preserved, with small windows between inscribed capitals depicted, adorned with so-called \"checkered jaqu\u00e9s\" on the outside, and, inside, a set of sculptures that at present are hidden behind the main altarpiece.  The construction of the original cathedral continued throughout the 13th century.\nFrom 1204 up until the 15th century, all Aragonese kings were crowned in this church, by a special privilege bestowed by Pope Innocent III. The king, who the previous night had kept watch over his armaments in the Aljafer\u00eda, would approach from there in a procession. The ceremony included four parts: investiture of weapons, unction with holy oil, placing of the crown and the royal insignia, and oath of the fueros (statutes) and liberties of the Kingdom of Aragon. The last king to be crowned in La Seo was Charles I in 1518. Later kings needed only to swear to the fueros. Royal baptisms, weddings, and burials were also performed in the cathedral.\n\n\n=== The Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar Cathedral ===\n\nIn 1318 Pope John XXII created the archbishopric of Zaragoza, making it independent of the see of Tarragona, and with that the building became a metropolitan cathedral. From this point the additions were carried out using cheap materials that were found nearby in abundance: bricks and plaster. Under the supervision of the archbishop Pedro L\u00f3pez de Luna (1317\u20131345) a Gothic church with three naves (the present three central naves) was built,  keeping the Romanesque apses. The central nave was built higher than those on the sides, making it possible to create windows that from 1447 would be covered with stained glass. In 1346 a Mud\u00e9jar dome was started to provide light at the altar, with the participation of the masters Juan de Barbastro and Domingo Serrano. The work was finished in 1376,  when Don Lope Fern\u00e1ndez de Luna was already archbishop, creating a spacious, well-lit Gothic cathedral.\nIn 1360, during the archbishopric of Don Lope Fern\u00e1ndez de Luna, the main facade was renovated and the so-called Parroquieta was built, all in the Mud\u00e9jar style. The only thing that has been preserved is the Parroquieta or parochial chapel of San Miguel Archangel, that was built as a closed and independent chapel inside the building, and that archbishop Don Lope designed as a funeral chapel. The construction, elegantly carried out in Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar style, is a unique example of the work of the Aragonese masters and the Seville builders, who covered the exterior wall with geometric drawings made of smooth brick and glazed ceramic. In the interior, the roof is constructed of gilded wood, also in the Mud\u00e9jar style.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn 1403 the old dome fell down.  The Antipope Benedict XIII (Papa Luna), Aragonese by birth, initiated a reconstruction of the building.  The Romanesque apses were elevated, two towers buttressing the sides of the apses were added, and a new dome was built in the shape of a Papal Tiara.  Decorated in 1409 by the master Mohammed Rami, it may have been viewed by Benedict XIII on his visit to the city in 1410.\nThe main altarpiece was constructed during the archbishopric of Don Dalmau de Mur y Cervell\u00f3 (1431\u20131456).  Dalmau Mur concentrated on beautifying the interior of the building, taking charge of, besides the main altarpiece, the chorus and other smaller constructions.\nOn September 14, 1485, Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, the canon and head Inquisitor of Arag\u00f3n, was assassinated in the cathedral as he was praying while wearing a helmet and chain mail. This was the consequence of the bad reception that the Inquisition had in Arag\u00f3n, where it was seen as an attack by the crown on the fueros, the local laws and privileges. In particular, some of the most powerful families among the converted Jews - such as the S\u00e1nchez, Montesa, Paternoy, and Sant\u00e1ngel families -  were implicated in the assassination. As a consequence, there arose a popular movement against the Jews; \"nine were finally executed in persona, in addition to two suicides, thirteen burnings at the stake, and four punished for complicity\" according to the account of Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita. Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s was sainted by Pope Pius IX in 1867; his sepulchre, designed by Gil Morlanes the elder, is found within the cathedral in the chapel of San Pedro Arbu\u00e9s.\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, the cathedral was one of the centers of the Aragonese school of polyphonic music. Musicians Melchor Robledo, Sebasti\u00e1n Aguilera de Heredia, Pedro Ruimonte, Diego Pontac, Jus\u00e9pe Xim\u00e9nez and Andr\u00e9s de Sola, among others,  worked and composed there.\n\n\n=== Recent centuries ===\n\nThe long-standing rivalry between the canons of El Pilar and of La Seo was well known in the 17th century. The cathedral chapter of El Pilar even brought a suit to win the episcopal seat, a suit that was decided by Philip IV in favor of La Seo.  The disputes would not be resolved until, in 1676, Pope Clement X made the Solomon-like decision to merge the two chapters via the Bull of Union.  Six prebendaries and 15 canons would reside in La Seo, and the same in El Pilar, and the dean would live six months in each one.\nAlso during the 17th century, the old and decrepit Mud\u00e9jar tower was pulled down, and in 1686 construction was begun on a new one.  The new tower, which was designed in Rome in 1683 by Juan Bautista Contini in the Baroque style, was started in 1686 and  finished in 1704 with the placement of the spire.\nThe front was constructed in the 18th century in an Italian-Baroque style that was clearly of a neoclassic aspect.  It was entrusted by the Archbishop A\u00f1oa to Julian Yarza, a disciple of Ventura Rodr\u00edguez.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, a thorough restoration of the building took place, which lasted some 23 years.  The project can be divided into four stages:\n\nFrom 1975 to 1987: replacement of the six pillars of the main nave, roofs, eaves, glassworks, foundation, destruction of adjacent buildings, and archeological excavation.\nFrom 1987 to 1992: wall of the Parroquieta, dome, chapels of the head and neoclassical facade.\nFrom 1992 to 1994: completion of outside work and excavation of Roman and Muslim remnants.\nFrom 1995 to 1998: restoration of the tower, the spire and the clock, the organ, the main altarpiece; in general all the plasterwork and chapels were cleaned and restored; also the tapestry museum was renovated.In total more than two billion pesetas were spent by the Government of Aragon, the Archbishopric of Zaragoza and the Metropolitan Chapter, the Department of Education and Culture of Spain, Ibercaja, and Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada. As of 2005, the sacristy was still in the process of being restored.\n\n\n== Architectural styles ==\n\nLa Seo was built on the site of the ancient Roman forum of Augustus and of the main mosque of the Moorish city of Saraqusta, elements of whose minaret form part of the current tower. The construction began in the 12th century in the Romanesque style, and underwent many alterations and expansions until 1704, when the Baroque spire completed the tower.\nThe cathedral is a mixture of styles, from the Romanesque apse (12th century) to the Baroque tower and Neo-Classical main door (18th century), passing through Mud\u00e9jar and Gothic. Of the diverse styles that make up La Seo Cathedral, the most important elements are:\n\nRomanesque: in the exterior and the lower part of the apse. The Roman interior of the apse still remains, but is now covered by the Gothic altarpiece. In the sacristy are the \"olifante\" by Gaston IV of B\u00e9arn, built in ivory in the 11th century, and the relic-busts of Valerius of Saragossa (patron saint of Zaragoza), Saint Vincent of Saragossa, and St. Lawrence donated by the antipope Benedict XIII.\nGothic: mixed with Mud\u00e9jar, especially in the upper part of the exterior of the apse. The three central naves with their arches and tracery. Magnificent altarpiece largely of painted alabaster made by Pere Johan and Hans de Suabia. Choir stalls. Museum of Flemish tapestries from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, one of the three largest such collections in the world.\nMud\u00e9jar: exterior wall of the Parish of San Miguel and its interior roof, gilded with wood. The Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar has been named a World Heritage Site.\nRenaissance: In the Parroquieta of San Miguel, the tomb of the archbishop Don L\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez de Luna from the 16th century. Dome with Mud\u00e9jar influences, built in the first third of the 16th century to replace the older Moorish dome.\nBaroque: Tower and gate.The cathedral's museum has been restored recently and is open to  the public. It is a tapestry museum that displays one of the finest collections of tapestries in the world.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nBeginning with the foot of the cathedral, the chapels on the right side:\n\nDoor of the Pabostr\u00eda and atrium.  The interior of the door is the most interesting part.\nChapel of Our Lady of the Snows, a late Gothic chapel with Baroque altar and altar paintings by Francisco Ximeno.\nChapel of San Valero (Valerius).  Baroque entryway of gilded wood from the seventeenth century with scenes of the saints Valerius (patron of the city), Vincent, and Lawrence.  Walls were painted by Garc\u00eda Ferrer.\nChapel of Saint Helen, or the Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament.  The altar, entryway, and paintings by Francesco Lupicini of Florence are all Baroque works of the seventeenth century.\nChapel of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. The chapel was constructed by Garbriel Zaporta towards the end of the sixteenth century as a funerary chapel; only the lid of the sarcophagus has been preserved from that era. Dating from the Renaissance are altar decorations fashioned by Juan de Anchieta, bronze grating by Guill\u00e9n Trujar\u00f3n, and the doorway. The paintings and mosaics are believed to be the work of the painter Pedro Morone of Siena.\nChapel of Santo Dominguito de Val, patron saint of the Infanticos. This Baroque chapel dates back to the second half of the eighteenth century and houses the remains of the saint himself. Elliptical cupola (dome) that arches over very detailed plaster pechinas (support structures of the cupola).\nChapel of St. Augustine. Renaissance-era altar decorations by Gil Morlanes with sculptures by Gabriel Yoly and Jos\u00e9 Sanz (image of St. Augustine from 1720)\nChapel of Saint Pedro Arbu\u00e9s. On the walls appear framed paintings from the seventeenth century attributed to the artist Berdus\u00e1n. Below a canopy (pavilion-like draping of fabric) with Solomonic columns is a sculpture of Saint Pedro Arbu\u00e9s done by Juan Ram\u00edrez in the seventeenth century. Baroque doorway from the eighteenth century.Beginning with the foot of the cathedral, the chapels on the left side:\n\nChapel of St. Bernard. This is one of the greatest works of the Aragonese Renaissance. Between 1549 and 1555, it contained the tombs of the archbishop Hernando de Arag\u00f3n, who ordered its construction, along with that of his mother Ana de Gurrea. Juan Vizca\u00edno created the sepulchre of the archbishop, and Juan de Liceire did that of his mother. The altar decorations for the Chapel of San Bruno were entrusted to the sculptor Pedro de Moreto. All parts were made of alabaster. The grating is also from the Renaissance and was the work of Guill\u00e9n Trujar\u00f3n.\nChapel of St. Benedict. Commissioned in Gothic style in the sixteenth century, the construction was delayed by Hernando de Arag\u00f3n in order to collect the bodies of his servants.\nChapel of St. Mark.\nChapel of the Birth of Christ. Simple doorway from the sixteenth century. Altar decorations with panels attributed to Roland de Mois or Jer\u00f3nimo de Mora from the sixteenth century. Renaissance grating by Hernando de \u00c1vila.\nChapel of Saints Justa and Rufina. Paintings by Juan Galv\u00e1n hang over the walls. The painting of the saints was done by Francisco Camilo in 1644.\nChapel of St. Vincent. Baroque doorway. The sculpture of St. Vincent is from roughly 1760 and was created by Carlos Salas.\nChapel of St. James the Great (Santiago). A painting by Pablo Raviella from 1695. An image of St. James the pilgrim, from the 16th century, under a baroque canopy.Choir:\n\nThe choir section is formed by 117 oaken seats built by three monks named Gomar, Bernardo Giner, and Mateo de Cambiay. It is enclosed by a bronze grating accented with sculptures of gilded wood by Juan Ram\u00edrez. The archbishop Dalmau Mir is buried here.\nThe organ preserves some remnants of the Gothic organ of 1469 and pipes hailing from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. The present-day organ is the result of the integration of the complex historical pieces of the instrument, done between 1857 and 1859 by Pedro Roqu\u00e9s.\nTo the rear of the choir lies the chapel of the Holy Christ, with a representation of the crucified Christ, Mater Dolorosa (Mary) and St. John created by Arnau de Bruselas near the end of the sixteenth century; all of this is below a canopy supported by Solomonic columns of black marble. The decorations are the work of Jer\u00f3nimo Vallejo, Arnau de Bruselas, and Juan Sanz de Tudelilla, done in hardened plaster, and they form one of the most notable groups of sculpture from the Aragonese Renaissance. To the sides lie the small chapels of St. Martha, St. Matthew, St. John the Baptist, St. Thomas of Villanova, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Merced, Saint Leonard of Noblac, Saint Philip Neri, and Saint Orosia.Apses:\n\nChapel of the Virgen Blanca (White Virgin). Baroque altar decorations of wood with paintings by Jusepe Mart\u00ednez (1647), a painter from Zaragoza. Alabaster sculpture of the Virgin with child from the fifteenth century made by the French sculptor Fortaner de Uesques. On the floor lie various tombstones of the archbishops of Zaragoza from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\nMain altar decorations. Dedicated to the Savior, it was originally created in alabaster and painted by various artists from 1434 to 1480, most notably Pere Johan, Francisco Gomar, and Hans Piet D'anso. It can be considered one of the greatest works of European Gothic sculpture.\nChapel of St. Peter and St. Paul. Altar decorations of gilded wood with relief scenes of the lives of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCatholic Church in Spain\nAljafer\u00eda\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the Spanish-language Wikipedia, which was accessed in the version of 21 February 2006.\nLostal Pros, Joaqu\u00edn; Arturo Ans\u00f3n Navarro (2001).

          "There are a lot of churches in Zaragoza, and most of them are free, whereas this charges, but it is worth it! It is like 20 churches in one as there are so many side chapels, each with its own unique quality, most of them of stunning beauty, and the main altar backdrop is",
          "My husband, son, and I went there today. We like historical sites, and we enjoyed walking around this church. If you enjoy tapestries, be sure to find the tapestry museum. It doesn\u2019t cost any extra, but it\u2019s easy to miss if you aren\u2019t paying attention. Plan to spend at least an",
          "One of the most beautiful and interesting churches we have visited. Stunning architecture and unusual artistic features make this a very special place.",
          "Spectacular chapels, amazing space, overall wow! Be advised the watchers are diligent about \u201cno photos!\u201d Go!!!",
          "La Seo is a huge gothic cathedral with incredibly elaborate chapels in the side aisles as well as a central choir lined with little chapels. I guess it is interesting from an artistic point of view, but I found it emotionally cold, especially in comparison to the Basilica del",
          "Currently restoring the exterior but check out the beautiful ceramic tiled side wall ( left exterior wall when facing front facade). The interior is also full of interesting art and do not miss the exquisite tapestry rooms upstairs. The location of the church is near at the far",
          "Even if you just look at the outside you will be amazed at the mosaic of geometrical architecture on the stone - this used to be a mosque and was turned into a church",
          "The church is arguably more impressive than the basilica however both have a lot of charm. The architecture and decor have been well documented for you to read about once inside. Truly jaw dropping but I respected the no photography policy. The tapestry museum is fascinating",
          "The old cathedral, known as La Seo stands at the far end of plaza del pilar. The gleaming exterior is essentially gothic-mudejar. The wall on a side is with elaborate geometric patterns. Make it really stunning. Must see it.",
          "Fantastic bell tower and huge cathedral, built into the medieval mosque. Very nice surroundings and area. However entrance is locked as its on some kind of reconstruction",
          "Exquisite azure mosaic design on the cathedral exterior. Sadly I did not go inside as the cathedral closes for much of the day. Check opening times.",
          "Absolutely stunning - one of the most beautiful reilgeous buildings I have ever seen. Only drawback - no photography.",
          "Inside, this cathedral is the most beautiful and impressive buidling in Zaragoza, more so than the Basilica del Pilar. Exquisite vaulted ceilings in high-Gothic style, ornate chapels, spectacular altar pieces The tapestry museum. Unfortunately the whole thing closes in the",
          "I had friends waiting for me, but once I got upstairs to the tapestry museum I texted them to tell them not to wait: there was no way I could NOT take a good look once there, as the tapestries were stunning: 15th-century Flemish masterworks that are well worth a visit.",
          "You have to pay entrance to this church. But it is worth the money. It is Absolutely beautiful inside. You are not allowed to take pictures so you have to visit it. But if you are in Zaragoza it is a must. I found La Seo more awesome than El Pilar.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful Cathedral I've seen in my life. Check with TI open hours, the Cathedral is not open all day. Absolutely no photos inside. The Cathedral located in center of town at Plaza de la Seo and and it can be seen from another not less famous central",
          "Just as beautiful as Pilar, if not more! The design inside and out is breath taking. Worth combining with a visit to Plaza Pilar.",
          "Probably the Catedral on Pilar in Zaragoza is the most famous one so after visiting it we could not imagine that once we enter the La Seo del Salvador cathedral it will be difficult for us to say which one is more interesting. Just stunning... marvellous architectural gem.",
          "We were looking forward to visiting La Seo and it was supposed to be open till 2 p.m. We got to the entrance at 13.30 and were not allowed in. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to go back",
          "Don't be fooled by the outside of this church, inside s absolutely stunning. Gothic arches and baroque decoration make this a must see when in Zaragoza. Every chapel is spectacular with no shortage of decoration. The entry fee is a pittance, however photos are not permitted",
          "Significantly reduced from its original size, La Seo is nevertheless an artistic jewel. The exterior of the building displays beautiful Moorish tile work, whereas the in interior shows perfect baroque decoration in a series of chapels. Unesco heritage site - entrance fee",
          "From a distance, the beauty of this tower stands out, no pun intended. Walking closer one can begin to appreciate the intricate beauty, the interesting architecture and gracious design. Enjoy!",
          "I'm not into religion so this visit was strictly because I admire baroque art and architecture. I wasn't disappointed. In fact it was almost overwhelming. The cathedral looks small from the outside and walking into the main cathedral takes your breath away. As an added",
          "Another stunning Zaragoza building. Entry fee is modest (a few euros) and well worth it. You can spend a good two hours here and at the Tapestry Museum upstairs.",
          "This is a beautiful church built on what had been a Moorish mosque. The Moorish features are still evident. The tapestry museum in the rear deserves a few minutes. Photos are not allowed inside but you are given a guide with some very nice photos.",
          "Not to be missed. Overshadowed in the city by the basilica, but my partner and I much preferred this. Wonderful atmosphere and good amount of information provided. One of the best cathedrals I\u2019ve visited!",
          "Awesome cathedral, clearly meant to awe and it does. Whatever your thoughts on Church/religion you should visit for the achitecture alone. Includes a fascinating Tapestry Museum which is well worth a visit in itself. Easy to find - only a few yards from the Plaza del Pilar",
          "This is probably the first cathedral I have visited where I couldn't find one candle. Some churches have electric candles, which is not the same. I refuse to light one of those, it's just not got the feeling. Otherwise it is a very nice cathedral.",
          "For me, the best cathedral to visit in Zaragoza. Once restored, the light that enters in the temple and the mix of cultures along it, both inside and outside deserve it.",
          "Although not as large and dramatic as the Basilica it is worth visiting. As seniors we got a reduced entrance fee and also provided leaflet in English which helped alot. We visited the tapestry exhibition which was well worth the time even though there is no info in English",
          "I have seen a lot of cathedrals and this is one of the most interesting/beautiful. I would really recommend seeing this one.",
          "The \u201cCatedral Del Salvador\u201d or \u201cCathedral of the Saviour\u201d nick named also as the \u201cLa Seo\u201d, is a \u201cRoman Catholic Cathedral, who is part of the \u201cWorld Heritage Site Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon. The Cathedral is located on the \u201cPlaza de la Seo\u201d but commonly known as the \u201cLa Seo\u201d",
          "We had to pay to enter the cathedral and we were given a guide leaflet, available in several languages. Inside there are 19 chapels, each with a descriptive pillar telling about it in English and Spanish. There was an organ recital while were there, which was a bonus. The",
          "This is a paid for attraction and as a result it's quieter. You get a free English guide so you really can understand the artwork. It's quiet and reflective and well worth a visit when in Zaragoza.",
          "Small entrance charge but you get multilingual (returnable) guide to provide information about all the chapels and the central choir area - an interesting phenomenon that the choirs of these Spanish cathedralls are enclosed - not seen that before. You can spend about 1/2 hour",
          "Don't miss this gem of Zaragoza but mind they close at least 30 minutes before the service. The official opening hours are not respected, unfortunately.",
          "La Seo del Salvador is the real Cathedral of the city (not the Basilica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar) and it is located in Pilar Square, near the Basilica, in the old town. However the outside facade seems not so impressive as Basilica, the inner part, for me, is very beautiful.",
          "This was the highlight of my trip to the city. A feast for the senses - you must see the tapestries as well as the cathedral.",
          "Very large cathedral of Zaragoza, La Seo. Impressive interior. Built in XVII century. Gothic design.",
          "The La Seo Cathedral is located near the end of the Pilar Plaza on the Plaza de la Seo. The cathedral is a mixture of styles, including Romanesque (exterior and apse), Baroque (tower and gate), Neo-classical (main door), Mud\u00e9jar (interior roof and exterior wall) and Gothic",
          "Maybe we should have visited the Goya Museum after this cathedral, because we found the cathedral to be the most depressingly opulent one we have seen (we've seen many in 20+ years of traveling in northern and western Europe). La Seu has two dozen chapels filled with gold",
          "Seo is the word for 'cathedral', one of the four feminine Spanish words ending in -o which are not an abbreviation. Pay attention and do not miss the old mudejar (Moorish) wall and the older part of the Seo, outside. The restauration of the inside is perfect and everything is",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral. The tapestry collection is stunning. Visitors may wish to compare it to the nearby Basilica Del Pilar, which is far more crowded..",
          "We have spent around an hour in this place. We really like interior design of it. Every part of the building was very well preserved.",
          "I agree with the reviewer who said that it was better than the Basilica del Pilar. A beautiful space, with numerous beautifully decorated side chapels and a sense wonder. Highly recommended.",
          "Stunning architecture and paintings- a real gem. Well worth every cent of the 4 euros admission charge",
          "I actually found this more interesting that the nearby Pilar basilica. 4 euro entry. I dont agree they should charge people to visit a church, but this includes the tapestry museum so I guess thats how they get away with it. The English leaflet was very informative with map of",
          "While the Pilar is definitely beautiful, I would argue that the Seo is the most breathtaking of the two famous cathedrals. The artwork is beautiful, and the atmosphere is quiet and peaceful. There are many display signs in Spanish and English throughout the building. The",
          "We had just visited the large magnificent looking El Pillar the day before and saw this sad building all covered in scaffolding, standing at the side. Knowing its history of crowning kings in the past, we felt motivated to attend Easter service there. And was it such a blessing",
          "Gothic style stunning inside and out; build in the 1300s and there is so much to see inside. Must visit in Zara...",
          "Of the two big churches in Plaza del Pilar, I would suggest that Seo cathedral is the more satisfactory on the inside. As I mention in my review of the Basilica del Pilar, that heavy Spanish baroquery needs some austerity to set it off, and the light stone interior - in a kind",
          "There was a small cost for entrance but it was well worth it. There are many different chapels within the cathedral and the leaflet you receive on entry gives details of each in a number of languages including English. The sheer beauty is amazing and there are lots of excellent",
          "It wasn't what I expected and I thought the entrance fee did not merit an entrance as the view inside from the outside wasn't crash hot.",
          "This cathedral is at one end of the Plaza, the same Plaza where the Basilica. This cathedral is older than the Basilica. There are older parts and newer parts. This cathedral is very ornate inside with beautiful art and carvings and statues and domes. This is why it is a must",
          "No photography is allowed either here or La Pillar which is a great shame because it is spectacularly beautiful. There were also works by Goya and the most amazing sculpture on display. Very disappointing service from the closest Tourist Office who did not have the linguistic",

          "The architecture is amazing. The small bricks used are architecture is similar to the islamic/Persian mosque design. But it has its own character. dont miss it.",
          "Born and raised in the neighborhood, the cathedral happened to be my parish. I used to go to mass with my mother. I always looked with curiosity at the scenes depicted in the walls around the choir. It continues the same, spectacular. The feelings, art, long-standing values,",
          "Do not miss this church when in Zaragoza. The ticket costs 4 euros (and 3 for students)...well worth it. Watch out for opening times...when we visited...the closed at lunch time and reopened at 4pm! For a freezing cold winter day...that is a lot of waiting! When we walked",
          "A jewel, particularly because of Mudejar architecture in some parts of the inside and a whole wall outside. The whole cathedral is also very nice to visit, with a nice hangings museum. Please check and double check timetable since they are quite restrictive and you may finish",
          "This is a really spectacular cathedral with very beautiful chapels and is well worth the admission price. Unfortunately photos are not permitted. Many different architectural styles in this cathedral which was built on the site of of the old Roman forum. Many centuries later",

          "It is located in the Plaza Del Pilar and has an interesting number of architectural styles to it. Originally, it was the site of an Islamic mosque......before which was a Roman site. All of this is reflective of the different conquerors of Zaragoza's history.",
          "Tjhis cathedral is near the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar.Admission 5 euros ??? (not sure). The exterior of this cathedral looks not so attractive, but inside really amazing and better than Basilica. Must see in Zarogosa. Day trip from Madrid by high speed train (1 hour",

          "The most beautiful cathedral, really worth a look. When wondering around from one chapel to another within the cathedral, the detail in each individual chapel is magnificent, and the cost to maintain would be astronomical. You can see the Muslim iinfluence in a lot of the",
          "We didn't go inside, but enjoyed some peace and quiet in the plaza. The left side wall of the church is absolutely stunning. When we went on a Saturday there was an event on - maybe a wedding, and so you couldn't enter in the morning.",
          "Not all that familiar with the insides of such a place but this one took my breath away. The grandeur, the nooks, the paintings, the floor, the roof. Needless to say it is impressive. No pictures allowed inside so see it for yourself. The little paintings done by Goya that",
          "Adjacent to the Basilica and as stunning, the history, culture and grandeur make this a must see. I ciuld not believe how impressive both the Cathedral and the Basilica were, don't miss them",
          "normally at Zaragoza everybody visits the Basilica of El Pilar, only 100 mts from there you can admire a jewel of mixture of cultures, the old mosque and now cathedral of La Seo. Outside can enjoy still the muslim art while inside , out of the noise of other monuments, can enjoy",
          "Wonderful cathedral, plenty of small chapels and magnificent organ. Superb sculptures to see and appreciate. After this visit the tapestry museum by St.Bartholomews Door.",
          "Inside and out, the Seo is a lovely building, with a fascinating mixture of architectural styles and artistic decorations. The high altar, the choir, and the small tower that lets light in to the altar area are not to be missed. There is also a tapestry museum covered in the",
          "Very impressive place to visit. We found it more impressive than the basillica because of the ornate ceiling and it felt calmer and more relaxed. It costs a few euros to enter but once inside there is no time limit. Marvel at how big the place is. We worked out that our house",
          "Normally I can leave Baroque-style structures alone, but this one is quite extraordinary. A twelfth-century frame on which has been stretched parts from the 15th century (main altar), the 16th, the 17th (many of the side chapels), somehow it all comes together. Modern lighting",
          "One of the most spectacular and awe inspiring churches I have ever seen. Beautiful sacred music been played in the background. Orgeous architecture.",
          "From the outside the building appears rather plain compared to its near neighbour, the Basilica. But on entering it is a stunning site that awaits you. The shear size is amazing, together with the carvings and decorations. It really is a spectacle and puts the interior of the",
          "A treasure alongside the Pilar Cathedral. There is background of sacred music. Have a nice tapestry museum.",
          "If you don't mind paying to visit a church, this visit is truly imperative The \"parroquieta\" -accessible through the door to the left of the main one when open- it is free for worship purpose. In it, the coffered ceiling and the Fernandez de Luna's sarcophagus are extraordinary",

          "Beautiful cathedral with magnificent tapestry museum attached. This just one of attractions in Zaragoza - all excellent. Lovely walkable city.",
          "We walked into La Seo del Salvador and it's amazing. However, I have personally been to numerous similar architectures and didn't find this much of a difference than others. FREE to go in so drop by to have a look.",
          "I went around this Cathedral after visiting the basilica de nuestra senora del pillar. It is a mix of mudejar, baroque and gothic styles. I was baffled by the wonderful and delicate workmanship of the mudejars in the middle ages. I didnot have the time to enter though. You must",
          "If you like the cathedral in Toledo, maybe you will also adore this beautiful cathedral- La Seo de San Salvador. The entrance fee is 4\u20ac, it's a pity they do not allow taking photo inside! But the benefit is that you will give your whole concentration to observe every corner of",
          "This cathedral is a mix of renaissance and gothic architecture. To British eyes it is less attractive because the choir is in the centre and this obscures the long views of the nave that are typical of gothic cathedrals. There is an interesting tapestry museum attached to the",
          "The Seo Cathedral is a not very known wonder in Spain. The mixture of mudejar, gothic and barroc makes it unique. The tapestries included in the museum with the entrance ticket are amazing. Pity they don't allow pictures inside. They should offer audioguides as they are doing in",
          "La Seo was the best we have ever been in - anywhere - so much to see (English leaflet - which is NOT available everywhere). Beautiful inside which is not the impression you necessarily get from the outside - DO NOT miss this. Tapestry Museum within is also very impressive.",
          "The cathedral is the equal of Seville and Toledo, an over-the-top place of gold leaf, wood and marble carving, paintings and frescoes, and anything else that one can add. Every view and angle shows something spectacular.",
          "We visited this after the cathedral and were delighted with the order as we found this church even more impressive, despite the fact that it was smaller.",
          "You are charged to go into the cathedral, but it is impressive inside and in my view more interesting than the El Pilar. There is a stunning alabaster altarpiece with a reliquary to St Valorie. And at the other end an extraordinary chased gold altar canopy. But the best part is",
          "pretty inside. they have a three floor museum inside , goes right to the top from where there is a good view of the plaza del pillar",
          "Beautifully restored over the last fifty years. A mixture of architectural styles. Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance and Moorish",
          "La Seo is a very interesting cathedral - and definitely worth a visit. The decor is extremely busy inside ... so much so that it feels overwhelming. Similar to it's neighbor, Our Lady of the Pillar, it has multiple chapels, but it feels like each one is competing with the next.",
          "This museum was really well lit and organized. incredible workmanship. For anyone who is interested in the needle arts...this was great.",
          "Seeing La Seo from El Pilar, I wasn't really impressed and I wondered why it was so well rated...then I went to the side! What a spectacular side facade, well worth seeing!",
          "Though not as stunning as its neighbour, the Basilica, this ancient church displays the Muslim roots in Spain very well.",
          "We could appreciate the 20 year recent renovation as this Cathedral sparkles from the patterned floor to rib vaulted ceiling, throughout a score of side chapels, to the altar and choir. Upstairs, three rooms feature over 30 15th to 16th C Flemish tapestries, all in superb",
          "The cathedral itself is very impressive, however every chapel inside is separate peace of art. In addition there is the tapestry collection.",
          "The old cathedral in Zaragoza is an amazing place to visit, richly decorated, exquisite altars, definitely a must have",
          "Quite a sumptuous church - beautiful sculptures, paintings - the artwork is splendid. A tapestry museum upstairs with an interesting collection of tapestries that we found quite fascinating from the 15 and 16th centuries.",
          "This impressive cathedral is also the home to an amazing tapestry museum. It is a UNESCO heritage listed site and when you visit you can understand why. It is a very tranquil place to visit, a beautiful example of Gothic Mudejar architecture, do not rush your visit, soak in the",

          "Actually a nice interesting cathedral which has many interesting sculptures around the chapels, the retabel is nice as well but not as elaborate as the side chapels. The downside you have to pay 4 EUR to get inside and - as usual for catholic churches where you need to pay to",
          "The day we visited the Basilica del Pilar, this cathedral was not open, so we came back the next day. We went around the building to admire to be able to see it in its entirety. The best view, however, is from the Plaza del Pilar. Make sure to check the opening times, so you",
          "You have to listen to the wonderful bells - even better whilst sitting in the sunshine with a lovely glass of wine.",
          "This is right in the heart of the city just to the left to Pilar if you are facing the cathedral. A very beautiful place with a rich history and very interesting architecture which basically tells the story of the city through the ages and the various conquerors. Worth a stop,",
          "The cathedral was renovated a few years ago. It has magnificently high arches and stunning detail. It doesn't have the buzz of the Basilica del Pilar, but rather has the quite awe that you expect from a cathedral. We went early and our little boy made a bit of noise, but the",
          "It has been a really nice place where having a walk, particularly in sunny days. You can breath the Spain air.",
          "A ticket is 4 euros but it's definitely worth it. You will be provided with a guide explaining the history of each area inside the cathedral. It is peaceful and a beautiful example of Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar architecture. Take your time to admire the intricately decorated interior.",
          "The La Seo del Salvador is a UNESCO heritage listed site - and deservedly so. Each alcove is elaborate and rich in art. The provided guide sheet provides information for each area. Tranquil and quiet, this is a recommended visit.",
          "This city church is not so big as Plaza de Pilla or other church but the architecture is still beautiful and worth to visit.",
          "Really beautiful inside with chapels and altars very intricately decorated. Unfortunately, there are no English explanations or guides for the chapels. Also a 4 Euro entry fee.",
          "Very interesting place with an gorgeus architecure that combines three important styles. Take your time here because realy worth seeing.",
          "Interest building tower to yr eyes is not upright, photo taken look normal. Just beside to roman walls",
          "The La Seo (to \"see) is Zaragosa's second cathedral. Separated by only a short distance - equivalent to maybe 2 to 3 blocks - from the Basilica del Pilar, there was a long-standing rivalry between the two in the past. For several centuries, all Aragonese kings were crowned",
          "This cathedral is close to the basilica of Zaragoza and makes for an excellent double visit.. Both are fine examples of old religious buildings but for me the cathedral made for a better visit. The guide is available in English as part of the entry fee.",
          "A short walk from the Basilica, this is another beautiful building, inside and out. The interior is spectacular and full of history.",
          "La Seo is a beautiful building in the Basilica square. The structure features mudejar architecture and wonderful ceramic design on the north wall. The church contains a Tapestry museum at modest additional cost.",
          "This beautiful cathedral is built over the remains of Zaragoza's original Roman forum as well as a mosque built later. It demonstrates multiple architectural styles and has excellent Gothic design elements. The interior is divided into multiple small chapels with the relics of",
          "The entrance fee includes a visit to the tapestry museum. The latest is not my cup of tea but when you think about the amount of work that took it so many years ago, it's pretty impressive. The inside of the church is very beautiful especially one part that was completely",
          "To my amazement, the La Seo is the best Cathedral in Zaragoza and not the Pilar Cathedral. La Seo charge 4 euros for entrance, but it is worth it.It is beautifully maintained and the stained windows and everything including the magnificient Dome is outstanding . It also has some",
          "A very beautiful cathedral at the end of the plaza down the street from El Pilar Cathedral. There are restaurants righ near both churches",
          "Now I am not a religious person but have visited many cathedrals in Spain and have got to say this visit was mindblowing reflecting the faith, the history and the art of Aragon. Declared World Heritage in 2001 you can see why the minute you enter the gothic style cathedral and",
          "I personally enjoyed the visit to the Seo more than the visit to the Basilica. The space, paintings, fresco's and statues spoke more to my imagination than the visit to the Basilica.",
          "Very nice church, with impressive architecture, right next to Basilica del Pilar.I really liked the tapestry museum.",
          "It is so full of details tha in my opinion this temple is even more beatifull that El Pilar. It is a MUST DO visit in Zaragoza.",
          "Truly worth the entrance fee to see a stunning architectural masterpiece, with fantastic ceilings and chapels.",
          "This is a very pretty church but it is located in the same square as the Basilica del Pilar. If you visit this one first, you will be impressed but it is nothing compared to the Basilica del Pilar. It has a wonderful tapestry museum which is worth the modest fee.",
          "Amazing structure and art!! Islamc, Christian and Jewish influence is seen in the art and architecture inside and out.",
          "La Seo del Salvador was the first christian church to be built in Zaragoza, previously on this site was the Roman forum of the old city of Caesaraugusta. The Apse, parish and dome of La Seo del Salvador are included on the World Heritage List for its Mud\u00e9jar Architecture. This",
          "I thoroughly loved the visit to this gorgeous church. There were clear explanations of each chapel, there was renaissance music playing, there is a museum of tapestry, the architecture is absolutely beautiful. I loved the Moorish wall on the outside of the church.",
          "We had not read that much about La Seo and were surprised and greatly impressed by its beauty, decor and preservation. It has a fantastic altar, beautiful choir and a number of very interesting and beautiful small chapels along the walls. A beautiful, jewel of a cathedral, well",
          "Moorish, romanesque & baroque all combined in this cathedral, which is a haven of peace & tranquility. There is a small fee to pay, but it is worth the 3 or 4 Euro.",
          "Worth a visit for the beautiful baroque architecture inside. Information in Spanish and English. Awesome and spacious, lots to look at. Baroque and Moorish exterior.",
          "The view from the inside is extraordinary and you would love this place Seeing it from the outside does not give you the impression that it would be this awesome from the inside I would highly recommend it.",

          "Right across from the Basilica and located on the Plaza de la Seo. It is a Gothic style cathedral built over the remains of a mosque. The stone and art work is more impressive than the Basilica but it also allows no photos. You just have to go home with memories. It features an",
          "Strange to have a Cathedral right across the street from a Basilica , but this was a lovely church. 4 Euro's to enter , but really disappointed that we couldn't take photo's , even with the flash off. Can understand if Mass was going on , but that wasn't the case , so fell a bit",
          "When looking from Plaza del Pilar you see eye-catching cathedral\u2019s tower and rather unimpressive fa\u00e7ade. However after a visit inside and taking a stroll through Calle Sepulcro you\u2019ll leave with completely different impression. It was much more interesting inside than the nearby",
          "A stunning mixture of style, La Seo has everything an architecture buff is looking for. Peaceful, majestic and somewhat overshaddowed by the Pilar, you mustn't miss out on this jewel in the crown of Zaragoza.",

          "This is a very nice Cathedral with a mix of different styles (from Jewish to roman and arab...). You can see on its walls the evolution of the building over the centuries. Inside is very nice but dont open all time.",
          "A magnificent, very serene and spiritual place to see in Zaragoza. It is overshadowed by the Basilica, but the small fee to tour it is well worth what you will see. Incredible carvings, altars, and stone work. Quiet, but inspiring background music played all during our visit.",
          "What a beautiful place just to wander. So many different styles in this church. The main alter is mesmorizing and the tapestries are worth a visit.",
          "This church sits in the shadow of the huge cathedral, but its stonework is more impressive. Looking at the church from the plaza, travel around to the left side and view the intricate patterns from the narrow street.",
          "We liked this more than the Basilica. The stonework is far better and the atmosphere is more peaceful. The only problem is that you aren't allowed to take photographs. I understand that it is a place of worship, but they charge for entrance and that also makes it a place of",
          "Loved this place. It has so much going on, and is very informative about its history. This was almost a combination of a church and a museum. The tapestries were very interesting. I know a little Spanish, not enough to be fluent, so a lot of what I learned was translated",
          "There are many reasons to visit the Cathedral: the wonderful white stone, the patterned mudejar outside wall, the ornate baroque tower, the high gothic vaulting, the organ, the great golden altarpiece, the royal Aragonese tombs\u2026 Also some interesting side-chapels. One is",
          "Although I thought the Basilica was good, this beats the Basilica into a cocked hat. There are so many beautiful things to see. I took so long on walking around the church, I really did not have the time to take a careful look at the tapestries, which are also well worth",

          "The arches are impressive inside this church. I would say even more impressive than Basilica de Pilar. Definitely a recommended place to visit. The only drawback- there is an entrance fee, while basilica is for free.",
          "This place was fabulous and the tapestry collection was outstanding. Unfortunately, I was busy putting my money away at the ticket counter and didn't see the \"no photos\" sign. (At the Basilica, they had signs throughout reminding you not to take pictures.) After I had taken",

          "This cathedral is the most beautiful in Zaragoza where you can see inside all the arts in one place.....I recommend a guided visit.",
          "This Cathedral is well worth a visit. Just down the Plaza from the Basilica,doesn't look much from the outside,but amazing inside,I think it is more beautiful than the Basilica itself. For only 4 euros,you can spend up to an hour looking around,and we also saw the beautiful",
          "This church is a lot more impressive to me than it's bigger neighbor - Nuestra Senora del Pilar, and it's a lot bigger inside than you might think when walking up to it.",
          "A place of overwhelming intricacy, beauty and - yes - spirituality. Countless hours of work must have been put into creating this unique piece of art and you can still feel the fervor that must have driven the many creators and contributors. A place that does not only make you",
          "This cathedral has a square base and somehow this creates a very human dimension. I felt welcome, rather than intimidated as one can feel in big cathedrals. More like a moorish mosque with its human-sized proportions. The geometry apart, the interior is stunning. It is quiet",
          "a breath taking interior..... the structural framing is seemingly gothic but the plan (layout) is anything but. the building has been altered and changed and modified for many centuries for many reasons. must admit, the building maintains an amasingly high degree of integrity",
          "The Cathedral, together with the Bas\u00edlica, are two of the things you can't miss when you visit the city. La Seo is located over the old Roman forum, and is a mixture of many diferent artistic styles, from the Romanesque to apses or its stunning mudejar wall in the outer part to",

          "Located at the end of the same square as El Pilar, and near the new underground Roman forum site, the Cathedral features some lovely Arabic decoration on its walls and some intricate carvings on the tower. But it is inside where the cathedral is at its most glorious. It is a",
          "What has been said by others is true: this is a not-to-be-missed attraction. One of the interesting things about this church is the abundance of natural light that pours through the many windows, none of which are stained glass. The tapestry museum is fascinating.",
          "First time I managed to see it after over 25 years work. Don't miss it. It's much more interesting. (For the architecture) than the basilica. Indeed worth the visit, particularly the main altar. Try to have a guided visit so you enjoy all details",
          "This cathedral is really a jewel in Zaragoza, it is a place where you can feel the devotion of the people and appreciate the fine art of the building.",
          "Almost hidden in the shadows of the basilica this church reeks of great architecture, and history. Many of the side chapels are jaw-dropping in terms of their designs and use of vivid colors. Of particular note is the Tapestry museum which is located within the structure. Some",
          "The cathedral is quite an interesting place to visit, with over 20 chapels of various styles that are each interesting in their own way. Cavernous, even with a decent number of people in there it didn't feel too crowded. The downside was no photos were allowed.",
          "The cathedral is not the biggest in Spain, but has a spacious, gothic, white interior with plenty of details. The main retablo is rather impressive, and there are many smaller altars with artworks in gothic, renassance and baroque styles. Do also have a look at the exterior",
          "Don't miss this cathedral, it's perfect. It dates back to the 13-th century and it is authentic. If you come there, don't forget to visit the Tapestries museum which is inside.",
          "The left navata is spectacular, check the Capilla del los arcangeles, with a wonderful renaissance portal and wonderful azulejos.",
          "La Seo is also a cathedral. In Zaragoza, most people are more drawn to El PIlar, which is the host of the image of Our Lady of The Pillar\". The artistic value of La Seo, though, is greater and you should definitely visit it. Each chapel has a different decoration.",
          "Perhaps due to the size of the Basilica del Pilar and its religious importance, one has the sensation that the Cathedral Seo del Salvador is somehow less important: nothing could be more wrong. It's an architectural gold mine (both inside and outside) as well as a very pleasant",
          "Lovely Medieval cathedral. It was closed for 18 years while the interior was cleaned and it is now a bright and luminous place. One chapel has been left as it was so you can appreciate the incredible change. Interesting chapels and monuments. Don't forget to walk around the",
          "La Seo Cathedral is located in the Plaza de la Seo, and is impressive, huge, with everything inside with a white color. The church was built in 1316 and the style is Gothic-Mudejar. The exterior still shows the brick and the glazed tiles used in the Mudejar design. Many of",

          "This is one of the \"must-sees\" of Zaragoza: you could spend hours admiring the artwork in the different chapels, except that if the sun isn't shining...yes, that happens in Spain too...then the chapels are a bit dim. And of course the altar-piece is amongst the most",
          "I thought it was the best Cathedral that I visited on a two week trip to Spain that included Barcelona and Girona. And don't miss the attached museum of tapestries.",
          "Worth seeing, even if you aren't a church person. It's a very interesting blend of cultures.",
          "This is a most unusual cathedral, very different on the inside (very ornate) than the outside (relatively plain). No photos allowed, which I understand, but for once no gift shop and no postcards available at the local shops either. Definitely a must see, but I am sorry not to",
          "Stunning church. Entrance fee of 3 euros well worth the charge.",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro. Founded in 1942, it plays in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B \u2013 Group 2, holding home games at Campo Municipal de F\u00fatbol La Almozara, which has a capacity of 1,000 seats.\nZaragoza CFF is a Spanish women's football team from Zaragoza playing in Primera Divisi\u00f3n Femenina.\nZaragoza was one of the Spanish cities which hosted the FIFA World Cup 1982.

        "wiki": "Pablo Emilio or Pau Emili Gargallo Catal\u00e1n (5 January 1881 \u2013 28 December 1934), known simply as Pau or Pablo Gargallo, was a Spanish sculptor and painter.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Maella, Aragon, he moved to Barcelona, Catalonia, with his family in 1888, where he would begin his training in the arts. Gargallo developed a style of sculpture based on the creation of three-dimensional objects from pieces of flat metal plate, and he also used paper or cardboard. Some of these sculptures have a form of cubism. For example, only one half of a face may be shown, and it may have only one eye. He also made more traditional sculptures in bronze, marble and other materials. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the town of ralls Aragonese avant-garde.\n\nHe spent a significant part of his life in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. In 1903, he invested a studio at the Cit\u00e9 d'Artistes, rue Vercing\u00e9torix in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. There he met Max Jacob and Carlos Casagemas, both friends of Pablo Picasso.In 1907, he stayed at the artists commune Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre with Max Jacob, Juan Gris and other artists. He spent his first night in the studio of his friend Picasso, whose head he modeled as a sculpture. There he was able to contemplate Picasso's seminal proto-Cubist painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Shortly thereafter, Juan Gris introduced him to Magali Tartanson, whom he married in 1915. During this period, Gargallo was influenced by the work of Picasso.\nAmong Gargallo's works are three pieces based on Greta Garbo: \"Masque de Greta Garbo \u00e0 la m\u00e8che,\" \"T\u00eate de Greta Garbo avec chapeau,\" and \"Masque de Greta Garbo aux cils.\"\nTogether with D\u00eddac Masana, Gargallo sculpted the great arch over the front of the stage of the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in Barcelona. The work depicts the Ride of the Valkyries in Richard Wagner's opera Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyries).\nGargallo suffered from fulminating bronchial pneumonia and died in Reus, Tarragona. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the Spanish avant-garde, and in 1985 the Pablo Gargallo Museum in Zaragoza opened in the former Argillo Palace. Gargallo's birthplace and early home, on the street now dedicated to his name in Maella, Zaragosa, has been transformed into a museum dedicated to his life and works.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nP.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

          "Our daughter and her husband, who live in Zaragoza, said the newly renovated Mercado Central opened this past Thursday (6 February) and is quite beautiful! We\u2019re looking forward to seeing it on our next visit.",
          "We actually went looking to go see this Mercado, but when we got there we saw that it was closed. The building itself is an iron and glass structure. It's nice on the outside, and am sure after the renovation it will be super on the inside too.",
          "This Zaragoza's Central Market is a lovely building but unfortunately under renovation so the market itself is closed here. I believe they have a temporary location but I didn't make the effort to go. I did find the market's architecture to be picture worthy so I snapped a",
          "They are rebuilding the market so it\u2019s in a temporary location across the street, still more than worth a visit!",
          "In all fairness, a true review cannot be done. The interior appears to have been gutted and workers were doing major work on the exterior as well. This place will probably be very nice when it is done, but I would guess that this will be closed for months.",
          "Mercado de Lanuza with it's sinuous ironwork in the Art Nouveau style is worth a look even though it's under repair.",
          "What you attempt to buy is NOT what you are looking at. We tried to buy vegetables from 3 different stalls, along with an old Spanish lady,all traders tried to sell old stock from the back. I asked for a bolsa [ bag] to choose my own fruit and one shouted ,'no, no ,no'.He",
          "For those that expect a Boqueria un Barcelona-Disney-style market this one could surprise or disappoint you. But this is a REAL XXI century Spanish market: a beautiful and historical building, that is a must-see holding a real food market, with different stalls: some active",
          "This is a historical building of old central market which now holds shops for fresh groceries, fruits and vegetables, flowers, and cooked food, including candy.",
          "Typical European urban market. The usual assortment of meat, seafood, fruits and vegetable vendors. More impressive in the evening when it is illuminated.",
          "The designs of the \u201cCentral Market\u201d are dating from the year 1895 and are from the hand of the architect \u201cF\u00e9lix Navarro P\u00e9rez\u201d who was native Aragon, this in order to replace the old market who was kept in the open air on the \u201cPlaza del Mercado\u201d. They could finish the building",
          "A large indoor market, all sorts of meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, from the average to the beautiful, and always those large tomatoes. Delicious. Open mornings till 2, evenings 5 till 8. Fun to see!",
          "It was a total surprise for us that most of the Markets were closed. Other than that, we found many small shops and they sell fresh fruit and vegetables.",
          "I've seen many fruit/meat markets in my time, but found this a little disappointing. On my initial visit there were several stalls that were closed up. I returned the following day, but a little later on, to find shops still closed up. There was certainly the usual meat,",
          "We've been in Mercados in many places throughout Europe. This just does not compare to to most of them. I realize that this is not a tourist attraction, but where the locals shop, however we were hoping for a much larger variety of fresh products. We found fresh seafood,",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n.

          "An extremely modern attraction. Located near the old train station. Be sure to go here. Highly recommend!!!",
          "An AV presentation amidst the preserved ruins transports you to the days when the town was called Caesaraugusta. This along with models of the port and form are very instructive. We found this museum better done than museums in Italy and elsewhere. There are four roman museums",
          "Very interesting Museum. Self guided with a hand held audio guide. Roman remains are well displayed and explained. Free entry for over 65\u2019s - take proof! Photocopy of passport sufficient for entry, but if you want an audio guide you need to leave something of value - passport,",
          "it's worth visiting, very well maintained, small gem hidden in the tight old streets of the old city",
          "As impressive as it was to learn of the achievements of ancient Zaragoza, especially where public waterworks were concerned, it is just as impressive to witness the extent to which modern Zaragozans have gone to preserve the antiquity. Beautiful displays of ancient life.",
          "Nice collection, history roman empire. just walking distance from Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar",
          "The museum is not too big, but not too small either. It's a must visit while you're in the city center imho. The remains of the Roman culture with detailed descriptions of the daily life make it quite an unique experience.",
          "You can see the actual remains of the city and also a model thta gives you an idea of how people lived in the Roman times",
          "I was surprised by the extent of the excavations, right under the main plaza. Attached museum is very informative. A must if you're interested in Zaragoza's Roman past.",
          "I didn't really know much about Zaragoza and was surprised to learn that it was an old Roman city, established in the name of Caesar Augustus from whom the final name of the city was derived. This small museum gives you one picture of what the city looked like in Roman times.",
          "Museo del Foro de Caesaraugusta is located in the old part of the city and it is one of the four museums about roman history of Caesaraugusta, the name of Zaragoza in the Roman period. It is the second biggest museum and here you can see some 3D-expositions and ruins of this",
          "We try to see everything a place has to offer when we visit, so we bought the combined ticket for four related attractions - the Roman forum, port, baths and theatre. It cost 7 euros and I went free as a pensioner (they're very good like that in Spain).",
          "This & the Roman Amphitheatre were the best out of the 4 sights you can see if you buy a 7 euro combined ticket to the Caesaugusta museums. I'd only go if you have plenty of time in Zaragoza & have seen the other major sights. This mainly shows the way the city received fresh",
          "Despite the lack of a movie in English....kids and parents enjoyed the visit. Highly recommended. But, I would recommend visiting the theatre (no need to pay to get in), the thermal baths and the port",
          "This is an amazing depth down underground to the old market, you can learn in Spanish, French and English about the history of the Market the raise and fall, You can also have a look around the old hallways and water chambers, and is part of the CesarAugusta tour.",
          "There is not much to see at the Forum. You have to pay an entrance fee to see a few stones. The better Roman history sites are the Amphitheatre (not far from the Forum) and the Roman Wall (other end of Plaza del Pilar). Save you money for some tapas and skip the Forum. The",
          "An interesting museum. Well presented with friendly and helpful staff. Video presentation is well done and very effective. a little more English content on the item label would have been useful.",
          "Very well presented collection of Roman artifacts and lifestyle during the Caesaraugusta period. Small individual cabinets explaining very well life in Roman times...excellent examples of lead piping and how they made them...models of what the city would have looked",
          "Worth visiting if raining and wonderful history of Roman life in this part of Spain. Superb architecture below the city streets.",
          "The second of the four municipal museums tracing Zaragoza's Roman past, this one is another winner. The entrance is a modern stone and glass pavilion that pops out of the ground in front of the cathedral Seo; it turns out that a large Roman forum was built on the same site",
          "A small but interesting Roman Museum in the centre of the Museum. Interesting film introduction which was all in Spanish but some of the exhibits have English translations",
          "The site is quite nice, but each 30 mins they present a video where they explain the history of CaesarAugusta until it became Zaragoza, and the video is great",
          "First of all this is an underground site, so don't look for Roman ruins as I did. ))) The combination ticket includes 4 sites and costs \u20ac7. Three of them are underground sites. The forum is the largest although it's small which is understandable as it must be pretty hard to",
          "This was the unexpected surprise attraction of Zaragoza, so much history here I had no idea! Excellent presentation Center, informative movie, and a break from the heat too! Take the time, buy the pass for all 4 sites, learn about how important this city was thru the years. Bravo",
          "The Forum museum makes astonishingly good and interesting use of some rather basic remains, and we were impressed at how much thought had been put into presentation. There were even handsome scale reconstructions of parts of the Forum in wood, made to be handled, with labels in",
          "This is certainly the best of the Roman museums in Zaragoza - the biggest and most informative. It has a reasonable amount of information available in English, although the opening film wasn't available in English when we went there. The lay out inside is very interesting as you",
          "A history museum under ZARAGOZA's main square, set on the very archeological ruins of the Cesarea Augusta roman colony. Visit begins with a 20 min movie (english or spanish depending on the audinece) about the history of the colony, told from the perspective of the EBRO river,",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators.

          "It was fun. The price is 1 euro and you can go with an elevator to have a nice view. When you have time and want to see the whole city , it's fun.",
          "You really get a lift when you visit the tower above the basilica. The entrance to the tower is hard to find but it\u2019s inside the basilica through a back corner door. Not well marked. When you get to the top of the lift you still have to walk up a couple more levels but the view",
          "Perhaps one of the most interesting things to do in Zaragoza. Go up till the top, its a great view..",
          "After finding the Basilica underwhelming the Torre Del Pilar was brilliant. The fastest lift up so far and staircase to the top. Fantastic panoramic views from the top. Would definitely do this again.",
          "We were so glad we did this. Only 3 euro to go up in the lift - and the views are fab. Even just seeing the beautiful roof of the basilica more closely was worth the price.",
          "Good access, either by private or public transportation, nice surroundings, attractive schedule of masses during the whole week. Deserves a visit, minimum 2 hours, but avoid Sundays (lots of tourists).",
          "The \u00a33 to go up by elevator are a must - you need to go into the church and follow an arrow, and don\u2019t worry as the lift isn\u2019t closed (the chap who sells tickets also goes up and down). After the end of the lift ride you still go up a few more flights, but mind that the landing",
          "From the top of the tower there are amazing views of the city and the river. There is a lift to take you most of the way. It is a little scarey for visitors with vertigo",
          "We enjoyed a trip by elevator up this tower, from where there were lovely views. We also climbed from the elevator lobby up to the top of the tower, though the views here are more obscured by protective netting. Still quite exciting!",
          "For a few Euros one is able to go to the top of one of the towers to view the piazza and surrounding areas as well as take some fantastic photos. A must !!!",
          "cheap ticket, amazing view, modern structure of the elevator all in glass and steel, clean and well maintained. A to-do thing, not to be missed",
          "The tower is unique, fortunately I followed the hint from the lady in the tourist office, the best view is actually from the platform where the elevator arrives, no viewin obstacles I.e. no windows or such but the rather narrow stairs all the way to the top are quite a bit of an",
          "I had a few hours to walk around in Zaragoza on my own and heard from a colleague that it was possible to go up into the church towers. The entrance was hidden in the far end of the church towards the street (through a big door and out into what seemed like a dead end). But I\u2019m",
          "The view at the top was good and we can see the whole city. After the elevator we climbed up a few stairs to the top. If the top is without glass it will be even better.",
          "This is a must do activity. There is a lift upto half way, and then stairs to the top enclosed area. The views are amazing right to the Pyrenees in fine weather. As we went up in very hot weather it was extremely hot at the top but the views made it very worthwhile.",
          "Well, I have rated it very good since if you\u2019re in Zaragoza this is sort of a must see. The entrance to the ascensor tower is through the doors closest to the water feature in the plaza (that looks all cracked). We did try to go the wrong way at first, but there\u2019s an info desk",
          "Worth the 3\u00a3 to visit the top of this basilica. It\u2019s an amazing view of a beautiful city! There are quite a few stairs to get to the very top and the case narrows as you go higher so just keep that in mind. The view from where the elevator let\u2019s you off is quite adequate if you",
          "The views of the Ebro River and the city of Zaragoza are fantastic from atop the Basilica tower. Be aware there is very little signage pointing you to the place, however, so when you enter through any of the entrances on the long SW side of the Basilica, you will need to go all",
          "The first challenge is to find the entrance. You must go into the Basilica and walk to the far right hand corner, where you find a wooden door, which you go through, turn right and the lift is in front of you through a small tunnel. The second challenge. When we arrived there",
          "Nice view of the city and the Basilica itself, costs 3E. Be prepared to also walk some stairs to get to the very top. Entrance is from inside the Basilica.",
          "A must-do element to your trip. Unparalleled views of Zaragoza, including the roof of the basilica. There is the option of walking to the very top but the view from the viewing platform is more than sufficient.",
          "A highlight of our trip to Zaragoza. We went up in the glass elevator and went up the metal modern staircase and spiral staircase to the viewing platform. I am normally a bit funny with heights but there are rails to hold on to up the spiral staircase and the steps are not",
          "We went to the lift to see the view, but the way up was also kind of spectacular with the glass elevator taking you up at high speed and glimpses of the view. Once up there, you still have to climb a few stairs including a winding staircase to arrive at a very small platform -",
          "Zaragoza was an ok city to visit. Small and lots of things closed at lunch time. This was the highlight. Beautiful building and panoramic views.",
          "You pay 3\u20ac to take a lift up to enjoy the windy but amazing view of the cathedral and the city. You can also go up another set of stairs to see even further. Unfortunately there is glass infront of the view but it's still worth the effort!",
          "Afraid of heights, but managed the elevator ... left the additional spiral staircase to the upper level to my husband ... the photographs that he produced were wonderful perspectives of the beautiful tiled domes of the cathedral; the rooftops of the city; views over the River",
          "For 3 euro, you get a quick ride in a glass elevator, but it does not take you all the way to the top. You then climb a spiral staircase to the cupola. The glass, which was pretty dirty the day I was there, makes it hard to get the photos you would hope for.",
          "The glass fronted lift takes you up one of the towers of the Basilica del Pilar, after which you can climb the stairs for an even better view of the river, old bridge and city. There is a small charge but well worth it - the views are spectacular.",
          "A friend told me that it was really worth going up the North Tower of the Basilica del Pilar to get a great view of the city and she wasn't wrong! It costs 3 euros and well worth it. You go up by elevator to a certain point, then from there you have to do a lot of climbing",
          "The lift trip is great. Great views across the city. But if you don't climb stairs you won't get right to the top. Lots of stairs including, at the end, a spiral staircase. If you're up for a climb though, the views are worth",
          "I\u00b4m originally from Zaragoza and I had never been here before. I took some friends from UK and it was great! Th price is good 3euros and you can enjoy one of the best views of Zaragoza. I recommend it!",

          "We looked around the Basilica (impressive, but not really my kind of thing) and then went up the tower. It gives you a spectacular view of the city and the Basilica itself and provides a great perspective. Not sure about the glass floor half way up the stairs - made me feel a",
          "Amazing vue from there. We had the chance to go up at night for free. If you can, opt to go during \"la noche en blanco\" in June. All museums of Zaragoza are opened until midnight this day, there are a looot a people coming from everywhere, this is a good way to enjoy this city",
          "Come here to get an overview, the city is really well seen from this height. There may be a wait, but it's worth it.",
          "Well worth 3 Euros to climb to the top and enjoy the views over lovely Zaragoza! The stairs at the top were easy to climb but optional; the point at which the lift stopped gave an ideal viewing platform.",
          "An impressive panoramic view! A beautiful place to take photos! Totally worth the ticket to use the ascensor!",
          "It only costs 3 Euros and the elevator is modern and fast. There are an additional 105 steps to the very top, that has glass covered openings (for safety, probably), that offer a stupendous view of the Ebro River and of Zaragoza. It is delightful during the day and I can only",
          "Great option for the whole family. Once you recover from the vertigo induced by a glass step over the elevator shaft, you're in the comfort and protection of the enclosed viewing area.",
          "This was 3 euro entry, not 2 as someone else said. (the museum is 2 euro). You go into a glass elevator & are whisked away at speed to the top. Both the up & down made my stomach jump. At the top is a platform, maybe 1.5m wide, thats open to the outside elements. Not sure",
          "We went early and had the advantage of sharing the experience with only one other person. The main viewing platform is reached by lift, and the area is open so great for photography. there is a higher viewing point which is reached by a modern spiral stairway. At this higher",
          "We had to wait several minutes in the queue but it was worth it. Price is \u20ac2 and you get to enjoy one of the best views in Zaragoza. In a good day without fog, you can see as far as the Pyrenees on the North, and follow the river path both from West to East within the city. The",
          "This is one of the best parts of visiting the basilica although obviously the religious splendour is a must see first. The views from the tower are just spectacular - the river, the countryside around the city, and the rooftops of Zaragoza, Go right to the top if you have the",
          "The entrance is quite cheap. I think that I paid for both only 6 euros. At first you have to take the elevator and at the top you can take the stairs if you want to climb higher. Its quite difficult to take some pictures from the top because you have some thick class infront of",
          "We visited just after it reopened at 4pm - very quiet. Modern lift topped by a series of modern staircases ending with a rather tight spiral staircase that starts on a glass floor section! Fantastic vies from the very top but you have to look through glass windows which weren't",
          "I actually did not know I was afraid of heights until I took this Ascensor. I got a great picture, so I recommend it. However, if you have issues with heights, beware",
          "When you go to the Basilica del Pilar, take a ride up in the Ascensor del Pilar (an elevator up one tower). You will see a great view of the city of Zaragoza.",
          "The platform at the top offers a great view of the roof of the Basilica, the Ebro river and Zaragoza in general. A bit crowded at the top platform, but well worth the small entry fee.",
          "Take the lift to the top and walk the spiral staircase, the most amazing views of the river and town are from here. Would recommend to everyone visiting the city",
          "The lift is located just to the rear of the Basilica (just outside the back door). For 3 \u20ac you can get to the first platform in the tower where you have amazing views across Zaragoza (on a clear day you can see the entire city). You can then climb to the very top of the tower",
          "Well worth the low price tag to go up the elevator and then the long flight of stairs to get perfect views of the city of Zaragoza and the roof of the Basilica. Even if you don't like heights (unless you have extreme fear), you should be able to go up the elevator to the first",
          "The open-side elevator takes you in no time to the top of the tower. If you want to reach the highest point, you need to take a few steps through some narrow alleys, which is a nice experience. Once you are up you can look around the city and than you see how big it actually is.",
          "This was on my list of must do in Zaragoza and it was definitely worth the stairs. Chose a great day and had amazing views.",
          "It's a cheap activity with no time limit. As long as you aren't afraid of heights, or small narrow spaces, then you will be fine! Lovely views on a clear sunny day. Don't go on a busy day (weekend) as it can be a bit sardine like. The roof of the basillica is lovely!",
          "This provides the best view in the city and if not scared of heights is a must for all visitors to church. The lifts takes you almost to the top and offers a great view for those not able to mange the spiral staircase to the summit.",
          "The elevator only takes you part of the way up; from there you have to climb stairs if you want to go to the top of the tower. The floor around the staircase is clear, so you can see all the way down--great if you love heights, but not so fun if you are prone to vertigo. The",
          "Actually I just reviewed this as part of my review of the Basilica...silly me. This is great fun, but beware if you suffer even the slightest vertigo you will be wishing you hadn't got in the lift.",
          "We arrived here at night and we're lucky enough to have a hotel right next to it. So, we first walked around it at night and took some amazing romantic pictures. The next day we went I side to see the amazing architecture. This church is still in service and free. Be",
          "Well worth a visit for the great views. The lift doesn't go to the top and you climb a spiral staircase for the last 10m or so. Cost 3 euros.",
          "Beautiful large cathedral . Some amazing ceilings! Beautiful tiled roof. Well worth taking a trip up the glass elevator...... Spectacular views from the top!",
          "For 3 Euros you get a spectacular view if Zaragosa- totally worth it on a beautiful day! I didn't realize what I was doing till the elevator door opened and 'voila!'",
          "The elevator takes you most of the way and then there are some stairs for the final part of your ascent. This should be one of the first places to visit when one goes to Zaragoza for the spectacular views and as a tool to orient you within this city whereas many of the places",
          "The price of this is crazy, I would expect more for such fantastic views. We visited in May, which was pretty quiet, so I'm not sure how busy it would get during the warmer months. We went first thing in the morning and had the polar to ourselves. The views are unbeatable!",
          "Well worth the extra effort! Although the Basilica itself is absolutely stunning and humbling, spend the 3 Euros for the lift: incredible views of the city, river and mountains",
          "Cost 3 euro but a lift goes most of the way fabulous views worth a visit out can stand on a glass floor and look down to the ground",
          "This is a great thing to do with family or friends. It's cheap and the views are fenomenal from the tip. It takes a bit of searching to find the entrance and the hours are a bit crazy., but otherwise no complaints!",
          "Fortunately I had a friend to explain the significance of this site to me. The Plaza is quite spectacular; the church is ancient, steeped in history, well worth a visit, even if you aren't particularly religious.",
          "Ons of the few places where you can see the whole city around you. The lift takes you up to the first view point. There after you climb the stairs to get to the top! It has magnificently views of the city and the landscape beyond.",

          "The Ascensor del Pilar provides an amazing view of Zaragoza. The lift takes you up and down most of the way, with the top reached by some modern, sturdy stairs. Tip 1: the lift is accessed outside of the basilica. Tip 2: At the base of the modern spiral stairs for the final part",
          "I was there trying to show some visit the nice views of Zaragoza and Ebro area. Problem is that it only takes cash and no credit or debit card was accepted. Next time...",
          "You get to the tower by going through the basilica and through the back door. There were signs that direct you. You start off by going up a lift and then a short flight of stairs. The views are 360 degrees and extensive. The glass is kept clean so you get great photos. It can",
          "If you are visiting the Basilica or just want an ariel view of Zaragoza, find the elevator at the back of the Basilica and take a ride up. You get better views if you climb the upper stairs.",

          "You can find this tower entrance from outside the Cathedral on the river side or from inside in the north west corner. You pay your \u20ac3 to ride up to a scenic level for nice views and for those intrepid explorers walk up to the very top of the tower. picture of the final",
          "Entrance is situated just inside the Basilica (on the river side). For a couple of euro take the lift up the tower then walk up the spiral staircase for the best views of Zaragoza.",
          "Worth more than the 3 euro price . Great photo op. I didn't have any line . 5-10 min viewing time is more than sufficient. It's behind the Pilar church. Important to contribute as Pilar is free.",
          "Go up the north tower of the Basilica, first by elevator and then stairs. Fine views down on the tile rooftops and of the Ebro River. Well worth the minimal cost. Anyone but the seriously handicapped can do this.",
          "The entry to the lift which takes you up one of the towers of the Basilica is located on the corner of the Basilica closest to Puente de Santiago. You can arrive from outside on the street or access by walking through the Basilica and following the signs. When we arrived at",
          "Having read the reviews we decided we would like to visit this. We entered the basilica and tried to find the entrance but just could not find it! We are not really comfortable in places of worship, so maybe we just did not look properly! Can't really say any more.",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

          "If you want to learn something about Goya other than from a book visit the museum and enjoy some of his works and many of the etchings he did. There is much more besides and it will give you an understanding of the conflict between Spain and the Emperor Napoleon",
          "Loved learning about how Goya developed his art over time.",
          "If Flemish art and Goya is your piece of cake go there. I could have spent my time better somewhere else.",
          "Need many hours here",
          "It was my dream and I got there. So happy. Everyone must see that with own eyes",
          "Worth seeing if visiting Zaragoza. There are about a dozen paintings of Goya\u2019s, his best work is in el Prado.",
          "Una maravilla! Inolvidable! Don't miss it while in Zaragossa or Aragon. Like a time travel! Right now you can see works of marvelous Spanish painter Lita Cabellut too.",
          "Very informative. Enjoyed the artworks on display. Recommend to get an audio guide to have a better appreciation.",
          "Great works of art of the local artistic genius Goya :)",
          "Nicely laid out and well documented. Excellent collection of Goya prints. Good Goya context but his works are elsewhere really.  Can't hide the large amount of average non-Goya work.",
          "The Goya museum costs 6 euro to enter and your enjoyment will be highly linked to how much you like classical art.",
          "It is a nice visit if you go to Zaragoza",
          "Excellent museum, excellent audio guide, but Goyas greatest works are in the Prado.",
          "Not my favourite museum, it's very \"silent and static\" if it makes sense. There is a room full of small satirical drawings which is very interesting.",
          "Nice place to visit but only if you appreciate art else don't waste your time. Backpacks not allowed. They will give u free locker to store it.\n\nStart from 3rd floor and walk your way down.",
          "Interesting. Make sure you catch the video documentary in the basement. Very eye opening.",
          "Very nice museum if you like art. It has got 3 floors. One with Pre era Goya paintings, one with Goya\u2019s paintings & prints and another one with post Goya paintings.\nThere\u2019s also an exhibition of Lita Cabellut on the ground floor at the moment. Worth visiting it.",
          "It was nice, but thought that they were more of Goya more famous art. Good price to get in , only 6 Euros",
          "We were on a University trip, we could not miss out this museum! It is well structured with clear directions and descriptions (even in English). Goya's work are amazing, worth a see!",
          "Very interesting and loved the short film oh goyas life",
          "Beautiful building housing great collection particularly Etchings",
          "Excellent displays of his prints and paintings.",
          "So this is an excellent little gallery of art, mostly focused on Goya, but there's some good exhibits about what came before and after him too. The best part, though, is the selection of prints he made. I never knew about this side of \u2026",
          "A very interesting museum. I liked the wide range of works from before Goya, his work, and then works by painters who were influenced by him. The Goya sketches seem modern given the current trend for surrealistic films. He was unique.",
          "Definitely a museum to visit in Zaragoza. Loved the \"grabados\", especially those with war scenes, the closest similarity to a modern war photographer.",
          "Beautiful museum to wander around if you are interested in Goya. Other 2 in our group were. Ask for audio guide. It wasn't offered to us and we found out afterwards it was available. If you do the 2 euro city tour first you get a discount here. Didn't know that either!  Do it in that order.",

          "Beautiful exposure to Baroque style and Rocco style , also Impressionist style of painting",
          "I was hoping for more Goya in Goya museum, but worth visiting anyway. Modest collection of originals, decent collection of prints.",
          "Great exhibit. If you like Goya a 'mast see' otherwise an interesting discovery of facts, values, culture.",
          "Enjoyed viewing the collection. Museum is not so big, but full of beautiful works and info",
          "A MUST. Well explained (in Spanish) and good collection, easy to understand and pick up the meaning of Goya's work. Cloakroom and toilets which are a plus in this city.",
          "Great museum, where you can discover Goya's art. Particularly captivating section of Caprichos.",
          "Small museum, perhaps only would appeal to Goya fans. Did have a good collection of Goya's etchings but very few paintings by him",

          "I had no clue about this guy before, but I looked at his paintings and pictures and I was totally amazed. I would say he definitely put life in his drawings. Worth visiting if you have time in Zaragoza.",

          "I loved this museum and there is a great deal of information about this archaeological site. The models of the theatre provide a great visual as to what the theatre originally looked like. The amphitheater is also set up with markers in such a way that it is easy to envision",
          "From the outside it's hard to know how much there is to see! There is A LOT! The museum has laid out the history of the teatro, including its discovery, very well. They have a number of video and audio entertainment, most of which is strictly in Spanish. There are a number",

          "I was interested in the theatre. It is well excavated, very well presented, and the building that protects it is modern and well thought-out. You really get an insight into how the Romans built, and also the scale of the theatre. But, let's face it, many of you may have seen",
          "Walked around outside and then found the main entrance at the front and found it was free so we went in and thoroughly enjoyed it (maybe even more because it was free?!). Lots of information about how they discovered the ruins in the 70's and what the city looked like in Roman",

          "The museum at the Teatro Romano is recommended if you are staying a few days in Saragossa, but I don't think you should go out of your way to see it unless you are really interested in iberian roman-era buildings. The theatre itself is pretty much in ruins and these you can see",

        "wiki": "Mud\u00e9jar architecture of Aragon is an aesthetic trend in the Mud\u00e9jar style, which is centered in Aragon (Spain) and has been recognized in some representative buildings as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nThe chronology of the Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar occupies 12th to the 17th century and includes more than a hundred architectural monuments located predominantly in the valleys of the Ebro, Jal\u00f3n and Jiloca.\nThe first manifestations of Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar have two origins: on the one hand, a palatial architecture linked to the monarchy, which amends and extends the Aljafer\u00eda Palace maintaining Islamic ornamental tradition, and on the other hand, a tradition which develops Romanesque architecture using brickwork rather than masonry construction and which often displays Hispanic-rooted ornamental tracery. Examples of the latter type of Mud\u00e9jar architecture can be seen in churches in Daroca, which were started in stone and finished off in the 13th century with Mud\u00e9jar brick panels.\nFrom the construction point of view, the Mud\u00e9jar architecture in Aragon preferably adopts functional schemes of Cistercian Gothic, but with some differences. Buttresses are often absent, especially in the apses which characteristically have an octagonal floor plan with thick walls that can hold the thrust from the roof and which provide space to highlight brick decorations. On the other hand, buttresses are often a feature of the naves, where they may be topped by turrets, as in the style of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar. There may be side chapels which are not obvious from the exterior. Churches in neighborhoods (such as San Pablo of Zaragoza) or small towns do not usually have aisles, but locations for additional altars are provided by chapels between the nave buttresses. It is common for these side chapels to have a closed gallery or \u00e1ndite (walkway), with windows looking to the outside and inside of the building. This constitution is called a church-fortress, and his prototype could be the church of Montalb\u00e1n.\nTypically the bell towers show extraordinary ornamental development, the structure being inherited from the Islamic minaret: quadrangular with central pier whose spaces are filled via a staircase approximation vaults, as in the Almohad minarets. On this body stood the tower, usually polygonal. There are also examples of octagonal towers.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\n\nIn 1986, Unesco declared the whole Mud\u00e9jar complex of Teruel a World Heritage Site, which was extended in 2001 to include other Aragonese Mudejar monuments:\n\nThe description of the importance given so appropriated:\n\nThe development in the twelfth century Mudejar art in Aragon is a consequence of the political, social and cultural conditions that prevailed in Spain after the Reconquista. This art, influenced by Islamic tradition, also reflects various contemporary European styles, particularly Gothic. Present until the beginning of the seventeenth century, is characterized by extremely refined and inventive use of brick and glazed tiles in architecture, especially in church steeples.\n\u2014Aragonese Mudejar statement on the official website of UNESCO.\nThe justification for the statement is supported by the standard IV of the same organization:\nCriterion IV:\n\nAs an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant period in human history. \u2014Selection criteria (UNESCO, World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Mud\u00e9jar buildings in Aragon: include non-World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography used ==\nGonzalo Borr\u00e1s Gualis, Mudejar art in Teruel, Teruel Studies Institute, 1990.

It was built on the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred in 303 AD. The Basilica of Santa Engracia is located at Plaza de Santa Engracia. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Basilica of Santa Engracia is believed to have been built on the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred in 303 AD. Early in the fourth century, a tomb was built on the site of the Christian-Roman necropolis. Around 609 the Abbey of Santa Engracia was established to house the relics of Saint Engratia and the many martyrs of Saragossa.The Abbey was demolished around 1492 when Ferdinand II of Aragon founded the Hieronymus monastery of Santa Engracia. After his election to the papacy, Pope Hadrian VI passed through Zaragoza on his way to Rome, spending Holy Week at Santa Egratia. King Philip III visited in 1599.\nThe monastery church was largely destroyed in the Siege of Saragossa (1809) during the Spanish War of Independence, with only the crypt and the facade being left.Pope John Paul II honored the church with the designation of a minor basilica on the occasion of his visit in 1982.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe fa\u00e7ade was begun around 1511 by Gil Morlanes El Viejo and completed by his son five years later.  It was modified between 1754-1759 after part of the church collapsed. Part of the fa\u00e7ade is all that remains of the monastery church, when the present building was constructed between 1891-1899.\nThe most significant elements of the crypt are the two Early Christian sarcophagi of the fourth century, which were discovered in 1737.  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

          "Take time to look at the detail in the flooring & look back at this water feature, quite unlike anything I have seen been. There is Zaragoza's very own leaning tower in the background & this feature neatly finishes of the Plaza into a great mix of interesting & impressive",
          "This fountain at one end of the Plaza del Pilar is unique and especially beautiful at night. Children will enjoy getting wet there on hot summer days and the sound of the water is always soothing at the end of a hectic workday. But as I mentioned in my review regarding the Plaza",

          "I like that the fountain is next to the cathedral and that you can visit both simultanously. The architecture is very extraordinary and you won't see this kind somewhere else again. So if you visit the Pilar you should also take a look at the fountain of course",

          "Yes, there's a fine idea but in my opinion this modern fountain does not fit well in Plaza del Pilar. And it's even worse when looking from Plaza Cesar Augusto (there's an entrance to the public toilets). To get a complete view you need to look from basilica's tower.",

        "wiki": "Francisco Franco Bahamonde (, Spanish: [f\u027ean\u02c8\u03b8isko \u02c8f\u027ea\u014bko]; 4 December 1892 \u2013 20 November 1975) was a Spanish general who led the Nationalist forces in overthrowing the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War and thereafter ruled over Spain from 1939 to 1975 as a dictator, assuming the title Caudillo. This period in Spanish history, from the Nationalist victory to Franco's death, is commonly known as Francoist Spain or the Francoist dictatorship. \nBorn in Ferrol, Spain into an upper-class military family, Franco served in the Spanish Army as a cadet in the Toledo Infantry Academy from 1907 to 1910. While serving in Morocco, he rose through the ranks to become brigadier general in 1926, aged 33, becoming the youngest general in Spain. Two years later Franco became the director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. As a conservative and monarchist, Franco regretted the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the Republican Army. His career redoubled after the right-wing CEDA and PRR won the 1933 election empowering him to lead the suppression of the 1934 uprising in Asturias. Franco was briefly elevated to Chief of Army Staff before the 1936 election moved the leftist Popular Front into power, relegating him to the Canary Islands. After initial reluctance, he joined the July 1936 military coup which, after failing to take Spain, sparked the Spanish Civil War.\nDuring the war, he commandeered Spain's colonial army in Africa and after the death of much of the rebel leadership became his faction's only leader, later appointed Generalissimo and Head of State in 1936. He consolidated all nationalist parties into the FET y de las JONS (creating a one-party state). Three years later the Nationalists declared victory which extended Franco's dictatorship over Spain through a period of repression of political opponents. His dictatorship's use of forced labor, concentration camps, and executions led to between 30,000 and 50,000 deaths. Combined with wartime killings, this brings the death toll of the White Terror to between 100,000 and 200,000. In post-civil-war Spain, Franco ruled with more power than any Spanish leader before or since, and developed a cult of personality around his rule by founding the Movimiento Nacional.  During World War II he maintained Spanish neutrality but supported the Axis \u2014 whose members Italy and Germany had supported him during the Civil War \u2014 in various ways, damaging the country's international reputation.\nDuring the start of the Cold War, Franco lifted Spain out of its mid-20th century economic depression through technocratic and economically liberal policies, presiding over a period of rampant growth known as the \"Spanish miracle\". At the same time, his regime transitioned from being totalitarian to authoritarian with limited pluralism and became a leader in the anti-Communist movement, garnering support from the West, particularly the United States. The dictatorship softened and Luis Carrero Blanco became Franco's \u00e9minence grise.  Carrero Blanco's role expanded after Franco started struggling with Parkinson's disease in the 1960s. In 1973 Franco resigned as prime minister \u2013 separated from the head of state office since 1967 \u2013 due to advanced age and illness, but remained in power as the latter and commander-in-chief. Franco died in 1975, aged 82, and was entombed in the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos. He restored the monarchy in his final years, being succeeded by Juan Carlos as King of Spain, who, in turn, led the Spanish transition to democracy.\nThe legacy of Franco in Spanish history remains controversial as the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved highly adaptable, which enabled wide-sweeping social and economic reform, while consistent pursuits during his reign centered on highly centralised government, authoritarianism, nationalism, national Catholicism, anti-freemasonry, and anti-communism.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFrancisco Franco Bahamonde was born on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in the province of El Ferrol, Galicia. He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo; Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the saint day of his birth. Franco was born into a seafaring family of Andalusian ancestry.\n\nAfter relocating to Galicia, the family was involved in the Spanish Navy, and over the span of two centuries produced naval officers for six uninterrupted generations (including several admirals), down to Franco's father Nicol\u00e1s Franco y Salgado Ara\u00fajo (22 November 1855 \u2013 22 February 1942).His mother, Mar\u00eda del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (15 October 1865 \u2013 28 February 1934), was from an upper-middle-class Roman Catholic family. Her father, Ladislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port of El Ferrol. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in El Ferrol. The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, Nicol\u00e1s and Ram\u00f3n, and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar and Mar\u00eda de la Paz. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was naval officer and diplomat who  married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello. Ram\u00f3n was an internationally known aviator, a Freemason originally with leftist political leanings. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.Franco's father was a naval officer who reached the rank of vice admiral (intendente general). When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid following a reassignment and ultimately abandoned his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel Raza under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the Spanish\u2013American War the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the Spanish Army. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in Toledo. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average; though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests, his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming in at position 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel. At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912. Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African protectorate provoked the Second Melillan campaign in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of Riffian rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish military officers, and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either la caja o la faja (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer.  In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed regulares: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as shock troops. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n. The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.\nIn 1916, aged 23 as a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at El Biutz. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only one testicle. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.His recovery was seen by native troops in Africa as a spiritual event \u2013 they believed Franco to be blessed with baraka, or protected by God. He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted Cruz Laureada de San Fernando. Both proposals were denied citing the 23-year-old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead Franco received the Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class.With that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray, a histrionic but charismatic officer, founded the Spanish Foreign Legion, on similar lines as the French Foreign Legion. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the Rif War, on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered a crushing defeat at Annual from the Republic of the Rif led by the Abd el-Krim brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of Melilla after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a lieutenant colonel, he was made commander of the Legion.\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988). Following his honeymoon Franco was summoned to Madrid to be presented to King Alfonso XIII. This and other occasions of royal attention would mark him during the Republic as a monarchical officer. \nDisappointed with the plans for a strategic retreat from the interior to the African coastline by Primo de Rivera, Franco wrote in April 1924 for Revista de Tropas Coloniales that he would disobey orders of retreat from a superior. He also held a tense meeting with Primo de Rivera in July 1924. According to fellow africanista, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, Franco visited him on 21 September 1924 to propose him to lead a coup d'etat against Primo. Yet, at the end, Franco orderly complied, taking part in the retreat of Spanish soldiers from Xaouen in late 1924, and thus he earned a promotion to Colonel.Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at Al Hoceima (Spanish: Alhucemas) in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived Republic of the Rif. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him, and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with Major-General Joe Sweeney of the Irish Army, one of the youngest generals in Europe. On 14 September 1926, Franco and Polo had a daughter, Mar\u00eda del Carmen. Franco would have a close relationship with his daughter and was a proud parent, though his traditionalist attitudes and increasing responsibilities meant he left much of the child-rearing to his wife. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army cadets, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of 12 April 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain, but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals. The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the Second Spanish Republic. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic. But the closing of the Academy in June by the provisional War Minister Manuel Aza\u00f1a was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the Spanish Republic. Aza\u00f1a found Franco's farewell speech to the cadets insulting. In his speech Franco stressed the Republic's need for discipline and respect. Aza\u00f1a entered an official reprimand into Franco's personnel file and for six months Franco was without a post and under surveillance.In December 1931, a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. It included strong provisions enforcing a broad secularisation of the Catholic country, which included the abolishing of Catholic schools and charities, which many moderate committed Catholics opposed. At this point once the constituent assembly had fullfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned. Fearing the increasing popular opposition, the Radical and Socialist majority postponed the regular elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the republican government of Manuel Aza\u00f1a initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would \"modernize\" the country.Franco was a subscriber to the journal of Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, a monarchist organisation, and a firm believer in a supposed Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik conspiracy, or contubernio (filthy cohabitation).  The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.\n\nOn 5 February 1932, Franco was given a command in A Coru\u00f1a. Franco avoided involvement in Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo's attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the Balearic Islands. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted.\nIn 1932 the Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were banned and had all their property confiscated. The army was further reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own.  In June 1933 Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical Dilectissima Nobis, \"On Oppression of the Church of Spain\", raising his voice against the persecution of the Catholic Church in Spain.The elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president Alcal\u00e1-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the Radical Republican Party's Alejandro Lerroux to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year. After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. The entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left.  The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months. A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the Alianza Obrera. The issue was that the Left Republicans identified the Republic not with democracy or constitutional law but a specific set of left-wing policies and politicians. Any deviation, even if democratic, was seen as treasonous. A Catalan state was proclaimed by Catalan nationalist leader Lluis Companys, but it lasted just ten hours. Despite an attempt at a general stoppage in Madrid, other strikes did not endure. This left Asturian strikers to fight alone.In several mining towns in Asturias, local unions gathered small arms and were determined to see the strike through. It began on the evening of 4 October, with the miners occupying several towns, attacking and seizing local Civil and Assault Guard barracks. Thirty four priests, six young seminarists with ages between 18 and 21, and several businessmen and civil guards were summarily executed by the revolutionaries in Mieres and Sama, 58 religious buildings including churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo were burned and destroyed. Franco, already General of Division and aide to the war minister, Diego Hidalgo, was put in command of the operations directed to suppress the violent insurgency. Troops of the Spanish Army of Africa carried this out, with General Eduardo L\u00f3pez Ochoa as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed.\nThe insurgency in Asturias sparked a new era of violent anti-Christian persecutions, initiated the practice of atrocities against the clergy, and sharpened the antagonism between Left and Right. Franco and L\u00f3pez Ochoa (who, prior to the campaign in Asturias, had been seen as a left-leaning officer) emerged as officers prepared to use \"troops against Spanish civilians as if they were a foreign enemy\". Franco described the rebellion to a journalist in Oviedo as, \"a frontier war and its fronts are socialism, communism and whatever attacks civilisation to replace it with barbarism.\" Though the colonial units sent to the north by the government at Franco's recommendation consisted of the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Moroccan Regulares Indigenas, the right-wing press portrayed the Asturian rebels as lackeys of a foreign Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.With this rebellion against established political legitimate authority, the Socialists showed identical repudiation of representative institutional system that anarchists had practiced. The Spanish historian Salvador de Madariaga, an Aza\u00f1a supporter, and an exiled vocal opponent of Francisco Franco is the author of a sharp critical reflection against the participation of the left in the revolt: \u201cThe uprising of 1934 is unforgivable. The argument that Mr Gil Robles tried to destroy the Constitution to establish fascism was, at once, hypocritical and false. With the rebellion of 1934, the Spanish left lost even the shadow of moral authority to condemn the rebellion of 1936.\u201d At the start of the Civil War, L\u00f3pez Ochoa was assassinated. Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from 15 February onwards), and from 19 May 1935, on, Chief of the General Staff.\n\n\n==== 1936 general election ====\n\nIn the end of 1935 President Alcal\u00e1-Zamora manipulated a petty-corruption issue into a major scandal in parliament, and eliminated Alejandro Lerroux, the head of the Radical Republican Party, from premiership. Subsequently, Alcal\u00e1-Zamora vetoed the logical replacement, a majority center-right coalition, led by the CEDA, which would reflect the composition of the parliament. He then arbitrarily appointed an interim prime minister and after a short period announced the dissolution of parliament and new elections.Two wide coalitions formed: the Popular Front on the left, ranging from Republican Union to Communists, and the Frente Nacional on the right, ranging from the centre radicals to the conservative Carlists. On 16 February 1936 the elections ended in a virtual draw, but in the evening leftist mobs started to interfere in the balloting and in the registration of votes distorting the results.  Stanley G. Payne claims that the process was a major electoral fraud, with widespread violation of the laws and the constitution. In line with Payne's point of view, in 2017 two Spanish scholars, Manuel \u00c1lvarez Tard\u00edo and Roberto Villa Garc\u00eda published the result of a major research work where they concluded that the 1936 elections were rigged.On 19 February the cabinet presided by Portela Valladares resigned, with a new cabinet being quickly set up, composed chiefly of members of the Republican Left and the Republican Union and presided by Manuel Aza\u00f1a.Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo, who acquired anti-communism as the axis of his parliamentary speeches, became the speaker of violent propaganda\u2014advocating for a military coup d'\u00e9tat; formulating a catastrophist discourse of a dichotomous choice between \"communism\" or a markedly totalitarian \"National\" State, setting the mood of the masses for a military rebellion. The diffusion of the myth about an alleged Communist coup d'\u00e9tat as well a pretended state of \"social chaos\" became pretexts for a coup. Franco himself along with General Emilio Mola had stirred an Anti-Communist campaign in Morocco.At the same time PSOE's left-wing socialists became more radical. Julio \u00c1lvarez del Vayo talked about \"Spain's being converted into a socialist Republic in association with the Soviet Union\". Francisco Largo Caballero declared that \"the organized proletariat will carry everything before it and destroy everything until we reach our goal\". The country rapidly descended into anarchy. Even the staunch socialist Indalecio Prieto, at a party rally in Cuenca in May 1936, complained: \"we have never seen so tragic a panorama or so great a collapse as in Spain at this moment. Abroad Spain is classified as insolvent. This is not the road to socialism or communism but to desperate anarchism without even the advantage of liberty\".On 23 February Franco was sent to the Canary Islands to serve as the islands' military commander, an appointment perceived by him as a destierro (banishment). Meanwhile, a conspiracy led by General Mola was taking shape.\nInterested in the parliamentary immunity granted by a seat at the Cortes, Franco intended to stand as candidate of the Right Bloc alongside Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera for the by-election in the province of Cuenca programmed for 3 May 1936, after the results of the February 1936 election were annulled in the constituency. But Primo de Rivera refused to run alongside a military officer (and Franco in particular) and Franco himself ultimately desisted on 26 April, one day before the decision of the election authority. By that time, PSOE politician Indalecio Prieto already deemed Franco as \"possible caudillo for a military uprising\".The disenchantment with Aza\u00f1a's ruling continued to grow and was dramatically voiced by Miguel de Unamuno, a republican and one of Spain's most respected intellectuals, who in June 1936 told a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto that President Manuel Aza\u00f1a should \"commit suicide as a patriotic act\".In June 1936, Franco was contacted and a secret meeting was held within La Esperanza forest on Tenerife to discuss starting a military coup. An obelisk commemorating this historic meeting was erected at the site in a clearing at Las Ra\u00edces.Outwardly, Franco maintained an ambiguous attitude until nearly July. On 23 June 1936, he wrote to the head of the government, Casares Quiroga, offering to quell the discontent in the Spanish Republican Army, but received no reply. The other rebels were determined to go ahead con Paquito o sin Paquito (with Paquito or without Paquito; Paquito being a diminutive of Paco, which in turn is short for Francisco), as it was put by Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo, the honorary leader of the military uprising. After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising. The situation reached a point of no return and, as presented to Franco by Mola, the coup was unavoidable and he had to choose a side. He decided to join the rebels and was given the task of commanding the Army of Africa. A privately owned DH 89 De Havilland Dragon Rapide, flown by two British pilots, Cecil Bebb and Hugh Pollard, was chartered in England on 11 July to take Franco to Africa.\nThe coup underway was precipitated by the assassination of the right-wing opposition leader Calvo Sotelo in retaliation for the murder of assault guard Jos\u00e9 Castillo, which had been committed by a group headed by a civil guard and composed of assault guards and members of the socialist militias. On 17 July, one day earlier than planned, the Army of Africa rebelled, detaining their commanders. On 18 July, Franco published a manifesto and left for Africa, where he arrived the next day to take command.\nA week later the rebels, who soon called themselves the Nationalists, controlled a third of Spain; most naval units remained under control of the Republican loyalist forces, which left Franco isolated. The coup had failed in the attempt to bring a swift victory, but the Spanish Civil War had begun. The revolt was remarkably devoid of any particular ideology. The major goal was to put an end to anarchical disorder. Franco himself certainly detested communism, but had no commitment to any ideology: his stand was motivated not by foreign fascism but by Spanish tradition and patriotism.\n\n\n== From the Spanish Civil War to World War II ==\n\nThe Spanish Civil War began in July 1936 and officially ended with Franco's victory in April 1939, leaving 190,000 to 500,000 dead. Despite the Non-Intervention Agreement of August 1936, the war was marked by foreign intervention on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by Fascist Italy, which sent the Corpo Truppe Volontarie, and later by Nazi Germany, which assisted with the Condor Legion. They were opposed by the Soviet Union and communists, socialists, and anarchists within Spain. The United Kingdom and France strictly adhered to the arms embargo, provoking dissensions within the French Popular Front coalition which was led by L\u00e9on Blum, but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the International Brigades (see for example Ken Loach's Land and Freedom).\nSome historians, such as Ernst Nolte, have considered that Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin used the Spanish Civil war as a testing ground for modern warfare, being quickly set up and that the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a European Civil War which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a left/right ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (See Spanish Civil War: other factions) and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of Spanish history.\n\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 pronunciamiento, Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the Spanish Army of Africa. The first days of the insurgency were marked by a serious need to secure control over the Spanish Moroccan Protectorate. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco. Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the Iberian Peninsula, since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the Strait of Gibraltar. He requested help from Benito Mussolini, who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German Junkers Ju 52 aircraft, to initiate an air bridge to Seville, where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in Tetouan on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\nOn the Republican side, in 26 July, just eight days after the revolt had started, an international communist conference was held at Prague to arrange plans to help the Republican Government. It decide to raise an international brigade of 5,000 men and a fund of 1 billion francs to be administered by a commission where Largo Caballero and Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri had prominent roles. At the same time communist parties throughout the world quickly launched a full scale propaganda campaign in support of the Popular Front. The Communist International immediately reinforced its activity, sending to Spain its leader Georgi Dimitrov, and Palmiro Togliatti the chief of the Communist Party of Italy. From August onward, aid from the Soviet Union began; over one ship per day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery, trucks. With the cargo came Soviet agents, technicians, instructors and propagandists.The Communist International immediately started to organize the International Brigades with great care to conceal or minimize the communist character of the enterprise and to make it appear as a campaign on behalf of progressive democracy. Attractive misleading names were deliberately chosen, such as \"Garibaldi\" in Italy or \"Abraham Lincoln\" in the United States.In early August, the situation in western Andalusia was stable enough to allow Franco to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Yag\u00fce, which would march through Extremadura towards Madrid. On 11 August M\u00e9rida was taken, and on 15 August Badajoz, thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV) of fully motorised units (some 12,000 Italians), to Seville, and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the Luftwaffe (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days was the Italian SM.79 and SM.81 bombers, the biplane Fiat CR.32 fighter and the German Junkers Ju 52 cargo-bomber and the Heinkel He 51 biplane fighter.\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of Maqueda (some 80 km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo, which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the Popular Front time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support. Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrived as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments. Soviet officers were in effective charge of military operations on the Madrid front. Kennan believes that this operation was originally conducted in good faith with no other purpose than saving the Republic. Effort was made to encourage the Spanish Communist Party to seize power, but the holding of Alc\u00e1zar was an important morale and propaganda success for the Nationalists, because it is clear that Hitler's primary aim was not a Franco victory but to prolong the war by the active intervention of the Soviet Government as well as that of Italy, Britain, and France in the Civil War.Hitler's policy for Spain was shrewd and pragmatic. His instructions were clear: \"A hundred per cent Franco's victory was not desirable from a German Point of view; rather were we interested in a continuance of the war and in the keeping up of the tension in the Mediterranean.\" Hitler wanted to help Franco just enough to gain his gratitude and to prevent the side supported by the Soviet Union from winning, but not large enough to give the Caudillo a quick victory.By February 1937 the Soviet Union's military help started to taper off, to be replaced by limited economic aid. A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation;  the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism, and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is that Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco. Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a Soviet general, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the general returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots, and tanks to bring about a speedy victory over Franco, but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"it would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The general who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.\n\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo, died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash. In the nationalist zone, \"political life ceased.\" Initially, only military command mattered: this was divided into regional commands (Emilio Mola in the North, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano in Seville commanding Andalusia, Franco with an independent command, and Miguel Cabanellas in Zaragoza commanding Aragon). The Spanish Army of Morocco was itself split into two columns, one commanded by General Juan Yag\u00fce and the other commanded by Colonel Jos\u00e9 Varela.\nFrom 24 July a coordinating junta was established, based at Burgos. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general, it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August. On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas), and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government. He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.Mola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the Carlist monarchists and not at all with the Falange, a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera), nor did he have good relations with Germany. Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles, and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in Alicante (he would be executed a few months later). The desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state. Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and he had also cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy.On 1 October 1936, in Burgos, Franco was publicly proclaimed as General\u00edsimo of the National army and Jefe del Estado (Head of State). When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later on 2 June 1937 (which some believe was an assassination), no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935.\n\n\n=== Military command ===\n\nFranco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war. Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy. After the failed assault on Madrid in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to relieve the garrison at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate: some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for Valencia instead of Catalonia, remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite not always being effective, were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the Condor Legion, but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.The Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:\nthe reckless policies of the Popular Front government in the weeks prior to the war, where it ignored potential dangers and alienated the opposition, encouraging more people to join the rebellion,\nthe Nationalists' superior military cohesion,\nFranco's own leadership, which helped unify the various Nationalist factions, as well as his diplomatic skill, which helped the Nationalists secure military aid from Italy and Germany and keep democracies such as Britain and France out of the war,\nthe Nationalists' effective use of a smaller navy: the Nationalists acquired the most powerful ships in the Spanish fleet and maintained an effective officer corp, while the Republican sailors often liquidated their officers. They used their ships aggressively to hunt down the opposition, whilst the Republicans had a largely passive naval strategy,\nthe greater foreign aid during the war, as well as more efficient use of foreign aid and effective augmentation of Nationalist forces with captured arms and soldiers from the Republicans,\nthe more efficient mobilisation of economic assets,\nthe successful integration of a substantial portion of Republican prisoners-of war-into the Nationalist army (proportionately one the greatest out of any army in any 20th-century European civil war),\nthe Republican disunity and infighting at multiple levels,\nthe destructive consequences of the revolution in the Republican zone: mobilisation was impeded, the Republican image was harmed abroad in democracies, and the war against religion crystallised massive and unremitting Catholic support for the Nationalists,\nthe Nationalists ability to build a larger air force and more effective use of their air force, particularly in supporting ground operations and bombing; the Nationalists also generally enjoyed air superiority from mid-1937 onwards.\n\n\n=== Political command ===\nThe Nazis were disappointed with Franco's resistance to installing fascism. Historian James S. Corum states:\n\nAs an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n\nWhereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.\nFrom 1937 to 1948 the Franco regime was a hybrid as Franco fused the ideologically incompatible national-syndicalist Falange (\"Phalanx\", a fascist Spanish political party founded by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera) and the Carlist monarchist parties into one party under his rule, dubbed Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (FET y de las JONS), which became the only legal party in 1939. Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\". In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points. Franco made himself jefe nacional (National Chief) of the new FET (Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime. In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\" The Falangists' hymn, Cara al Sol, became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er, who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists (Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9) and the Falangists (Manuel Hedilla) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' anti-clericalism in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"Martyrs of the war\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism\".\n\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see History of Madrid) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February Chamberlain's Britain and Daladier's France officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"fifth column\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, Valencia, which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and vowed to never take it up again unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.\nAlthough Germany had recognised the Franco Government, Franco's policy towards Germany was extremely cautious until spectacular German victories at the beginning of the Second World War. An early indication that Franco was going to keep his distance from Germany soon proved true. A rumoured state visit by Franco to Germany did not take place and a further rumour of a visit by Goering to Spain, after he had enjoyed a cruise in the Western Mediterranean, again did not materialise. Instead Goering had to return to Berlin. This proved how right Eden was when he said \"Whatever the final outcome of the strife ... the Spanish people will continue to display that proud independence, that arrogant individualism which is a characteristic of the race. There are twenty-four million reasons why Spain will never for long be dominated by the forces or controlled by the advice of any foreign power.\"During the Civil War and in the aftermath, a period known as the White Terror took place. This saw mass executions of Republican and other Nationalist enemies, standing in contrast to the war-time Red Terror. Historical analysis and investigations estimate the number of executions by the Franco regime during this time to be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead.\nStanley G. Payne approximates 50,000 executions by the Republicans and at least 70,000 executions by the Nationalists during the civil war, with the victory being followed by a further 30,000 executions by the Nationalists. Recent searches conducted with parallel excavations of mass graves in Spain (in particular by the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, ARMH) estimate the total of people executed after the civil war between 15,000 and 35,000.Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz, nominated in 2008 among the experts in the first judicial investigation (conducted by judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n) against the Francoist crimes, as well as historians Josep Fontana and Hugh Thomas, estimate the deaths in the White Terror to be around 150,000 in total. According to Paul Preston, 150,000 wartime civilian executions took place in the Francoist area, as well as 50,000 in the Republican area, in addition to 20,000 civilians executed by the Franco regime after the end of the war. According to Helen Graham, the Spanish working classes became to the Francoist project what the Jews were to the German Volksgemeinschaft.According to Gabriel Jackson and Antony Beevor, the number of victims of the \"White Terror\" (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) only between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000. Beevor \"reckons Franco's ensuing 'white terror' claimed 200,000 lives. The 'red terror' had already killed 38,000.\" Julius Ruiz concludes that \"although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain.\"\n\nDespite the end of the war, guerrilla resistance to Franco, known as \"the Maquis\", occurred in the Pyrenees, carrying out sabotage and robberies against the Francoist regime. Several exiled Republicans also fought in the French resistance against the German occupation in Vichy France during World War II. In 1944, a group of republican veterans from the French resistance invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were quickly defeated. The activities of the Maquis continued well into the 1950s.\nThe end of the war led to hundreds of thousands of exiles, mostly to France, but also to Mexico, Chile, Cuba, and the United States. On the other side of the Pyrenees, refugees were confined in internment camps in France, such as Camp Gurs or Camp Vernet, where 12,000 Republicans were housed in squalid conditions (mostly soldiers from the Durruti Division). The 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs were divided into four categories: Brigadists, pilots, Gudaris and ordinary \"Spaniards\". The Gudaris (Basques) and the pilots easily found local backers and jobs, and were allowed to quit the camp, but the farmers and ordinary people, who could not find relations in France, were encouraged by the French government, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in Ir\u00fan. From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for \"purification\" according to the Law of Political Responsibilities.\nAfter the proclamation by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain of the Vichy France regime, the refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other \"undesirables\", they were sent to the Drancy internment camp before being deported to Nazi Germany. 5,000 Spaniards thus died in Mauthausen concentration camp. The Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, who had been named by the Chilean President Pedro Aguirre Cerda special consul for immigration in Paris, was given responsibility for what he called \"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\": shipping more than 2,000 Spanish refugees, who had been housed by the French in squalid camps, to Chile on an old cargo ship, the Winnipeg.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nIn September 1939 World War II began. On 23 October 1940, Hitler and Franco met in Hendaye in France to discuss the possibility of Spain's entry on the side of the Axis. Franco's demands, including supplies of food and fuel, as well as Spanish control of Gibraltar and French North Africa, proved too much for Hitler. At the time Hitler did not want to risk damaging his relations with the new Vichy French government. (An oft-cited remark attributed to Hitler is that the German leader said that he would rather have some of his own teeth extracted than to have to personally deal further with Franco.) Franco had received important support from Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini during the Spanish Civil War, and he had signed the Anti-Comintern Pact. He described Spain as part of the Axis in official documents, while offering various kinds of support to Italy and Germany. He allowed Spanish soldiers to volunteer to fight in the German Army against the Soviet Union (the Blue Division), but forbade Spaniards to fight in the West against the democracies. Franco's common ground with Hitler was particularly weakened by Hitler's propagation of Nazi mysticism and his attempts to manipulate Christianity, which went against Franco's fervent commitment to defending Catholicism. Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands he knew Hitler would not accede to, in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that Franco, as the leader of a destroyed and bankrupt country in chaos following a brutal three-year civil war, simply had little to offer the Axis and that the Spanish armed forces were not ready for a major war. It has also been suggested that Franco decided not to join the war after the resources he requested from Hitler in October 1940 were not forthcoming.According to some scholars, after the Fall of France in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis stance (for example, German and Italian ships and U-boats were allowed to use Spanish naval facilities) before returning to a more neutral position in late 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against the Axis Powers, and Italy had changed sides. Franco was initially keen to join the war before the UK was defeated.In the winter of 1940\u201341 Franco toyed with the idea of a \"Latin Bloc\" formed by Spain, Portugal, Vichy France, the Vatican and Italy, without much consequence. Franco had cautiously decided to enter the war on the Axis side in June 1940, and to prepare his people for war, an anti-British and anti-French campaign was launched in the Spanish media that demanded French Morocco, Cameroon and Gibraltar. On 19 June 1940, Franco pressed along a message to Hitler saying he wanted to enter the war, but Hitler was annoyed at Franco's demand for the French colony of Cameroon, which had been German before World War I, and which Hitler was planning on taking back for Plan Z. Franco seriously considered blocking allied access to the Mediterranean Sea by invading British-held Gibraltar, but he abandoned the idea after learning that the plan would have likely failed due to Gibraltar being too heavily defended. In addition, declaring war on the UK and its allies would no doubt give them an  opportunity to capture both the Canary Islands and Spanish Morocco, as well as possibly launch an invasion of mainland Spain itself. Franco was aware that his air force would be defeated if going into action against the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy would be able to blockade Spain to prevent imports of crucial materials such as oil. Spain depended on oil imports from the United States, which were almost certain to be cut off if Spain formally joined the Axis. Franco and Serrano Su\u00f1er held a meeting with Mussolini and Ciano in Bordighera, Italy on 12 February 1941. Mussolini affected not to be interested in Franco's help due to the defeats his forces had suffered in North Africa and the Balkans, and he even told Franco that he wished he could find any way to leave the war. When the invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941, Franco's foreign minister Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er immediately suggested the formation of a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion. Volunteer Spanish troops (the Divisi\u00f3n Azul, or \"Blue Division\") fought on the Eastern Front under German command from 1941 to 1944. Some historians have argued that not all of the Blue Division were true volunteers and that Franco expended relatively small but significant resources to aid the Axis powers' battle against the Soviet Union.\nFranco was initially disliked by Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, who, during World War II, suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American declaration of war on Spain to overthrow Franco's regime. Hitler may not have really wanted Spain to join the war, as he needed neutral harbors to import materials from countries in Latin America and elsewhere. In addition Hitler felt Spain would be a burden as it would be dependent on Germany for help. By 1941 Vichy French forces were proving their effectiveness in North Africa, reducing the need for Spanish help, and Hitler was wary about opening up a new front on the western coast of Europe as he struggled to reinforce the Italians in Greece and Yugoslavia. Franco signed a revised Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. Spain continued to import war materials and trade wolfram with Germany until August 1944 when the Germans withdrew from the Spanish frontier.Spanish neutrality during World War II was appreciated and publicly acknowledged by leading Allied statesmen. In November 1942 President Roosevelt wrote to General Franco: \"...your nation and mine are friends in the best sense of the word.\" In May 1944 Winston Churchill stated in the House of Commons: \"in the dark days of the war the attitude of the Spanish Government in not giving our enemies passage through Spain was extremelly helpful to us...I must say that I shall always consider that a service was rendered...by Spain, not only to the United Kingdom  and to the British Empire and Commonwealth, but to the cause of the United Nations.\" Similar gratitude was also expressed by the Provisional French Government. Franco interposed no obstacle to Britain's construction of a big air base extending out of Gibraltar into Spanish territorial waters, and welcomed the Anglo-American landings in North Africa. Moreover, Spain did not intern any of the 1,200 American airmen who were forced to land in the country, but gave them shelter and helped them to leave.After the war, the Spanish government tried to destroy all evidence of its cooperation with the Axis. In 2010 documents were discovered showing that on 13 May 1941, Franco ordered his provincial governors to compile a list of Jews while he negotiated an alliance with the Axis powers. Franco supplied Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, architect of the Nazis' Final Solution, with a list of 6,000 Jews in Spain.On 14 June 1940, Spanish forces in Morocco occupied Tangier (a city under the rule of the League of Nations) and did not leave until the war's end in 1945.\nAfter the war, Franco allowed many former Nazis, such as Otto Skorzeny and L\u00e9on Degrelle, and other former fascists, to flee to Spain.\n\n\n=== Treatment of Jews ===\nFranco had a controversial association with Jews during the WWII period. In 2010, documents were discovered showing that on 13 May 1941, Franco ordered his provincial governors to compile a list of Jews while he negotiated an alliance with the Axis powers. Franco supplied Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, architect of the Nazis' Final Solution, with a list of 6,000 Jews in Spain.Contrarily, according to Anti-Semitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution (2005):\n\nThroughout the war, Franco rescued many Jews....Just how many Jews were saved by Franco's government during World War II is a matter of historical controversy. Franco has been credited with saving anywhere from approximately 30,000 to 60,000 Jews; most reliable estimates suggest 45,000 is a likely figure.Spain provided visas for thousands of French Jews to transit Spain en route to Portugal to escape the Nazis. Spanish diplomats protected about 4,000 Jews living in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. At least some 20,000 to 30,000 Jews were allowed to pass through Spain in the first half of the War. Jews who were not allowed to enter Spain, however, were sent to the Miranda de Ebro concentration camp or deported to France. In January 1943, after the German embassy in Spain told the Spanish government that it had two months to remove its Jewish citizens from Western Europe, Spain severely limited visas, and only 800 Jews were allowed to enter the country. After the war, Franco exaggerated his contribution to helping to save Jews to end Spain's isolation, to improve Spain's image in the world.After the war, Franco did not recognize Israeli statehood, and Israel expressed disinterest in establishing relations, although there were some informal economic ties between the countries in the later years of the regime.\nThe regime's propaganda claimed that there was an international conspiracy of Jews, Freemasons, and Communists against Spain. Under the Francoist regime, Jews, along with other non-Catholic communities, were heavily discriminated against \u2013 in 1945, the regime enacted the \"Spanish Bill of Rights\" (Fuero de los Espa\u00f1oles), which allowed the worship of non-Catholic religions; however, worship of non-Catholic religions was only allowed in private, no signs to indicate they were places of worship were allowed, and only Catholic public ceremonies were allowed, making it a huge regression in comparison to the Republican Constitution of 1931, which granted Jews rights they had not enjoyed in Spain since their expulsion in 1492. The situation improved with the 1967 Law on Religious Freedom, but discrimination still existed and non-Catholic groups were forced to register with the regime and to provide records of their members.On 16 December 1968, the regime formally revoked the 1492 Edict of Expulsion against Spain's Jewish population.Freedom of religion would be completely established in Spain in 1978, with the new Constitution of Spain, three years after Franco's death.\n\n\n== Spain under Franco ==\n\nFranco was recognized as the Spanish head of state by Great Britain, France and Argentina in February 1939. Already proclaimed General\u00edsimo of the Nationalists and Jefe del Estado (Head of State) in October 1936, he thereafter assumed the official title of \"Su Excelencia el Jefe de Estado\" (\"His Excellency the Head of State\"). He was also referred to in state and official documents as \"Caudillo de Espa\u00f1a\" (\"the Leader of Spain\"), and sometimes called \"el Caudillo de la \u00daltima Cruzada y de la Hispanidad\" (\"the Leader of the Last Crusade and of the Hispanic heritage\") and \"el Caudillo de la Guerra de Liberaci\u00f3n contra el Comunismo y sus C\u00f3mplices\" (\"the Leader of the War of Liberation Against Communism and Its Accomplices\").\nOn paper, Franco had more power than any Spanish leader before or since. For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees. According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power. He noted that while Hitler and Stalin maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, this was not the case in Spain in the early years after the war \u2013 a situation that nominally made Franco's regime \"the most purely arbitrary in the world\".This changed in 1942, when Franco convened a parliament known as the Cortes Espa\u00f1olas. It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the Movimiento Nacional (Carlists and Alfonsists). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a de facto regent for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a Captain General (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in El Pardo Palace. In addition he began walking under a canopy, and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins and postage stamps. He also added \"by the grace of God\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of technocrats, many of whom were linked with Opus Dei, who promoted economic modernisation.\n\nAlthough Franco adopted some trappings of fascism, he, and Spain under his rule, are generally not considered to be fascist; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, he was by nature conservative and traditional. Stanley Payne notes that very few scholars consider him to be a \"core fascist\". The few consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all authoritarianism, nationalism, Catholicism, anti-Freemasonry, and anti-communism.\nWith the end of World War II, Spain suffered from the consequences of its isolation from the international economy. Spain was excluded from the Marshall Plan, unlike other neutral countries in Europe. This situation ended in part when, in the light of Cold War tensions and of Spain's strategic location, the United States of America entered into a trade and military alliance with Franco. This historic alliance commenced with the visit of US President Dwight Eisenhower to Spain in 1953, which resulted in the Pact of Madrid. Spain was then admitted to the United Nations in 1955. American military facilities in Spain built since then include Naval Station Rota, Mor\u00f3n Air Base, and Torrej\u00f3n Air Base.\n\n\n=== Political repression ===\nThe first decade of Franco's rule following the end of the Civil War in 1939 saw continued repression and the killing of an undetermined number of political opponents. Estimation is difficult and controversial, but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000.\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the political spectrum, from communist and anarchist organisations to liberal democrats and Catalan or Basque separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist Sindicato Vertical. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) went underground. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the ETA armed group was created to wage a low-intensity war against Franco.\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. Bullfighting and flamenco were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered \"Spanish\" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, flamenco, an Andalusian tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the Sardana, the national dance of Catalonia, were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nFranco also used language politics in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of Castilian Spanish and suppressed other languages such as Catalan, Galician, and Basque. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\nThe Catholic Church was upheld as the established church of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. Divorce was forbidden, along with contraceptives, and abortion.Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of Guardia Civil, a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the Policia Armada, or the grises (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed Polic\u00eda Armada (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities. The enforcement by public authorities of traditional Catholic values was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes, Vagrancy Act) enacted by Aza\u00f1a. The remaining nomads of Spain (Gitanos and Mercheros like El Lute) were especially affected. Through this law, homosexuality and prostitution were made criminal offenses in 1954.\n\n\n=== Women in Francoist Spain ===\n\nFrancoism professed a devotion to the traditional role of a woman in society, that is being a loving daughter and sister to her parents and brothers, being a faithful wife to her husband, and residing with her family. Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s women could not open a bank account without having it co-signed by her father or husband. In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n\n=== The Spanish colonies and decolonisation ===\n\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonies throughout Franco's rule. During the Algerian War (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve French Algeria. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When French Morocco became independent in 1956, he surrendered Spanish Morocco to Morocco, retaining only a few enclaves (the Plazas de soberan\u00eda). The year after, Mohammed V invaded Spanish Sahara during the Ifni War (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the Green March, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\nIn 1968, under pressure from the United Nations, Spain granted Equatorial Guinea its independence, and the following year it ceded Ifni to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and closed its border with that territory in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of autarky, cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States and the IMF managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"Spanish miracle\".\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer SEAT, truck builder Pegaso, and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n\n== Succession ==\n\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency, but the simmering tensions between the Carlists and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the Carlist Wars, he offered the throne to the Habsburg Archduke Otto von Habsburg; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a Bourbon succession entirely, since the Habsburg family which had ruled the Habsburg Spain during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the War of the Spanish Succession. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a German ruling Spain and could never forget his Austrian identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n, who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the Carlist pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona, who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal. Nevertheless, the 56-year old Count didn't stand a chance against his charming son, whose youth allowed for an appropriate grooming by francoist tutors and was not tainted by a deserved reputation as a dissolute drink-loving aristocrat that clashed with the prevailing mores of the time.However, when Juan Carlos asked Franco if he could sit in on cabinet meetings, Franco would not permit him saying that \"you would do things differently.\" Due to the spread of democracy, excluding the Eastern Bloc, in Europe since World War II, Juan Carlos could or would not have been a dictator in the way Franco had been.By 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (Presidente del Gobierno), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the Movimiento would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The assassination of prime minister Luis Carrero Blanco in the 20 December 1973 bombing by ETA eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health problems, including a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a coma and was put on life support. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2013 on the same date as the death of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange, in 1936. Historian Ricardo de la Cierva claimed that he had been told around 6 pm on 19 November that Franco had already died. Juan Carlos was proclaimed King two days later.\nFranco's body was interred at Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, a colossal memorial built by the forced labour of political prisoners to honour the casualties of both sides of the Spanish Civil War. The site was designated by the interim government, assured by Prince Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro, as the burial place for Franco. According to his family, Franco did not want to be buried in the Valley, but in the Almudena Cathedral in Madrid. Nonetheless, the family agreed to the interim government's request to bury him in the Valley, and has stood by the decision. This made Franco the only person interred in the Valley who did not die during the civil war.\nNo Western European countries sent their leaders to attend Franco's funeral due to his tenure as dictator. The following guests took part in his funeral:\n\n Gaston Thorn, President of the United Nations General Assembly\n Jean Rey, President of the European Commission\n Juan Carlos I, King of Spain\n Rainier III, Sovereign Prince of Monaco\n Lord Shepherd, Leader of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom\n Augusto Pinochet, President of Chile\n Hugo Banzer, President of Bolivia\n Jorge Rafael Videla, future President of Argentina\n Nelson Rockefeller, Vice President of the United States\n Hussein, King of JordanIt was revealed that both Pinochet and Banzer revered Franco and modelled their leadership style on the Spanish leader. Former US President Richard Nixon called Franco \"a loyal friend and ally of the United States.\"\n\n\n== Exhumation ==\nOn 11 May 2017, the Congress of Deputies approved, by 198\u20131 with 140 abstentions, a motion driven by the Socialist Workers' Party ordering the Government to exhume Franco's remains.On 24 August 2018, the Government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez approved legal amendments to the Historical Memory Law stating that only those who died during the Civil War would be buried at the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, resulting in plans to exhume Franco's remains for reburial elsewhere. Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo Poyato stated that having Franco buried at the monument \"shows a lack of respect ... for the victims buried there\". The government gave Franco's family a 15-day deadline to decide Franco's final resting place, or else a \"dignified place\" will be chosen by the government.On 13 September 2018, the Congress of Deputies voted 176\u20132, with 165 abstentions, to approve the government's plan to remove Franco's body from the monument.Franco's family opposed the exhumation, and attempted to prevent it by making appeals to the Ombudsman's Office. The family expressed its wish that Franco's remains be reinterred with full military honors at the Almudena Cathedral in the centre of Madrid, the burial place he had requested before his death. The demand was rejected by the Spanish Government, which issued another 15-day deadline to choose another site. Because the family refused to choose another location, the Spanish Government ultimately chose to rebury Franco at the Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo, where his wife Carmen Polo and a number of Francoist officials, most notably prime ministers Luis Carrero Blanco and Carlos Arias Navarro, are buried. His body was to be exhumed from the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos on 10 June 2019, but the Supreme Court of Spain ruled that the exhumation would be delayed until the family had exhausted all possible appeals. On 24 September 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the exhumation could proceed, and the S\u00e1nchez government announced that it would move Franco's remains to the Mingorrubio cemetery as soon as possible. On 24 October 2019 his remains were moved to his wife's mausoleum which is located in the Mingorrubio Cemetery, and buried in a private ceremony. Though barred by the Spanish government from being draped in the Spanish flag, Francisco Franco's grandson, also named Francisco Franco, draped his coffin in the nationalist flag.According to a poll by the Spanish newspaper, El Mundo, 43% of Spanish people approved of the exhumation while 32.5% opposed it. The exhumation also seems to have been an opinion divided by party line with the Socialist party strongly in favor of its removal as well as the removal of his statue there. There seems to be no consensus on whether the statue should simply be moved or completely destroyed.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. The longevity of Franco's rule, his suppression of opposition, and the effective propaganda sustained through the years have made a detached evaluation difficult. For almost 40 years, Spaniards, and particularly children at school, were told that Divine Providence had sent Franco to save Spain from chaos, atheism, and poverty. Historian Stanley Payne described Franco as being the most significant figure to dominate Spain since Philip II, while Michael Seidman argued that Franco was the most successful counterrevolutionary leader of the 20th century.A highly controversial figure within Spain, Franco is seen as a divisive leader. Supporters credit him for keeping Spain neutral and uninvaded in World War II. They emphasize his strong anti-communist and nationalist views, economic policies, and opposition to socialism as major factors in Spain's post-war economic success and later international integration. Abroad he had support from Winston Churchill, Charles De Gaulle, Konrad Adenauer and many American Catholics, but was strongly opposed by the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.Conversely, critics on the left have denounced him as a tyrant responsible for thousands of deaths in years-long political repression, and have called him complicit in atrocities committed by Axis forces during World War II due to his support of Axis governments.\nWhen he died in 1975, the major parties of the left and the right agreed to follow the \"Pact of Forgetting\". To secure the transition to democracy, they agreed not to have investigations or prosecutions dealing with the civil war or Franco. The agreement effectively lapsed after 2000, the year the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory was founded and the public debate started. In 2006, a poll indicated that almost two-thirds of Spaniards favored a \"fresh investigation into the war\".The Oxford Living Dictionary uses Franco's regime as an example of fascism. However, most historians agree that although Franco and Spain under his rule adopted some trappings of fascism they are generally not considered to be fascist, at most describing the early totalitarian phase of his rule as a \"fascistized dictatorship\", or \"semi-fascist regime\".Franco served as a role model for several anti-communist dictators in South America. Augusto Pinochet is known to have admired Franco. Similarly, as recently as 2006, Franco supporters in Spain have honored Pinochet.In 2006, the BBC reported that Maciej Giertych, an MEP of the clerical-nationalist League of Polish Families, had expressed admiration for Franco, stating that the Spanish leader \"guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe\".\n\nSpaniards who suffered under Franco's rule have sought to remove memorials of his regime. Most government buildings and streets that were named after Franco during his rule have been reverted to their original names. Owing to Franco's human-rights record, the Spanish government in 2007 banned all official public references to the Franco regime and began the removal of all statues, street names and memorials associated with the regime, with the last statue reportedly being removed in 2008 in the city of Santander. Churches that retain plaques commemorating Franco and the victims of his Republican opponents may lose state aid. Since 1978, the national anthem of Spain, the Marcha Real, does not include lyrics introduced by Franco. Attempts to give the national anthem new lyrics have failed due to lack of consensus.\nIn March 2006, the Permanent Commission of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe unanimously adopted a resolution \"firmly\" condemning the \"multiple and serious violations\" of human rights committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975. The resolution was at the initiative of Leo Brincat and of the historian Luis Mar\u00eda de Puig, and was the first international official condemnation of the repression enacted by Franco's regime. The resolution also urged that historians (professional and amateur) be given access to the various archives of the Francoist regime, including those of the private Francisco Franco National Foundation (FNFF) which, along with other Francoist archives, remain inaccessible to the public as of 2006. The FNFF received various archives from the El Pardo Palace, and is alleged to have sold some of them to private individuals. Furthermore, the resolution urged the Spanish authorities to set up an underground exhibit in the Valle de los Caidos monument to explain the \"terrible\" conditions in which it was built. Finally, it proposed the construction of monuments to commemorate Franco's victims in Madrid and other important cities.In Spain, a commission to \"repair the dignity\" and \"restore the memory\" of the \"victims of Francoism\" (Comisi\u00f3n para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las v\u00edctimas del franquismo) was approved in 2004, and is directed by the social-democratic deputy Prime Minister Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega.\n\nRecently the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARHM) initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, which has been supported since the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's (PSOE) victory during the 2004 elections by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's government. A Ley de la memoria hist\u00f3rica de Espa\u00f1a (Law on the Historical Memory of Spain) was approved on 28 July 2006, by the Council of Ministers, but it took until 31 October 2007, for the Congress of Deputies to approve an amended version as \"The Bill to recognise and extend rights and to establish measures in favour of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Civil War and the Dictatorship\" (in common parlance still known as Law of Historical Memory). The Senate approved the bill on 10 December 2007.Official endeavors to preserve the historical memory of the Franco regime include exhibitions like the one the Museu d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya (Museum of Catalan History) organised around the prison experience.The accumulated wealth of Franco's family (including much real estate inherited from Franco, such as the Pazo de Meir\u00e1s, the Canto del Pico in Torrelodones and the Casa Cornide in A Coru\u00f1a), and its provenance, have also become matters of public discussion. Estimates of the family's wealth have ranged from 350 million to 600 million euros. While Franco was dying, the Francoist Cortes voted a large public pension for his wife Carmen Polo, which the later democratic governments kept paying. At the time of her death in 1988, Carmen Polo was receiving as a pension more than 12.5 million pesetas (four million more than the salary of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, then head of the government).\n\n\n== In popular media ==\n\n\n=== Cinema and television ===\n\n\n=== Music ===\nFrench singer-songwriter and anarchist L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9 wrote \"Franco la muerte\", a song he recorded for his 1964 album Ferr\u00e9 64. In this highly confrontational song, he directly shouts at the dictator and lavishes him with contempt. Ferr\u00e9 refused to sing in Spain until Franco was dead.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nFranco is a character in CJ Sansom's book Winter in Madrid\n...Y al tercer a\u00f1o resucit\u00f3 (...And On the Third Year He Rose Again) (1980) describes what would happen if Franco rose from the dead.\nFranco is featured in the novel Triage (1998) by Scott Anderson.\nFranco is the centrepiece of the satirical work El general Franquisimo o La muerte civil de un militar moribundo by Andalusian political cartoonist and journalist Andr\u00e9s V\u00e1zquez de Sola.\nFranco features in several novels by Caroline Angus Baker, including Vengeance in the Valencian Water, visiting the aftermath of the 1957 Valencia floods, and Death in the Valencian Dust, about the final executions handed down before his death in 1975.\nDr Halliday Sutherland was invited to visit Spain for 12 weeks in 1946 as a guest of the Spanish government. He agreed on condition that he would be free to go where he liked and to talk to anyone whom he chose to meet. He wrote about his experiences in \"Spanish Journey\" (1948).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLanguage politics in Francoist Spain\nList of dictators in modern times\nSymbols of Francoism\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSaz Campos, Ismael (2004).

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

          "My original purpose for visiting La Seo was to see its tapestry collection. However, I was most impressed with the unique blend of architectural styles that creates this 700 year-old church (Romanesque, Gothic, Mudejar, Renaissance, Baroque). The tall bell tower is most",
          "Catedral de San Salvador or Cathedral of Zaragoza on Plaza de la Seo. Exterior has Moorish and Romanesque architecture with a Neoclassical fa\u00e7ade. Inside, the choir is Gothic & Capilla del Santo Cristo of Renaissance architecture. Its Tapestry Museum has 63 Flemish tapestries",
          "This was my favourite place in Zaragoza. The Cathedral is beautiful. There is plenty of information in English, and choral background music which makes it a very quiet and relaxing place to spend time in.",
          "This basilica is also very impressive. Definitely visit both while you are here. The paintings and tapestries tell the story of the past and the architecture inside is spectacular. We weren\u2019t going to go into this one but we\u2019re glad we did and wished we had allowed more time to",
          "Although the Basilica is only a few metres away in the same main square and is far more opulent this cathedral is still stunning. It reflects the art , history and faith of Aragon and was built initially in 12th century. The high Alterpiece is quite magnificent shining with gold",
          "entrance fee is 4 euro. huge cathedral with really good paintings. there are English brochures that explains technical details and painters and years for paintings.",
          "Not much to add to previous reviews. It really is an astonishing place and much more interesting than Pilar. Excellent info pamphlet and backlit screens, albeit in Spanish, giving further details of each of the chapels, high altar etc. Even if you can't read Spanish you will",
          "The exterior is very understated compared to the interior! Filled with many chapels, two major mass areas and a forum in the center, this was the main church over the years in Zaragoza. It is worth the time and $4.",
          "Lovely calming visit. The church is lovely and not as daunting as El Pilar. The Tapestry museum upstairs was an eye opener. Huge pieces many hundreds of years old. Such a surprise.",
          "Compared with its neighboring and imposing Basilica of the Pillar, the Cathedral doesn\u00b4t impress from the outside. Once inside, you\u00b4ll be astonished with its collection or remarkable chancels, all around the temple\u00b4s periphery and also around the choir. And you can\u00b4t leave the",
          "Not my favourite style of church interior but worth the \u20ac4 for the tapestry museum. They are in excellent condition and the amount of detail is fascinating.",
          "From the outside it shows already different styles, inside there is a collection of diverse smaller chapels, impressive retable but no pictures allowed.",
          "As the locals use to say: Two Cathedrals! This also deserves a visit. Composite, huge, nice view of chapels and a marvelous set of art and historical items to know.",
          "There are so many strikingly beautiful churches in Zaragoza and in Spain and this is one of them. Very impressive but all standards. And, do not miss the lovely tapestry museum hidden in the back of the church.",
          "Along with the Pilar Basilica this is another gargantuan church on the giant plaza. It is built on the site of the Roman Forum and was formerly a mosque. It has undergone a great deal of renovations so is built to impress and humble. We were only part way through our visit when",
          "This is seriously amazing, it's huge and full of small side chapels which have explanations though only in Spanish but at least that tells you which saint the chapel is dedicated to. The art work is amazing from floors to ceilings. We were more than an hour there just looking",
          "It came at surprise that we had to pay to enter into a church so we decided to visit from the outside",
          "2nd in terms of size and importance but the oldest in Saragossa. Amazing as well . So must to be seen here .",
          "This had a sense that the Holy Spirit was there and people were sincerely worshipping. There was more respect than the Basilica where people were taking photos right in front of those praying. Much better visit.",

          "It is one of the best examples of the gothic style on the inside really spectacular and well taken care of the outside actually is even more interesting since it shows the moorish beginning th baroque style of portal and a fantastic brick tower",
          "There are thousands of Cathedral in Europe, each with their own character. La Seo (just adjacent to the well known Basilica del Pilar) was an unwittingly quite by accident find. But what a hidden gem! I have seen numerous churches, but was awe struck by the treasure trove",
          "I've never seen anything like this. It's a huge from the inside. The amount of art is amazing, those chapels were really beautiful. What makes it so beautiful is the diversity of the chapels. I can say that visiting this building was my favorite experience during my holiday at",
          "This cathedral, popularly known as \u201cLa Seo\u201d is located in Plaza de La Seo, just down the block from the Basilica del Pilar. The interior, while more somber and dark than the Basilica, contains beautiful chapels, wood carvings, and a renowned High Altar. The site was once a Roman",
          "It was so beautiful and good condition. But quite dark to see and there is place still working on it. I can not say anything for the beauty of this church, but I think the price is quite too much.",
          "The cathedral is near the other and it's huge.The entrance is 4 euros and it's forbidden to take pictures. Inside there are diffrent sections with different styles between the Romanic,Arabic and Baroque. Incredible the altar in silver and gold and the \"retablo\" wich is all",
          "We visited in a beautiful October day as we were passing through on our way to Valencia. The cathedral is stunning and perfectly maintained. The many side chapels are glorious - unusual to an Anglican eye with so many saints being celebrated with amazing carvings, works of art",
          "Not only is the tower impressive and ful of details, the surrounding area is ful of great buildings.",

          "I\u2019m sorry, but I have a problem with churches charging admission. I have a bigger problem with them charging admission and then prohibiting photos. This church is beautiful, hands down, and I\u2019ve been all over Europe. But seriously...if you are going to charge me entry, back off",
          "Incredibly atmospheric and beautiful (totally insufficient word for the majesty of this place!) cathedral. The sculptures are reasonably well explained in the welcome leaflet - please don't forget to look up at the awe-inspiring ceilings and domes. Absolutely DO NOT leave",
          "If the Pilar Basilica wasn\u2019t here this would have scored 5. Absolutely superb and I feel guilty to only give 4 star rating.",
          "Unlike the Pilar, La Seo is not free, but don't be scared off. You are paying in part for the tapestry museum off the far back corner, and I think a lot of people who go in simply don't realize it's even there. Also like the Pilar, La Seo doesn't allow photography, even",
          "First off, we had visited the Church of the Pilar nearby, which was free entrance. The other couple, my wife and I made our way over to the Seo, which sits on one of the short ends of the HUGE plaza. Admittedly, we were somewhat turned off by the 4 euro entrance fee, probably",
          "The smallest of the two basilicas in town but really beautiful, looks more like a museum. It was on repairs with limited access but totally worth it.",
          "There are a lot of churches in Zaragoza, and most of them are free, whereas this charges, but it is worth it! It is like 20 churches in one as there are so many side chapels, each with its own unique quality, most of them of stunning beauty, and the main altar backdrop is",
          "My husband, son, and I went there today. We like historical sites, and we enjoyed walking around this church. If you enjoy tapestries, be sure to find the tapestry museum. It doesn\u2019t cost any extra, but it\u2019s easy to miss if you aren\u2019t paying attention. Plan to spend at least an",
          "One of the most beautiful and interesting churches we have visited. Stunning architecture and unusual artistic features make this a very special place.",

          "La Seo is a huge gothic cathedral with incredibly elaborate chapels in the side aisles as well as a central choir lined with little chapels. I guess it is interesting from an artistic point of view, but I found it emotionally cold, especially in comparison to the Basilica del",
          "Currently restoring the exterior but check out the beautiful ceramic tiled side wall ( left exterior wall when facing front facade). The interior is also full of interesting art and do not miss the exquisite tapestry rooms upstairs. The location of the church is near at the far",
          "Even if you just look at the outside you will be amazed at the mosaic of geometrical architecture on the stone - this used to be a mosque and was turned into a church",
          "The church is arguably more impressive than the basilica however both have a lot of charm. The architecture and decor have been well documented for you to read about once inside. Truly jaw dropping but I respected the no photography policy. The tapestry museum is fascinating",
          "The old cathedral, known as La Seo stands at the far end of plaza del pilar. The gleaming exterior is essentially gothic-mudejar. The wall on a side is with elaborate geometric patterns. Make it really stunning. Must see it.",
          "Fantastic bell tower and huge cathedral, built into the medieval mosque. Very nice surroundings and area. However entrance is locked as its on some kind of reconstruction",
          "Exquisite azure mosaic design on the cathedral exterior. Sadly I did not go inside as the cathedral closes for much of the day. Check opening times.",
          "Absolutely stunning - one of the most beautiful reilgeous buildings I have ever seen. Only drawback - no photography.",
          "Inside, this cathedral is the most beautiful and impressive buidling in Zaragoza, more so than the Basilica del Pilar. Exquisite vaulted ceilings in high-Gothic style, ornate chapels, spectacular altar pieces The tapestry museum. Unfortunately the whole thing closes in the",
          "I had friends waiting for me, but once I got upstairs to the tapestry museum I texted them to tell them not to wait: there was no way I could NOT take a good look once there, as the tapestries were stunning: 15th-century Flemish masterworks that are well worth a visit.",
          "You have to pay entrance to this church. But it is worth the money. It is Absolutely beautiful inside. You are not allowed to take pictures so you have to visit it. But if you are in Zaragoza it is a must. I found La Seo more awesome than El Pilar.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful Cathedral I've seen in my life. Check with TI open hours, the Cathedral is not open all day. Absolutely no photos inside. The Cathedral located in center of town at Plaza de la Seo and and it can be seen from another not less famous central",
          "Just as beautiful as Pilar, if not more! The design inside and out is breath taking. Worth combining with a visit to Plaza Pilar.",
          "Probably the Catedral on Pilar in Zaragoza is the most famous one so after visiting it we could not imagine that once we enter the La Seo del Salvador cathedral it will be difficult for us to say which one is more interesting. Just stunning... marvellous architectural gem.",
          "We were looking forward to visiting La Seo and it was supposed to be open till 2 p.m. We got to the entrance at 13.30 and were not allowed in. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to go back",
          "Don't be fooled by the outside of this church, inside s absolutely stunning. Gothic arches and baroque decoration make this a must see when in Zaragoza. Every chapel is spectacular with no shortage of decoration. The entry fee is a pittance, however photos are not permitted",
          "Significantly reduced from its original size, La Seo is nevertheless an artistic jewel. The exterior of the building displays beautiful Moorish tile work, whereas the in interior shows perfect baroque decoration in a series of chapels. Unesco heritage site - entrance fee",
          "From a distance, the beauty of this tower stands out, no pun intended. Walking closer one can begin to appreciate the intricate beauty, the interesting architecture and gracious design. Enjoy!",
          "I'm not into religion so this visit was strictly because I admire baroque art and architecture. I wasn't disappointed. In fact it was almost overwhelming. The cathedral looks small from the outside and walking into the main cathedral takes your breath away. As an added",
          "Another stunning Zaragoza building. Entry fee is modest (a few euros) and well worth it. You can spend a good two hours here and at the Tapestry Museum upstairs.",
          "This is a beautiful church built on what had been a Moorish mosque. The Moorish features are still evident. The tapestry museum in the rear deserves a few minutes. Photos are not allowed inside but you are given a guide with some very nice photos.",
          "Not to be missed. Overshadowed in the city by the basilica, but my partner and I much preferred this. Wonderful atmosphere and good amount of information provided. One of the best cathedrals I\u2019ve visited!",
          "Awesome cathedral, clearly meant to awe and it does. Whatever your thoughts on Church/religion you should visit for the achitecture alone. Includes a fascinating Tapestry Museum which is well worth a visit in itself. Easy to find - only a few yards from the Plaza del Pilar",
          "This is probably the first cathedral I have visited where I couldn't find one candle. Some churches have electric candles, which is not the same. I refuse to light one of those, it's just not got the feeling. Otherwise it is a very nice cathedral.",
          "For me, the best cathedral to visit in Zaragoza. Once restored, the light that enters in the temple and the mix of cultures along it, both inside and outside deserve it.",
          "Although not as large and dramatic as the Basilica it is worth visiting. As seniors we got a reduced entrance fee and also provided leaflet in English which helped alot. We visited the tapestry exhibition which was well worth the time even though there is no info in English",
          "I have seen a lot of cathedrals and this is one of the most interesting/beautiful. I would really recommend seeing this one.",
          "The \u201cCatedral Del Salvador\u201d or \u201cCathedral of the Saviour\u201d nick named also as the \u201cLa Seo\u201d, is a \u201cRoman Catholic Cathedral, who is part of the \u201cWorld Heritage Site Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon. The Cathedral is located on the \u201cPlaza de la Seo\u201d but commonly known as the \u201cLa Seo\u201d",
          "We had to pay to enter the cathedral and we were given a guide leaflet, available in several languages. Inside there are 19 chapels, each with a descriptive pillar telling about it in English and Spanish. There was an organ recital while were there, which was a bonus. The",
          "This is a paid for attraction and as a result it's quieter. You get a free English guide so you really can understand the artwork. It's quiet and reflective and well worth a visit when in Zaragoza.",
          "Small entrance charge but you get multilingual (returnable) guide to provide information about all the chapels and the central choir area - an interesting phenomenon that the choirs of these Spanish cathedralls are enclosed - not seen that before. You can spend about 1/2 hour",
          "Don't miss this gem of Zaragoza but mind they close at least 30 minutes before the service. The official opening hours are not respected, unfortunately.",
          "La Seo del Salvador is the real Cathedral of the city (not the Basilica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar) and it is located in Pilar Square, near the Basilica, in the old town. However the outside facade seems not so impressive as Basilica, the inner part, for me, is very beautiful.",
          "This was the highlight of my trip to the city. A feast for the senses - you must see the tapestries as well as the cathedral.",
          "Very large cathedral of Zaragoza, La Seo. Impressive interior. Built in XVII century. Gothic design.",
          "The La Seo Cathedral is located near the end of the Pilar Plaza on the Plaza de la Seo. The cathedral is a mixture of styles, including Romanesque (exterior and apse), Baroque (tower and gate), Neo-classical (main door), Mud\u00e9jar (interior roof and exterior wall) and Gothic",
          "Maybe we should have visited the Goya Museum after this cathedral, because we found the cathedral to be the most depressingly opulent one we have seen (we've seen many in 20+ years of traveling in northern and western Europe). La Seu has two dozen chapels filled with gold",
          "Seo is the word for 'cathedral', one of the four feminine Spanish words ending in -o which are not an abbreviation. Pay attention and do not miss the old mudejar (Moorish) wall and the older part of the Seo, outside. The restauration of the inside is perfect and everything is",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral. The tapestry collection is stunning. Visitors may wish to compare it to the nearby Basilica Del Pilar, which is far more crowded..",
          "We have spent around an hour in this place. We really like interior design of it. Every part of the building was very well preserved.",
          "I agree with the reviewer who said that it was better than the Basilica del Pilar. A beautiful space, with numerous beautifully decorated side chapels and a sense wonder. Highly recommended.",
          "Stunning architecture and paintings- a real gem. Well worth every cent of the 4 euros admission charge",
          "I actually found this more interesting that the nearby Pilar basilica. 4 euro entry. I dont agree they should charge people to visit a church, but this includes the tapestry museum so I guess thats how they get away with it. The English leaflet was very informative with map of",
          "While the Pilar is definitely beautiful, I would argue that the Seo is the most breathtaking of the two famous cathedrals. The artwork is beautiful, and the atmosphere is quiet and peaceful. There are many display signs in Spanish and English throughout the building. The",
          "We had just visited the large magnificent looking El Pillar the day before and saw this sad building all covered in scaffolding, standing at the side. Knowing its history of crowning kings in the past, we felt motivated to attend Easter service there. And was it such a blessing",
          "Gothic style stunning inside and out; build in the 1300s and there is so much to see inside. Must visit in Zara...",
          "Of the two big churches in Plaza del Pilar, I would suggest that Seo cathedral is the more satisfactory on the inside. As I mention in my review of the Basilica del Pilar, that heavy Spanish baroquery needs some austerity to set it off, and the light stone interior - in a kind",
          "There was a small cost for entrance but it was well worth it. There are many different chapels within the cathedral and the leaflet you receive on entry gives details of each in a number of languages including English. The sheer beauty is amazing and there are lots of excellent",
          "It wasn't what I expected and I thought the entrance fee did not merit an entrance as the view inside from the outside wasn't crash hot.",
          "This cathedral is at one end of the Plaza, the same Plaza where the Basilica. This cathedral is older than the Basilica. There are older parts and newer parts. This cathedral is very ornate inside with beautiful art and carvings and statues and domes. This is why it is a must",
          "No photography is allowed either here or La Pillar which is a great shame because it is spectacularly beautiful. There were also works by Goya and the most amazing sculpture on display. Very disappointing service from the closest Tourist Office who did not have the linguistic",

          "The architecture is amazing. The small bricks used are architecture is similar to the islamic/Persian mosque design. But it has its own character. dont miss it.",
          "Born and raised in the neighborhood, the cathedral happened to be my parish. I used to go to mass with my mother. I always looked with curiosity at the scenes depicted in the walls around the choir. It continues the same, spectacular. The feelings, art, long-standing values,",
          "Do not miss this church when in Zaragoza. The ticket costs 4 euros (and 3 for students)...well worth it. Watch out for opening times...when we visited...the closed at lunch time and reopened at 4pm! For a freezing cold winter day...that is a lot of waiting! When we walked",
          "A jewel, particularly because of Mudejar architecture in some parts of the inside and a whole wall outside. The whole cathedral is also very nice to visit, with a nice hangings museum. Please check and double check timetable since they are quite restrictive and you may finish",
          "This is a really spectacular cathedral with very beautiful chapels and is well worth the admission price. Unfortunately photos are not permitted. Many different architectural styles in this cathedral which was built on the site of of the old Roman forum. Many centuries later",
          "You are able to take an audio tour of this church that provides you with a lot of interesting information. There is also a mini-museum at the rear that was included in the tour.",

          "It is located in the Plaza Del Pilar and has an interesting number of architectural styles to it. Originally, it was the site of an Islamic mosque......before which was a Roman site. All of this is reflective of the different conquerors of Zaragoza's history.",
          "Tjhis cathedral is near the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar.Admission 5 euros ??? (not sure). The exterior of this cathedral looks not so attractive, but inside really amazing and better than Basilica. Must see in Zarogosa. Day trip from Madrid by high speed train (1 hour",

          "The most beautiful cathedral, really worth a look. When wondering around from one chapel to another within the cathedral, the detail in each individual chapel is magnificent, and the cost to maintain would be astronomical. You can see the Muslim iinfluence in a lot of the",
          "We didn't go inside, but enjoyed some peace and quiet in the plaza. The left side wall of the church is absolutely stunning. When we went on a Saturday there was an event on - maybe a wedding, and so you couldn't enter in the morning.",
          "Not all that familiar with the insides of such a place but this one took my breath away. The grandeur, the nooks, the paintings, the floor, the roof. Needless to say it is impressive. No pictures allowed inside so see it for yourself. The little paintings done by Goya that",
          "Adjacent to the Basilica and as stunning, the history, culture and grandeur make this a must see. I ciuld not believe how impressive both the Cathedral and the Basilica were, don't miss them",
          "normally at Zaragoza everybody visits the Basilica of El Pilar, only 100 mts from there you can admire a jewel of mixture of cultures, the old mosque and now cathedral of La Seo. Outside can enjoy still the muslim art while inside , out of the noise of other monuments, can enjoy",
          "Wonderful cathedral, plenty of small chapels and magnificent organ. Superb sculptures to see and appreciate. After this visit the tapestry museum by St.Bartholomews Door.",
          "Inside and out, the Seo is a lovely building, with a fascinating mixture of architectural styles and artistic decorations. The high altar, the choir, and the small tower that lets light in to the altar area are not to be missed. There is also a tapestry museum covered in the",
          "Very impressive place to visit. We found it more impressive than the basillica because of the ornate ceiling and it felt calmer and more relaxed. It costs a few euros to enter but once inside there is no time limit. Marvel at how big the place is. We worked out that our house",
          "Normally I can leave Baroque-style structures alone, but this one is quite extraordinary. A twelfth-century frame on which has been stretched parts from the 15th century (main altar), the 16th, the 17th (many of the side chapels), somehow it all comes together. Modern lighting",
          "One of the most spectacular and awe inspiring churches I have ever seen. Beautiful sacred music been played in the background. Orgeous architecture.",
          "From the outside the building appears rather plain compared to its near neighbour, the Basilica. But on entering it is a stunning site that awaits you. The shear size is amazing, together with the carvings and decorations. It really is a spectacle and puts the interior of the",
          "A treasure alongside the Pilar Cathedral. There is background of sacred music. Have a nice tapestry museum.",
          "If you don't mind paying to visit a church, this visit is truly imperative The \"parroquieta\" -accessible through the door to the left of the main one when open- it is free for worship purpose. In it, the coffered ceiling and the Fernandez de Luna's sarcophagus are extraordinary",

          "Beautiful cathedral with magnificent tapestry museum attached. This just one of attractions in Zaragoza - all excellent. Lovely walkable city.",
          "We walked into La Seo del Salvador and it's amazing. However, I have personally been to numerous similar architectures and didn't find this much of a difference than others. FREE to go in so drop by to have a look.",
          "I went around this Cathedral after visiting the basilica de nuestra senora del pillar. It is a mix of mudejar, baroque and gothic styles. I was baffled by the wonderful and delicate workmanship of the mudejars in the middle ages. I didnot have the time to enter though. You must",
          "If you like the cathedral in Toledo, maybe you will also adore this beautiful cathedral- La Seo de San Salvador. The entrance fee is 4\u20ac, it's a pity they do not allow taking photo inside! But the benefit is that you will give your whole concentration to observe every corner of",
          "This cathedral is a mix of renaissance and gothic architecture. To British eyes it is less attractive because the choir is in the centre and this obscures the long views of the nave that are typical of gothic cathedrals. There is an interesting tapestry museum attached to the",
          "The Seo Cathedral is a not very known wonder in Spain. The mixture of mudejar, gothic and barroc makes it unique. The tapestries included in the museum with the entrance ticket are amazing. Pity they don't allow pictures inside. They should offer audioguides as they are doing in",
          "La Seo was the best we have ever been in - anywhere - so much to see (English leaflet - which is NOT available everywhere). Beautiful inside which is not the impression you necessarily get from the outside - DO NOT miss this. Tapestry Museum within is also very impressive.",
          "The cathedral is the equal of Seville and Toledo, an over-the-top place of gold leaf, wood and marble carving, paintings and frescoes, and anything else that one can add. Every view and angle shows something spectacular.",

          "You are charged to go into the cathedral, but it is impressive inside and in my view more interesting than the El Pilar. There is a stunning alabaster altarpiece with a reliquary to St Valorie. And at the other end an extraordinary chased gold altar canopy. But the best part is",
          "pretty inside. they have a three floor museum inside , goes right to the top from where there is a good view of the plaza del pillar",

          "La Seo is a very interesting cathedral - and definitely worth a visit. The decor is extremely busy inside ... so much so that it feels overwhelming. Similar to it's neighbor, Our Lady of the Pillar, it has multiple chapels, but it feels like each one is competing with the next.",
          "This museum was really well lit and organized. incredible workmanship. For anyone who is interested in the needle arts...this was great.",
          "Seeing La Seo from El Pilar, I wasn't really impressed and I wondered why it was so well rated...then I went to the side! What a spectacular side facade, well worth seeing!",
          "Though not as stunning as its neighbour, the Basilica, this ancient church displays the Muslim roots in Spain very well.",
          "We could appreciate the 20 year recent renovation as this Cathedral sparkles from the patterned floor to rib vaulted ceiling, throughout a score of side chapels, to the altar and choir. Upstairs, three rooms feature over 30 15th to 16th C Flemish tapestries, all in superb",
          "The cathedral itself is very impressive, however every chapel inside is separate peace of art. In addition there is the tapestry collection.",
          "The old cathedral in Zaragoza is an amazing place to visit, richly decorated, exquisite altars, definitely a must have",
          "Quite a sumptuous church - beautiful sculptures, paintings - the artwork is splendid. A tapestry museum upstairs with an interesting collection of tapestries that we found quite fascinating from the 15 and 16th centuries.",
          "This impressive cathedral is also the home to an amazing tapestry museum. It is a UNESCO heritage listed site and when you visit you can understand why. It is a very tranquil place to visit, a beautiful example of Gothic Mudejar architecture, do not rush your visit, soak in the",
          "UNESCO world heritage site that impresses as a magnificent cathedral - it also houses an incredible tapestry museum that is outstanding.",
          "This place are so wonderful, lot of story was in this place, lot of restaurants surrounded.. Clean area and nice for selfish or whatever you want take foto",
          "Actually a nice interesting cathedral which has many interesting sculptures around the chapels, the retabel is nice as well but not as elaborate as the side chapels. The downside you have to pay 4 EUR to get inside and - as usual for catholic churches where you need to pay to",
          "The day we visited the Basilica del Pilar, this cathedral was not open, so we came back the next day. We went around the building to admire to be able to see it in its entirety. The best view, however, is from the Plaza del Pilar. Make sure to check the opening times, so you",
          "You have to listen to the wonderful bells - even better whilst sitting in the sunshine with a lovely glass of wine.",
          "This is right in the heart of the city just to the left to Pilar if you are facing the cathedral. A very beautiful place with a rich history and very interesting architecture which basically tells the story of the city through the ages and the various conquerors. Worth a stop,",
          "The cathedral was renovated a few years ago. It has magnificently high arches and stunning detail. It doesn't have the buzz of the Basilica del Pilar, but rather has the quite awe that you expect from a cathedral. We went early and our little boy made a bit of noise, but the",
          "It has been a really nice place where having a walk, particularly in sunny days. You can breath the Spain air.",
          "A ticket is 4 euros but it's definitely worth it. You will be provided with a guide explaining the history of each area inside the cathedral. It is peaceful and a beautiful example of Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar architecture. Take your time to admire the intricately decorated interior.",
          "The La Seo del Salvador is a UNESCO heritage listed site - and deservedly so. Each alcove is elaborate and rich in art. The provided guide sheet provides information for each area. Tranquil and quiet, this is a recommended visit.",
          "This city church is not so big as Plaza de Pilla or other church but the architecture is still beautiful and worth to visit.",
          "Really beautiful inside with chapels and altars very intricately decorated. Unfortunately, there are no English explanations or guides for the chapels. Also a 4 Euro entry fee.",
          "Very interesting place with an gorgeus architecure that combines three important styles. Take your time here because realy worth seeing.",
          "Interest building tower to yr eyes is not upright, photo taken look normal. Just beside to roman walls",
          "The La Seo (to \"see) is Zaragosa's second cathedral. Separated by only a short distance - equivalent to maybe 2 to 3 blocks - from the Basilica del Pilar, there was a long-standing rivalry between the two in the past. For several centuries, all Aragonese kings were crowned",
          "This cathedral is close to the basilica of Zaragoza and makes for an excellent double visit.. Both are fine examples of old religious buildings but for me the cathedral made for a better visit. The guide is available in English as part of the entry fee.",
          "A short walk from the Basilica, this is another beautiful building, inside and out. The interior is spectacular and full of history.",
          "La Seo is a beautiful building in the Basilica square. The structure features mudejar architecture and wonderful ceramic design on the north wall. The church contains a Tapestry museum at modest additional cost.",
          "This beautiful cathedral is built over the remains of Zaragoza's original Roman forum as well as a mosque built later. It demonstrates multiple architectural styles and has excellent Gothic design elements. The interior is divided into multiple small chapels with the relics of",
          "The entrance fee includes a visit to the tapestry museum. The latest is not my cup of tea but when you think about the amount of work that took it so many years ago, it's pretty impressive. The inside of the church is very beautiful especially one part that was completely",
          "To my amazement, the La Seo is the best Cathedral in Zaragoza and not the Pilar Cathedral. La Seo charge 4 euros for entrance, but it is worth it.It is beautifully maintained and the stained windows and everything including the magnificient Dome is outstanding . It also has some",
          "A very beautiful cathedral at the end of the plaza down the street from El Pilar Cathedral. There are restaurants righ near both churches",
          "Now I am not a religious person but have visited many cathedrals in Spain and have got to say this visit was mindblowing reflecting the faith, the history and the art of Aragon. Declared World Heritage in 2001 you can see why the minute you enter the gothic style cathedral and",
          "I personally enjoyed the visit to the Seo more than the visit to the Basilica. The space, paintings, fresco's and statues spoke more to my imagination than the visit to the Basilica.",
          "Very nice church, with impressive architecture, right next to Basilica del Pilar.I really liked the tapestry museum.",
          "It is so full of details tha in my opinion this temple is even more beatifull that El Pilar. It is a MUST DO visit in Zaragoza.",
          "Truly worth the entrance fee to see a stunning architectural masterpiece, with fantastic ceilings and chapels.",
          "This is a very pretty church but it is located in the same square as the Basilica del Pilar. If you visit this one first, you will be impressed but it is nothing compared to the Basilica del Pilar. It has a wonderful tapestry museum which is worth the modest fee.",
          "Amazing structure and art!! Islamc, Christian and Jewish influence is seen in the art and architecture inside and out.",
          "La Seo del Salvador was the first christian church to be built in Zaragoza, previously on this site was the Roman forum of the old city of Caesaraugusta. The Apse, parish and dome of La Seo del Salvador are included on the World Heritage List for its Mud\u00e9jar Architecture. This",
          "I thoroughly loved the visit to this gorgeous church. There were clear explanations of each chapel, there was renaissance music playing, there is a museum of tapestry, the architecture is absolutely beautiful. I loved the Moorish wall on the outside of the church.",
          "We had not read that much about La Seo and were surprised and greatly impressed by its beauty, decor and preservation. It has a fantastic altar, beautiful choir and a number of very interesting and beautiful small chapels along the walls. A beautiful, jewel of a cathedral, well",
          "Moorish, romanesque & baroque all combined in this cathedral, which is a haven of peace & tranquility. There is a small fee to pay, but it is worth the 3 or 4 Euro.",
          "Worth a visit for the beautiful baroque architecture inside. Information in Spanish and English. Awesome and spacious, lots to look at. Baroque and Moorish exterior.",
          "The view from the inside is extraordinary and you would love this place Seeing it from the outside does not give you the impression that it would be this awesome from the inside I would highly recommend it.",
          "Great tapestries, great arquitecture. beatiful cathedral. Worth the visit. No photos allowed. It is a must see in Zaragoza",
          "I did not have that much time to spend in this Cathedral. I wish I had had more because it is well worth spending the time. Each church seems to have something the other one doesn't. Burgos and Leon are two; La Seo and the Pilar are beautiful in their own way. La Seo's art",
          "Right across from the Basilica and located on the Plaza de la Seo. It is a Gothic style cathedral built over the remains of a mosque. The stone and art work is more impressive than the Basilica but it also allows no photos. You just have to go home with memories. It features an",
          "Strange to have a Cathedral right across the street from a Basilica , but this was a lovely church. 4 Euro's to enter , but really disappointed that we couldn't take photo's , even with the flash off. Can understand if Mass was going on , but that wasn't the case , so fell a bit",
          "When looking from Plaza del Pilar you see eye-catching cathedral\u2019s tower and rather unimpressive fa\u00e7ade. However after a visit inside and taking a stroll through Calle Sepulcro you\u2019ll leave with completely different impression. It was much more interesting inside than the nearby",
          "A stunning mixture of style, La Seo has everything an architecture buff is looking for. Peaceful, majestic and somewhat overshaddowed by the Pilar, you mustn't miss out on this jewel in the crown of Zaragoza.",
          "There is no shortage of Churchs and Cathedrals in Zaragoza. This one is very grand and had a nice tapestry attached.",
          "An interesting building for the various combination of architectural styles of which it is composed. Magnificent fluted ceiling, all recently cleaned and restored. A great place to cool down on a hot day.",
          "This is a very nice Cathedral with a mix of different styles (from Jewish to roman and arab...). You can see on its walls the evolution of the building over the centuries. Inside is very nice but dont open all time.",
          "A magnificent, very serene and spiritual place to see in Zaragoza. It is overshadowed by the Basilica, but the small fee to tour it is well worth what you will see. Incredible carvings, altars, and stone work. Quiet, but inspiring background music played all during our visit.",
          "What a beautiful place just to wander. So many different styles in this church. The main alter is mesmorizing and the tapestries are worth a visit.",
          "This church sits in the shadow of the huge cathedral, but its stonework is more impressive. Looking at the church from the plaza, travel around to the left side and view the intricate patterns from the narrow street.",
          "We liked this more than the Basilica. The stonework is far better and the atmosphere is more peaceful. The only problem is that you aren't allowed to take photographs. I understand that it is a place of worship, but they charge for entrance and that also makes it a place of",
          "Loved this place. It has so much going on, and is very informative about its history. This was almost a combination of a church and a museum. The tapestries were very interesting. I know a little Spanish, not enough to be fluent, so a lot of what I learned was translated",
          "There are many reasons to visit the Cathedral: the wonderful white stone, the patterned mudejar outside wall, the ornate baroque tower, the high gothic vaulting, the organ, the great golden altarpiece, the royal Aragonese tombs\u2026 Also some interesting side-chapels. One is",
          "Although I thought the Basilica was good, this beats the Basilica into a cocked hat. There are so many beautiful things to see. I took so long on walking around the church, I really did not have the time to take a careful look at the tapestries, which are also well worth",
          "Overshadowed by the more popular Basilica, but every bit a worthy. Look upwards, the ceilings are truly magical. Check opening times as they close during the middle of the day",
          "Like I stated in another review for the <<Basilica del Pilar>>, this place is just right for a walk and taking pictures. Surroundings are beautiful architecture pieces.",
          "pity it starts at 10am, no pictures allowed inside. Nice museum of tapistry inside. Huge dome with vaults",
          "The arches are impressive inside this church. I would say even more impressive than Basilica de Pilar. Definitely a recommended place to visit. The only drawback- there is an entrance fee, while basilica is for free.",
          "This place was fabulous and the tapestry collection was outstanding. Unfortunately, I was busy putting my money away at the ticket counter and didn't see the \"no photos\" sign. (At the Basilica, they had signs throughout reminding you not to take pictures.) After I had taken",
          "One of the best Cathedrals in Spain. Really worthwile the visit!! Was the place where the kings were enthroned in the middle ages.",
          "There is nothing wrong with this building, but if you already saw 3 cathedrals of this type, you saw them all. The only interesting part to me was the decorated mud\u00e9jar style outside wall which is really beautiful. (Only one side is decorated.) So if you have seen less than 3",
          "This cathedral is the most beautiful in Zaragoza where you can see inside all the arts in one place.....I recommend a guided visit.",
          "This Cathedral is well worth a visit. Just down the Plaza from the Basilica,doesn't look much from the outside,but amazing inside,I think it is more beautiful than the Basilica itself. For only 4 euros,you can spend up to an hour looking around,and we also saw the beautiful",
          "This church is a lot more impressive to me than it's bigger neighbor - Nuestra Senora del Pilar, and it's a lot bigger inside than you might think when walking up to it.",
          "A place of overwhelming intricacy, beauty and - yes - spirituality. Countless hours of work must have been put into creating this unique piece of art and you can still feel the fervor that must have driven the many creators and contributors. A place that does not only make you",
          "This cathedral has a square base and somehow this creates a very human dimension. I felt welcome, rather than intimidated as one can feel in big cathedrals. More like a moorish mosque with its human-sized proportions. The geometry apart, the interior is stunning. It is quiet",
          "a breath taking interior..... the structural framing is seemingly gothic but the plan (layout) is anything but. the building has been altered and changed and modified for many centuries for many reasons. must admit, the building maintains an amasingly high degree of integrity",
          "The Cathedral, together with the Bas\u00edlica, are two of the things you can't miss when you visit the city. La Seo is located over the old Roman forum, and is a mixture of many diferent artistic styles, from the Romanesque to apses or its stunning mudejar wall in the outer part to",
          "Being inside the cathedral is a privilege because is full of paintings, sculptures and history. I loved to be there",
          "The centre of Zaragoza has a lot to engage the visitor. Some places shout louder than others! The Cathedral doesn't shout for your attention so it is easy to miss it. But what a shame that would be. It is truly beautiful inside - must nicer and more peaceful than El Pilar - and",
          "Located at the end of the same square as El Pilar, and near the new underground Roman forum site, the Cathedral features some lovely Arabic decoration on its walls and some intricate carvings on the tower. But it is inside where the cathedral is at its most glorious. It is a",
          "What has been said by others is true: this is a not-to-be-missed attraction. One of the interesting things about this church is the abundance of natural light that pours through the many windows, none of which are stained glass. The tapestry museum is fascinating.",
          "First time I managed to see it after over 25 years work. Don't miss it. It's much more interesting. (For the architecture) than the basilica. Indeed worth the visit, particularly the main altar. Try to have a guided visit so you enjoy all details",
          "This cathedral is really a jewel in Zaragoza, it is a place where you can feel the devotion of the people and appreciate the fine art of the building.",
          "Almost hidden in the shadows of the basilica this church reeks of great architecture, and history. Many of the side chapels are jaw-dropping in terms of their designs and use of vivid colors. Of particular note is the Tapestry museum which is located within the structure. Some",
          "The cathedral is quite an interesting place to visit, with over 20 chapels of various styles that are each interesting in their own way. Cavernous, even with a decent number of people in there it didn't feel too crowded. The downside was no photos were allowed.",
          "The cathedral is not the biggest in Spain, but has a spacious, gothic, white interior with plenty of details. The main retablo is rather impressive, and there are many smaller altars with artworks in gothic, renassance and baroque styles. Do also have a look at the exterior",
          "Don't miss this cathedral, it's perfect. It dates back to the 13-th century and it is authentic. If you come there, don't forget to visit the Tapestries museum which is inside.",
          "The left navata is spectacular, check the Capilla del los arcangeles, with a wonderful renaissance portal and wonderful azulejos.",
          "La Seo is also a cathedral. In Zaragoza, most people are more drawn to El PIlar, which is the host of the image of Our Lady of The Pillar\". The artistic value of La Seo, though, is greater and you should definitely visit it. Each chapel has a different decoration.",
          "Perhaps due to the size of the Basilica del Pilar and its religious importance, one has the sensation that the Cathedral Seo del Salvador is somehow less important: nothing could be more wrong. It's an architectural gold mine (both inside and outside) as well as a very pleasant",
          "Lovely Medieval cathedral. It was closed for 18 years while the interior was cleaned and it is now a bright and luminous place. One chapel has been left as it was so you can appreciate the incredible change. Interesting chapels and monuments. Don't forget to walk around the",
          "La Seo Cathedral is located in the Plaza de la Seo, and is impressive, huge, with everything inside with a white color. The church was built in 1316 and the style is Gothic-Mudejar. The exterior still shows the brick and the glazed tiles used in the Mudejar design. Many of",
          "The cathedral being beside el Pilar could be overlooked but do so at your peril. it houses many outstanding tapestries.",
          "Be sure to see the north outside wall of this building, an outstanding example of Mudejar art and architecture. The interior includes a museum of medeival tapestries.",
          "An interesting church to visit but not as spectacular as the Basilica. At all costs visit the tapestry museum which is attached and for which you get a ticket included. that alone is worth the visit.",
          "La Seo is a seemingly smaller, elegant cathedral next to the Nuestra Senora del Pilar. What makes this cathedral a really outstanding sight is that the inside part is composed of some 20 smaller chapels, each one belonging to different period and possessing its own style and",
          "This is one of the \"must-sees\" of Zaragoza: you could spend hours admiring the artwork in the different chapels, except that if the sun isn't shining...yes, that happens in Spain too...then the chapels are a bit dim. And of course the altar-piece is amongst the most",
          "I thought it was the best Cathedral that I visited on a two week trip to Spain that included Barcelona and Girona. And don't miss the attached museum of tapestries.",
          "Worth seeing, even if you aren't a church person. It's a very interesting blend of cultures.",
          "This is a most unusual cathedral, very different on the inside (very ornate) than the outside (relatively plain). No photos allowed, which I understand, but for once no gift shop and no postcards available at the local shops either. Definitely a must see, but I am sorry not to",
          "Stunning church. Entrance fee of 3 euros well worth the charge.",
          "The craftsmanship is astonding in the interior, especially the High Altarpiece. A fee is charged for enterance but it is worth it. It includes a gallery of very old tapestries.",
          "beautiful cathedral in very nice surroundings;recently restored,worth to visit",
          "Not to miss the cathedral of Zaragoza, you could be wron if you dont visit this jewel of arquitecture, you need to pay an entrance fee but is worth a 30 minute visit. Get an audio guide.",

          "From the outside you wouldn't know what is inside this gem - so many differently designed chapels. I really enjoyed walking around and seeing them all.",
          "This church is THE cathedral of Zaragoza. The only one. And it is an amazing experience to visit it. What it has of discretness has it the same for beauty. Justo to say that this church worths alone a trip to Zaragoza."

        "wiki": "Antigua Guatemala (Spanish pronunciation: [an\u02c8ti\u0263wa \u0263wate\u02c8mala]), commonly referred to as just Antigua or la Antigua, is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala known for its preserved Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture as well as a number of ruins of colonial churches. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nAntigua Guatemala serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It also serves as the departmental capital of Sacatep\u00e9quez Department.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe city had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the 1990s. At the time of the 2007 census, the city had 34,685 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAntigua Guatemala means \"Old Guatemala\" and was the third capital of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kakchikel-Maya city, now called Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524\u2014the day of Saint James\u2014and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemalan (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally, St. James became the patron saint of the city.After several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, which is a neighborhood in the municipality of Ciudad Vieja. This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541, by a devastating lahar from the Volc\u00e1n de Agua. As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time five miles away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543, the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala, a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas.\nSantiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, besides modern state of Chiapas in Mexico.  After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n de Agua a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.The city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square.  Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza.  Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general. The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls.  The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called \"Valley of Guatemala\" and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.Due to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565. In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico and the new organization was called Audiencia of Guatemala.The Franciscan friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected.  This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one. The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala: Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are. Notable students included Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando, Thomas Merlo, and Alonso de Paz.\n\nThe first building of a cathedral was begun in 1545 with the debris brought from the destroyed settlement in the valley of Almolonga; however, its construction was hampered by frequent earthquakes throughout the years.  The city was the final resting place of the great Spanish chronicler Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, and his remains were interred in one of the churches that was eventually ruined by earthquakes.\nThe construction of the royal houses for the residence of the Captain General and the members of the Real Audiencia started in 1558; the complex also included the Royal Treasury, jail, Army quarters, the Hall of Arms, and the housing of Audiencia members.In the sixteenth century, there were several important earthquakes on the following dates: \n\nMarch 21, 1530\nSeptember 11, 1541\n1565 (exact date unknown)\n1575 (exact date unknown)\nNovember 30, 1577\nDecember 23, 1585In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain gave it the title of \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\" (\"Very Noble and Very Loyal\").\n\n\n=== 17th-century events ===\n\nThe Jesuits founded the school of \"San Lucas of the Society of Jesus\" in 1608, which became famous and was unrivaled in terms of literature and grammar lessons;  it was attended by the elite nobles of the city society, such as Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the chronicler Francisco V\u00e1zquez, and Pedro Betancourt.  On 18 July 1626, the Jesuit temple was inaugurated; along with the rest of the city, it suffered and was damaged by continuous earthquakes that struck the city between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.The monks of San Juan de Dios founded their hospital and monastery in 1636 and thereafter were in charge of the hospitals in the Kingdom of Guatemala.  Their hospitals were: \n\nSan Alejo: for indigenous people\nSan Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel\nSantiago: for Spanish and mulattos\nSan L\u00e1zaro\nSan Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the Dominicans who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.The temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri.  Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the \"San Francisco de Borja\" where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, S.J., eventually would study and serve as principal.\nIn the seventeenth century there were two types of nuns: discalced and urban.\n\n\n==== Saint Hermano Pedro ====\nPedro de San Jos\u00e9 Betancourt came to Guatemalan land in 1650 from his native Tenerife. Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed.  After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor. Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz's brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas.  He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies.  Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.\n\n\n==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====\n\nFrancisco Marroqu\u00edn, first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for Guatemala, but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroqu\u00edn left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the \"Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino school\"- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as M\u00e9xico City in the New Spain. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, \"Marroqu\u00edn's testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroqu\u00edn never talks about a University, much less establishing one...\" On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the University that \"was being asked of the crown\".The Jesuits opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other regular clergy orders -Mercedarians, Franciscans and Order of Preachers- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues. In August 1655, the Society of Jesus had bought the whole lot from the D\u00edaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees. In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala. The school was the city's most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.After several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, king Carlos II expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala to establish its university or \"General Study.\" After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor Jos\u00e9 de Ba\u00f1os y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the M\u00e9xico University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.\nThe first classes given in the university were:\n\nCanonic law\nMedicine\nScholastic theology\nMoral theology\nLanguagesThe Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the Papal Bull of Pope Innocent XI, issued and dated 18 June 1687.\n\n\n=== 18th-century events ===\n\n\n==== San Miguel Earthquake ====\n\nThe strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717.  At that time, the power of the Catholic Church over the Spanish Empire's citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment.  In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.On August 27 there was a strong eruption of Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, which lasted until August 30;  the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego.  On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel.  Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00 p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock.  The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.The San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed.  There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured. These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity.  City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable.  The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there was additional work done by Porres until 1736.\n\n\n==== San Casimiro earthquake ====\nOn March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more.  The church roof of the Society of Jesus complex fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild.  Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed. In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system.  A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.\n\n\n==== Santa Marta earthquake ====\n\nOn 12 June 1773 Captain General Mart\u00edn de Mayorga was inaugurated, and alongside Cort\u00e9s y Larr\u00e1z and the regular clergy vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.In 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).The Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus.  Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the \"Casa de Ejercicios\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \"Virgin valley\" was authorized.  This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala.  However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.\n\n\n=== 19th-century events ===\n\n\n==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====\n\nAfter the independence of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n and the establishment of a secular government. The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms.As of 1850, Antigua had an estimated population of 9,000. and by 1865, the building was functioning as a vapor activated thread mill, but it was not profitable due to a lack of expert technicians and raw material; and by 1872, the Jesuits were once again expelled from Guatemala by the liberal regime of Justo Rufino Barrios.In 1884 City Hall made an announcement that it intended to transform the old Society of Jesus buildings into a market, in spite of the strong opposition from the neighbors that already had small shops on the plaza.  It was not until 1912 that a market was placed in the complex.\n\n\n=== 20th-century events ===\n\nIn April 1920, during the very last days of Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime, prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited Antigua Guatemala and wrote about his impressions of the city in his book Between two continents. His book is an objective description of the terrible conditions the road and the ruins used to be in: \"For some little way outside Guatemala City it was a fairly decent car ride, but then the roads began developing sand drifts, and later, rockfalls of tumbled stone as two years earlier, the country had been devastated by a powerful earthquake and government corruption made the recovery impossible\".  \"The hills grew steeper and steeper, the jolting more pronounced and the stones even sharper; besides, on top of the road was a two-foot layer of dust which hid the pitfalls but did not detract from their effect\".  \"Along the way, they passed long lines of Indians on their way to Guatemala City, carrying their heavy burdens with apparent ease; men, women and children carried something in the way of a load, and they all carried it quickly. With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons\".After passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died.  After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua.  The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns. Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920, and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions.  In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.But there were other monuments in decent shape: \n\nThe Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing.  The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.\nThe old Capuchin monastery with its many underground passages from the monks' cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.\n\n\n== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==\n\nCentral Park \u2013 Parque Central \u2013 is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (Semana Santa) and Easter (Pascua). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local parishes sponsors a Procession through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions' paths.Due to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHistorically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala. Tourism is the main driver of the economy.  Antigua is also a coffee-producing region of Anacaf\u00e9.\n\n\n== Language schools ==\nAntigua is known as a destination for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for studying the Spanish language by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAntigua GFC football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo, which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed Los panzas verdes (\"Green bellies\") and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThere are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/Chapin breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade tortillas. Throughout Antigua you can find many cuisines from around the world: Mediterranean, Italian, Asian, American, and British pies and French pastries.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAntigua is served by two main hospitals, Hospital Nacional Pedro de Bethancourt and a Guatemalan Institute of Social Security hospital. Emergency medical services are provided by Bomberos Municipales (Guatemala) and Bomberos Voluntarios (Guatemala), who have both previously worked with LFR International to improve prehospital care.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThree large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua. The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the Volc\u00e1n de Agua or \"Volcano of Water\", some 3,766 metres (12,356 ft) high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunap\u00fa (and they still do). However, it became known as Volc\u00e1n de Agua after a lahar from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village San Miguel Escobar.\nTo the west of the city are a pair of peaks, Acatenango, which last erupted in 1972, some 3,976 metres (13,045 ft) high, and the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego or \"Volcano of Fire\", some 3,763 metres (12,346 ft) high. \"Fuego\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities.  It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala.  Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Lanqu\u00edn (Semuc Champey), or Tikal, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City. Antigua is also known for its chocolate makers.\n\n\n=== Spanish Colony monuments ===\n\nBefore it was declared a National Monument by president Jorge Ubico on March 30, 1944, the city ruins were practically abandoned. The following galleries show images of the destruction of the structures due to earthquakes and abandonment. There were other churches, such as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen and the Society of Jesus, that endured the 1773 earthquake relatively well, but they were abandoned and the earthquakes from 1917\u201318 and 1976 destroyed them. In the particular case of de San Francisco El Grande church, it was in good structural condition after the 1773 and 1917 earthquakes, and it was rebuilt in 1967 when the Franciscans returned to Guatemala. This eventually protected the structure from significant damage in the 1976 earthquake. Finally, La Merced church was practically new in 1773, and it has withstood time and earthquakes since; the church was not abandoned in 1776, but it was indeed abandoned in 1829 when the Mercedarians were expelled from Central America by general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, along with the rest of regular clergy and the conservative party members and Aycinena family.\n\n\n=== Holy Week ===\n\nThe most traditional processions are:\n\n\n== In films ==\n\n\n=== The New Adventures of Tarzan (1935) ===\n\nIn 1935, the film The New Adventures of Tarzan, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico. The places where the filming was made were:\n\nChichicastenango: scenes of a native town where the explorers first met.\nAntigua Guatemala: The Green Goddess temple\nR\u00edo Dulce\nPuerto Barrios: arrival and departure of the boats carrying the explorers\nTikal: jungle scenes\nQuirigu\u00e1: Mayan city where they get lectured on the Maya civilization\nGuatemala City: then luxurious Palace Hotel was used to shoot the scenes of the hotel in the imaginary town of At Mantique\n\n\n=== The Border: 1982 ===\n\nThe initial earthquake sequences from the Jack Nicholson film The Border were filmed in Antigua Guatemala, specifically in La Recoleccion Architectural Complex.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntigua Guatemala has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cwb).\n\n\n== Geographic location ==\nAntigua Guatemala is surrounded by the municipalities of Sacatep\u00e9quez:\n\n\n== See also ==\n Guatemala portal\nGuatemala City\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Antigua Guatemala at Wikimedia Commons\n Antigua Guatemala travel guide from Wikivoyage\nMunicipality Website\nLa Merced, Antigua Guatemala\nGuatelinda\nMaps:\nLa ruta maya: Antigua Guatemala Map\nAntigua Guatemala films documentaries:\n1934 in Antigua Guatemala\n1950 in Antigua Guatemala",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields.

          "An AV presentation amidst the preserved ruins transports you to the days when the town was called Caesaraugusta. This along with models of the port and form are very instructive. We found this museum better done than museums in Italy and elsewhere. There are four roman museums",
          "Very interesting Museum. Self guided with a hand held audio guide. Roman remains are well displayed and explained. Free entry for over 65\u2019s - take proof! Photocopy of passport sufficient for entry, but if you want an audio guide you need to leave something of value - passport,",
          "it's worth visiting, very well maintained, small gem hidden in the tight old streets of the old city",
          "As impressive as it was to learn of the achievements of ancient Zaragoza, especially where public waterworks were concerned, it is just as impressive to witness the extent to which modern Zaragozans have gone to preserve the antiquity. Beautiful displays of ancient life.",
          "Nice collection, history roman empire. just walking distance from Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar",
          "The museum is not too big, but not too small either. It's a must visit while you're in the city center imho. The remains of the Roman culture with detailed descriptions of the daily life make it quite an unique experience.",
          "You can see the actual remains of the city and also a model thta gives you an idea of how people lived in the Roman times",
          "I was surprised by the extent of the excavations, right under the main plaza. Attached museum is very informative. A must if you're interested in Zaragoza's Roman past.",
          "I didn't really know much about Zaragoza and was surprised to learn that it was an old Roman city, established in the name of Caesar Augustus from whom the final name of the city was derived. This small museum gives you one picture of what the city looked like in Roman times.",
          "Museo del Foro de Caesaraugusta is located in the old part of the city and it is one of the four museums about roman history of Caesaraugusta, the name of Zaragoza in the Roman period. It is the second biggest museum and here you can see some 3D-expositions and ruins of this",
          "We try to see everything a place has to offer when we visit, so we bought the combined ticket for four related attractions - the Roman forum, port, baths and theatre. It cost 7 euros and I went free as a pensioner (they're very good like that in Spain).",
          "This & the Roman Amphitheatre were the best out of the 4 sights you can see if you buy a 7 euro combined ticket to the Caesaugusta museums. I'd only go if you have plenty of time in Zaragoza & have seen the other major sights. This mainly shows the way the city received fresh",

          "The second of the four municipal museums tracing Zaragoza's Roman past, this one is another winner. The entrance is a modern stone and glass pavilion that pops out of the ground in front of the cathedral Seo; it turns out that a large Roman forum was built on the same site",

          "With Hoya paintings, this large basilica is a must see in Zaragoza. The plaza in front of it is impressive and its and easy walk down the shopping Avenue to the El Tubo tapas area. Take the elevator ride up the tower",
          "There are many Basilicas in the world. This doesn\u2019t make top 10 but still worth a visit. It lacks details and particulars, not sure if you know what I mean. It feels dull, flat, imperfect, something is missing. The colored roofs don\u2019t make it any better either, I think this is",
          "Had great expectations of visiting the basilica and would have been more than happy to pay a fee in lieu of information of the history. (Think they\u2019ve missed a trick here). All over the place were posters advising no photos to be taken no back packs etc. Yet there was no",
          "Not as grand as some of the others is Spain, but still worth a walk through. Outside has great artwork.",
          "One of the few nice cathedrals in Spain, still in use that makes it special. Shame to skipp if you are around",

          "I'm told you are not allowed to insult the cathedral to any Zaragozians, but I don't think you would need to! It is a more modern building created around an ancient one, but it has been very beautifully done. It is busy, but not terribly so, and is a huge space with plenty to",
          "Free to get in and what an amazing building. Well worth a visit and walk around to see such a historic building.",

          "Amazingly large. Very busy and so easy to get to, just follow the signs. Easy and good value parking in the Plaza in front. Lots to see inside including a couple of bombs dropped during the civil war, not at all expected.",
          "I would say that historically Santiago de Compostela's church in Galicia is Spain's most important church but I without doubt would say that the most beautiful is the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar. It's soaring bell towers and domes of colored tiles force visitor's eyes",
          "You can't drive into Zaragoza and miss this Basilica. While we didn't have time to go in the architecture is spectacular and we certainly took the photo opportunity. If the outside is this good the inside is well worth it. We were passing through on our way to Bilbao and will",
          "With a beautiful architecture from the outside at first sight it gives an impression of some small castle with stunning tombs. Once you enter this church it stunns you further with it\u2019s arches, paintings and wood carving work. It holds a mother Mary pillar which is believed to",

          "As impressive inside as outside. There are no words to describe. Tried to take pictures, but they are as miserable as any words in trial to describe :) During our stay we were getting back several times, and it was still not enough. If Saragossa is not on your route, worth",
          "The Basilica is located on a walking promenade where you\u2019ll enjoy visiting the Church. The location is great, where you will easily find restaurants and cafes parallel to the church. Get your self a drink or a cup of coffee and enjoy the surroundings that takes you back in",

          "This is a fantastic landmark and an amazing building, but fells almost more like an railway station than a cathedral, maybe it's the brick architecture... so huge on the inside that it is a rather impersonal space.",

          "Free entrance into thai beautiful basilica. The copolas are impressive and the peacefulness of it are nice in a bustling city. No pictures allowed or hats, cell phone use etc.",
          "It's a monster of a church mostly in barock style with strange neo classic pillars in the inside, with mess and all the hokuspokus all day long, the best thing is the one tower in the back where you can go up with an elevator which gives a wonderful view of the city",
          "Considered one of the main attractions in Zaragoza, this Basilica is huge! Dare i say almost a city block (short block) long. While visiting, there was a small chapel within holding a mass. A number of Patrons in attendance since Spain is still a very Catholic stronghold. Many",

          "Before coming to Zaragoza we had read that this was a wonderful building; and we certainly found this to be true. We were - and still are - bowled over by its beauty, especially the exterior. Despite its great size, the Basilica is not heavy or imposing. People from all over",
          "The Plaza is wonderful and as the largest building this Basilica makes an impressive contribution to the architecture. The coloured tiles and some of the detailing on the front elevation is wonderful. However inside it is cavernous and lacks atmosphere; there are a series of",

          "And we were so lucky. We were there on a day when an annual public event, the celebration of (as best we understood it) first responders (civil guard, military, ambulance etc). Military bands, presentations, singing, public speaking and awarding, all lovingly took place in",
          "This basilica is one of nicest I\u2019ve seen. For visitors only a third of it was avalable but it\u2019s worth it to have a look inside. Sadly, no pictures are allowed inside.",
          "Bas\u00edlica close to the Ebro river which is Zaragoza\u2019s landmark. Can be seen when entering the city from the north. Building is not the most ancient building in Zaragoza, first steps built in XIII and it has need refurbished many times. Last time in XX. Is a must visiting",

          "Huge venue, very popular/busy, atmospheric. Without trying to be dis-respectful, this would make a terrific location for a Star Wars palace. Stunning architecture. Only negative: electric candles, makes offerings to loved one seem a little commercial. A must see in Zaragoza -",
          "We didn't get a tour, but enjoyed walking around both outside and in. There was a noon service in the small chapel we got to watch.",
          "The big church is a mix of styles and periods. You can take pictures and strolling around in silence because there are ceremonies at the weekend. I was looking for the statue of Mary but it is quite small..so follow the people to find it...the light all around is",

          "We came here at a time when a service was in. Then organ is amazing. Like most European church\u2019s it\u2019s beautiful inside. You could feel the guilt. Worth the walk around.",
          "This is probably the prettiest place in the city and the view from the bridge next to it is just lovely. It is particularly nice to see at night. Entry is free - photos are not allowed inside, but it is nice just to soak up the experience without documenting",

          "Meh. Good for Catholics, I guess. For me, I just angry about the wasted money by the church. Over the top decoration.",

          "So much of European history is told in the large cathedrals in the old cities. And this is certainly no exception. You wonder how they built these magnificent edifices then with zero of the technology or mechanics we have today. But they not only built them but they built them",

          "From the moment I first saw it, as I approached the bridge to walk into the old town, I was stunned, I have never seen such a beautiful building. The inside also has so much beauty, like a previous reviewer, I think in this day and age, they shoul allow no flash photography.",

          "I\u2019m the type of person who likes to swing by churches to enjoy the architecture, but I\u2019m not one to stick around long. I felt similarly about this one, but I would say there\u2019s something special about this massive Basilica. The roof was particularly lovely and I don\u2019t regret",

However, Pilar has something of an aura and reputation about it, and the air and stories of miracles are well reputed. I\u2019m a Catholic so it was natural for me to visit.

          "Well worth a visit. No cameras or noise please. Guided tours available but not necessary to appreciate the basilica",
          "This huge cathedral is really beautiful from the outside with its semi-Moorish dome design. There's also a ceiling painted by Goya inside. It's not as elaborate as another nearby Cathedral called La Seo but the real highlight is a trip up the bell tower to give you a 360",
          "This is an extremely large basilica with stunning altars, ceiling frescos and stained windows. The size alone is awe inspiring. There are 6 cupolas and 4 towers. The domes are beautifully carved and also have coloured mosaic tile trim. It is a \u201cmust see\u201d even if you think you",

          "We spent about 30 minutes in the church. The interior was amazing. Highly recommend taking the time to visit this beautiful basilica.",
          "Given it's a Basilica it's not surprising it's big but it felt like three churches in one and had little atmosphere as a result. However from the outside it's truly amazing. I think they should give up the plastic candles - go back to real ones and add atmosphere.",

          "The outside of the building is splendid and most impressive, set on the square. The inside was to me disappointing particularly the electric candles rather made it look like a commercial opportunity than a place of worship.",
          "We love old churches and cathedrals so this was a must see. Down to the shrine to \"our lady\" and the Goya relief on one part of the ceiling. The usual wander around all the different chapesl and interesting to watch a service whilst tourists like us mingled with the congregation",

          "Very impressive church in the center of the city. The outside is pretty at night, I'd recommend seeing it at night from across the river.",
          "I found the exterior more attractive than the interior, which is expansive but in some places rather gloomy. The ambiance was enhanced by the service taking place at noon. Some remarkable architecture inside and outside. Lovely coloured tiled roofs.",
          "Lived near here for 3 years, a beautiful sight inside and out. Worth a visit and then an ice-cream in the plaza!",
          "Wonderful basilica blending different architecture styles. It is the primary attraction in Zaragoza. We were told that the original small church built on this site was destroyed, and it took about 300 years to complete the current structure in the 1960's. Admission is free and",
          "The church has a great architecture. I didn't manage to see inside but the outer architecture is amazing.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous, do go inside. It's one of the most spectacular churches I've ever seen. Unfortunately, they don't let you take pictures inside, but it's still very worth visiting.",
          "I previously declared the cathedral in Salamanca to be the most beautiful in Europe. Today I visited the cathedral in Zaragoza and may have changed my mind. This is on spectacular cathedral, not to be missed if you have a chance to visit it.",
          "Beautiful and full of history - definitely worth the time. No pictures allowed and wonderful experience.",
          "Even if you are not a religious person, this cathedral is one-of-a-kind. The history behind and the art within (Goya e.g.) are simply breathtaking. This monument is regrettably underrated. It should be one of the \"must-see\" atractions not only in Spain but also in Europe.",
          "This place is one of the absolute highlights of zaragoza with its astonishing architecture, rich interior and particular identity , set in a very nice zone of the city . Entrance free",
          "This is THE place to visit...for its history and meaning. The roofs are seen from far and away and the tilework, characteristic and wonderful. Inside...it is huge...so there is no feeling of coziness but of grandieur. The main altar to Virgin of Pilar (or 'Pilarica') is THE best",
          "This is a very nice baroque-style Basilica and well worth a visit. It's free to enter but in order to have a chance to walk around and see it all, you should plan your visit to avoid the mass times (which are quite frequent!). The hours are posted at the entrance. The",
          "It is one of the best known of the Spanish churches. A very large building. Nice interior and impressive silhouette. Try having a look at it from the oposite side of the Ebro river.",
          "just go and marvel at how they built this impressive building which is free to enter then pay the 3 euros and go up the tower and take in the views a must see",
          "This is a stunning Basilica with a multi-colored, tile roof. It has four corner towers and you can take an elevator up one of them to see some stunning views of the city and the Basilica from above. If you want, you can climb a few flights of stairs for an even better view.",
          "Come and marvel at the size and eloquence of this basilica and lose yourself in the complex interplay of the architectural styles. Definitely a must see in Zaragoza!",
          "The basilica is the main symbol of Zaragoza and it's beautiful as the central piece of the city. Inside there's plenty of saints to worship and you can walk around for 20 min without a problem. However it's more stoic from the outside and the church bells are worth listening",
          "This building is stunning inside and out. No charge to visit, and there are treasures within. An absolute must-do if you're in Zaragoza, it's on the main square and is awesome.",
          "the only place in zaragoza I realy enjoyed. make sure you visit this place at night after 9pm. there are many restaurants across this place that yo seat outside drink your wine and enjoy the magnificent view. also take a short walk to the bridge on the river where you panoramic",

          "I did like the basilica but the same as the other spanish churches. The outside at sundown is impressive with those towers especially looking at then from river Ebro",
          "We saw the cathedral at night first. It was beautifully lit. Fascinating interior and good to be able to see it when a service is in progress.",
          "This is the top must first cultural visit in Saragossa. It is the emblem of the city and one of the most impressive religious temples in Spain.",
          "This is soo much more then the Notre Dame of anything else. See the majestic building from the bridge over the Ebro first and then visit the inside. Find the bombs that fell through the roof but never exploded :)",
          "The interior of the Basilica is absolutely stunning. It's massive as well. You can still enter during Mass, but only on the right side of the building. There are a lot of children and babies here. They all line up to have a photo (and be blessed?). It's of Catholic spiritual",
          "we arrived on Pilar holiday and I really recommend to visit Zaragoza this time to feel the soul of the city",
          "Lovely Basilica, free to visit anytime. See the famous Statue of the Pilar and also on the opposite wall behind the statue you can actually touch a part of the \"Pilar\" Beautiful plaza built in front of the church.",

          "We came to see the fiesta del pilar and were mesmerized by the beauty of the traditional costumes, the mountain of flowers and the cathedral itself",
          "Wonderful Church full of character , should be seen. Worth walking around the whole church. Wonderful paintings and sculptures.",
          "While internal photos are not permitted, my memories of various parts of this magnificent church will remain with me forever. Basilica de Nuestro Se\u00f1ora del Pilar sits between the Rio Ebro and the equally magnificent plaza Plaza del Catedrales. The Basilica is composed of a",
          "Legend has it that the Virgin Mary came to this spot and placed a pillar on it. There is a special shrine to this pillar, and it is a sacred spot for devout Catholics. The church is truly beautiful; there are many capellas enriched with silver and gold dedicated to saints",
          "A good way to spend a couple of hours both inside and out. They do Gothic architecture big style in Spain.",
          "Basilica itself was amazing. Stunning architecture. It's still active and we were lucky to be there while a service was taking place. We liked their \"electronic candles\" approach - some might find it un-traditional, but I though it was great from an environmental perspective.",
          "A very interesting building. Take some time to lean about the history to fully appreciate your visit. I would suggest visiting at different times of day. During the day the basilica is open to the public and there are several masses that you can join in or just watch. It is then",
          "Sit in the magnificent plaza and feast your eyes on this building, truly stunning both day and night when lit up. However be prepared for the inside. Not great and personally found it dreary and uninspiring. Try to make Saturday to be there. Its wedding day, at least 6 brides",
          "Just visiting only this cathedral worth coming to Zaragoza. It was the first church where I saw small electric bulbs instead of candles.",
          "best views from the opposite bank of the river Ebro. square in fromt of the basilica is very touristic.",
          "Beautiful place for prayer, inspiring story with miraculous events taking place, bombs not exploding, healings and all this from the beginning of the Christianity, nearly 2000 years old devotions!",
          "This cathedral totally dominates the large square and creates a magnificent cityscape and public space there. But inside it is strangely divided into smaller spaces than one would expect, none really impressive. A true connoisseur may find much to admire but for the average",
          "free to go in amazing building inside and out loads of chapels within art work and carvings a must to see",
          "An amazing place, it's ornate, it's diverse. Origins and history, it's been built over centuries trying to out do the other cathedral in Zaragoza, this place dominates Zaragoza and is the centre of th best festivals, I'm not overly religious but love this site and Zaragoza for",
          "I love the grand place, The two Cathedrals: the bas\u00edlica de Ntra. Sra del Pilar and The Catedral La Seo.",
          "Totally different in design than any other cathedrals we visited. Stands majestic with its colorful domes and pillars. You could even spot the site from a distance on the A 2 highway. We were there end of the daylight and we also saw it when lights came on in the dark. Even",
          "We stopped in Zaragoza in the later afternoon to break up our drive from Barcelona to San Sebastian. The Basilica so dominated the skyline of the city that it made the GPS unnecessary. In a word, the exterior is striking.... different from any duomo or basilica that I can recall",
          "Very nice, large roofline with some color. The main alter is very impressive. No photos , supposedly allowed. First church given to Mary. Reasonable places to eat in plaza in front of church. Nice.",
          "If you are visiting for religious reasons, the Pilar will no doubt meet your expectations. From a cultural point of view, there may be some elements of architectural or artistic interest here, but they are so swamped in religiosity that it is impossible to appreciate them.",
          "This location is full of shopping and cafe's. I noticed at 8pm that the church bells would ring, and they would play a choir singing. It was very nice.. There are multiple bell towers in the same square, so they politely have them offset so they don't all ring at the same",
          "The place is huge. And free. So whats not to like? It is easy to forget that this is a church (with people praying) and not just a tourist attraction - some tourists were actually taking photos of the priests doing mass (which the security guards did not like! And is very",
          "You can book a tour or take an unescorted walk around. We chose the latter and loved it. The basilica is rich in history and tells a very long story of Zaragoza's occupancy. The chruch community is obvioulsy strong and adds a liveliness and vibrance to anyone fortunate enough to",
          "Get ready to see Goya in its best! I am speechless and when you are done walk East 100 ye=ards to a GOYA Museum, what a treat!",
          "Just go in and wonder. Photos are not allowed but enjoy the memories you take away. You don't have to religious to be affected by this.",
          "I was heading our for dinner when I heard music. I followed the sound and ended up at the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar. It was early in the evening and the building was open. I wandered in and was impressed by the beautiful interior. I plan to go back during the day to",
          "The best time to visit the Basilica in Zaragoza is when they have the festival of Pilar which is on the 12th of October. At this time the Basilica is adorned with a wealth of flowers, which visually is stunning, The towers and the roof tops can be seen for miles, from the",
          "Only part of this money making building is open...big barriers separate the most interesting parts. Security is everywhere and they clearly don't want any visitors. No candles......just an absolutely huge bank of electric ones! No photos, none of this....none of that! It's a",

          "The exterior of this massive structure may be 18thc brickwork, but the effect on the modernised Plaza del Pilar is stunning - especially when lit at night. The big attraction for devout Catholics is the opportunity to kiss the Pilar brought personally by the Virgin Mary to",
          "An amazing sight to see in the heart of Zaragoza! Highly recommended to be on the top of your list of places to see! Had a wonderful visit!",
          "this is a must , the architecture really is breathtaking and the interior has the effect of overwhelming your senses. its a shame that the candles are now battery powered but you can still switch one on to remember a loved one.",

          "This Basilica is a wonderful structure right in the heart of Zaragoza and should be on the top 5 of the To Do list.",
          "Stopped in Zaragoza for only 4 hours and could only visit a couple of places and this one definitely is remarkable and the right choice. An impressive architecture and marvelous decoration. Stepped inside and got chocked with its wonderful details. Couldn't get up to the tower",
          "We stopped in Zaragoza to kick off a driving tour north through Huesca to Jaca and on to Donostia, spectacular architecture and history - we felt like Zaragoza deserved more of our time and this primarily came from the walk through the cathedral. Just wow....",
          "Really impressive building both inside and out. Sitting at a nearby cafe with a drink and tapas watching the light on the building as the sun goes down is lovely!",
          "Enjoyed visiting the church and the tower. The tourist office opens by 10am no brochures available at church explaining anything and you have to cross the street to get these details from tourist office which was over crowded due to late opening. The ascending of the tower was",
          "One of those most incredible Basilicas we have seen, and we have seen many of them! Craftsmanship is extraordinary. Fortunately we were present for the Assumption Feast Day Mass, although we don't speak Spanish we know the 'process', it was beautiful. The organ sound is",
          "Absolutely gorgeous building, so many different frescos on the ceiling, keep those eyes up, absolutely stunning",

          "Having had my fill of Cathedrals, Basilicas, and all things church like I really approached this Basilica in a nonchalant manner. What a mistake. This Basilica is probably the most magnificent I have ever seen, including the Vatican. The craftsmanship on display is simply",
          "Friends in Cantabria said that we must not miss this place, and I was glad that we listened. The place is huge and would take up 3x full size football fields..it has to be seen to be believed. Could only be described as 'churches within churches'...wonderful architecture. I did",
          "Can't take photos inside the basilica, but it helps you enjoy the majestic, ornate, and overwhelming decor. Breathtaking upon entering the building.",
          "This is a very, very beautiful church, one of the many magnificent churches in Spain. It is even more stunning when you view it across the Ebro in the afternoon. This is the first church dedicated to the honor of the Virgin Mary by St. James the Great. We passed by Zaragoza on",
          "It is hard to review this location as nothing can describe it other than a stunning example of church architecture. Inside is equally as impressive as the outside. The central issue as with everything is disrespectful tourists making noise, taking photos (when it asks not too)",
          "On first approach it is difficult to comprehend the enormous size of the basilica until you walk along the frontage, which is a very pleasant pedestrianised area with fountains that many locals and tourists will freely run around in to cool down. It is free to enter, as",
          "We visited the basilica as part of a tour led by a member of the Tourist Office and were advised before entering the Pilar that the security people didn't appreciate the tourists in the basilica. Sue enough we were asked to move on, to stop talking (we weren't!) and they",
          "The splendor and beauty is remarkable. Take the time to see the different chapels. The outside is just as beautiful as the inside of the Basilica.",
          "This is another memorable basilica. Let's start by saying it's free no charge to get in. The inside was beautiful but with a different lay out. Everyone here was wonderful and just very cozy basilica. This is one that if you can an on your way should visit. Enjoy.",
          "This is a Barroque huge church that is a pure show of the people's devotion to Mary, the mother of Jesus. For being Barroque is not that much decorated but on the other hand is extremelly big, an on there it comes its magnificense. A must see on this town.",
          "It was an amazing visit. The moment we entered, mass was starting so we attended the mass. It was such an amazing feeling being inside this church that is hundreds of years old. I can not imaging the work that went on inside of this church. I understand it took hundreds of",

          "The church itself is huge but forgettable I will have to admit. The views of the city and the colorful tiled roof of the church from the tower however is amazing. They charge a small fee to take the elevator up but it is worth it.",
          "OK so it may sound a bit weird to review a lift in a basilica of this much historic significance. But it is truly an exhilarating ride and then climb (I think it was about 4E per person). NOT FOR THE faint hearted. The views out over Z to the plains are spectacular. If you don't",
          "The Basilica is gorgeous inside and out. I really enjoyed looking spires of the roof and the decorative tile that covered many of them. The inside is also full of attractive chapels, and enormous altarpieces and alter canopies. This is a must see if in Zaragoza, and frankly,",
          "I have seen maybe umpteen cathedrals in Europe, but this is really a must see. With its many architectural styles, chapels and exquisite frescoes (including by Goya and Vazquez), don't miss this one. If you can time your visit correctly for a Sunday, the organ is also fantastic.",
          "The Pilar is the at the top of things to do in Zaragoza... The church itself is on a scale that nearly rivals St. Peter's in Rome, it's really that big. The inside is full of chapels and artifacts that truly inspire ... not the least of which are a pair of unexploded bombs",
          "If you visit Zaragoza you shouldnot miss visting this beautiful basilica. Both the inside and the outside have outstanding areas to watch. You will respect what mankind has done in this city when you go around this Basilica. You can take beautiful pictures from the bridges over",
          "Really impressive building. Beautiful both on the inside and from the outside. Thumbs up for not charging anything to enter the church.",

          "The basilica is best seen from across the river and there are great views from the tower - you go part way in a lift, then climb the final part in about steps. Extremely lavish decoration on the various altars. No photography allowed inside, entry is free.",
          "We visited on a super hot summer day it was muggy and too hot for us to stroll around at our leisure sadly. But still you can appreciate the amazing architecture and stature of such a building. It's worth knowing your aren't allowed to take photos inside and also as its a",
          "This was my favorite cathedral of all those we visited in Spain. It's beautifully maintained and is so clearly part of the community instead of a tourist attraction. We happened to visit during a mass and it was wonderful to see the visitors being respectful instead of taking",
          "We were traveling from Barcelona on the way to Bilbao. We had a brief stop in Zaragoza to see the Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Pilar or the Lady of the Pillar. It's located right along the Ebro river and is in the baroque style. It was constructed between 1681 and 1754.",

          "As a couple we stayed 2 nights in Zaragoza. Had a wonderful time walking the Avenida de Independencia, exploring eateries in the \"Tubo' area and yes, we walked the \"Pilar Plaza. What wonderful church with old world grandeur yet very nicely maintained. Very Nice!",

          "Basilica looks very huge. You can go to the observation terrace here. Looks beautiful, especially on sunset.",
          "A huge space plenty of fine art elements and a continuos stream of both local and foreign visitors. Very alive within a religious atmosphere. This visit is a MUST when in the capital of Aragon Region.",
          "Although the holy statuette of Pilar is tiny, the basilica dedicated to her is anything but. This is a stunning piece of architecture on such a grandiose scale it must be seen to be truly appreciated. The entire plaza is a wonderful place to explore and filled with many things",
          "Both the exterior and interior of this holy place are designed to impress religious visitors and tourists. The gold coatings, wood and marble carvings, and frescoes and paintings are stunning. The men's choir's singing during mass was ethereal.",
          "This is a very interesting cathedral, if you get a guided tour it will be even more interesting. Especially the stories about the founding of the church and the stories about the bombing of the cathedral during the civil war. There is not many churches that have bombs as",
          "This is just one of the many wonderful things to see in this surprising city. Huge and interesting, a great place to start.",
          "This huge, domed and tiled church sits in the middle of a vast town square. It attracts a lot of pilgrims and worshippers and there are frequent services. It is an ornate, baroque fantasy, not at all to my taste but it needs to be seen!",
          "We were very impressed by the beauty of the architecture and magnificent condition of this Cathedral showing centuries of history.",
          "Just amazing to wander around and see all the different shrines. The choristers stand is amazing - wooden carved and beautiful. It's so big it really is a beautiful building to visit. Whilst we were there a mass was underway - it's good to see its a living building and not",

          "Absolutely stunning Basilica, and entry free. We took our time admiring the craftsmanship and even stayed for a traditional mass.",
          "One of the only free cathedrals in Spain. Very interesting but not as magnificent as my favourite, Segovia. But Segovia cathedral is not free to enter.",

          "The basilica is free to enter and wow what an impressive place! It's traditional for Spanish children to come here for their conformations so look out for small people in white dresses and well dressed parents. It's fascinating to see inside, but grab a drink at one of the cafes",
          "If you like Baroque, go there, but it is bombastic, pompous, and just too much. Lots of gold, silver, ornaments, paintings, columns, etc.",
          "The site it occupies is magnificent on the bank of the river Ebro. The interior is of a style that I do not like very much. There was a service going on in one part when we visited. Still, we could roam the place.",

          "A beautiful building, no cost to enter. What I want to mention is there are public toilets at the left-front side of the church. They are not marked. Just look for two large wooden doors and people coming in/out. There are two and they are free.",
          "We visited the cathedral and were impressed. We have been in Rome too and I think this place is as nice as Rome",
          "Had never heard of this church and we were very surprised. It is a grand building and the interior is quite beautiful. Our daughter was overwhelmed and took many photos. It counts up there with most of the churches we have visited in Europe. Won a visit f you like churches and",
          "The history of the creation of the cathedral itself is so interesting that would be enough for a visit, but the cathedral itself is astonishing, large altars, huge frescos, works from Goya, great ceilings, it\u00b4s a must see in Zaragoza",
          "Wao this building is awsome. Art in every inch. Beautifull barroque paintings and decorations. It is very big and with different areas. Have to take time to see art and history. A guide tour will be better. Don't forget to visit the elevator behind the Basilica building to",
          "This Basilica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Del Pilar was breathtaking. When we arrived there were services going on, first communions for a few little ones. The legend says that before you walk in you should make a wish (no winning lottery kind of stuff) and if the Virgin Mary Statue that",
          "Almost overwhelming with every surface gilded, carved or painted. Worth taking your time to take it all in. Grab a guide brochure from the Tourismo office across the plaza, as they are not available in the Basilica itself (and everyone kept asking where we got ours). Say Hi to",
          "A stunning church, great architecture, the atmosphere inside is very spiritual, one of the most beautiful churches that l have ever stepped inside, this is a real treasure",
          "It certainly is brilliant from the outside. You just have to remember that this is an active church not a tourist site. You can't take photos, speak or anything else inside. The architecture inside was interesting but I would have been more interested to see what it looked like",
          "We travels by car from Madrid to Barcelona and planned to stop at his midpoint of our 6.5 hour ride. It was a very nice town. We visited this church and were impressed by its beauty. I am pretty sure you cannot take photos inside the church. It was nice to walk around Zaragoza",
          "If you're passing by the area you need to visit this Basilica, best known for its religious significance as well as being one of the recognised treasures of Spain. The Basilica is simply breathtaking, for a regional town it was one of the best churches I visited in Spain. If",
          "This place is so serine,its quiet beauty is undeniable. At night when its light up its magical. The architecture in side and out amazing.",
          "When we visited the place,mass was going on. Priests were available if anybody wanted to do confession. The basilica has a very spiritual rather than touristy atmosphere . The architecture is different with its coloured domes.",
          "Very unique in its architecture - and with the chapel within - I believe the statue of the virgin has its dress changed daily - I have also read that this basilica survived two near misses in the Spanish civil war.",
          "This was one of the finest sites we visited on a 10-day drive across northeastern Spain and southwestern France. It's visible as you enter the city by car and is a wonderful spot for multiple photo ops!",
          "A must see! One of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen. Make sure you go back after the sun goes down. It's absolutely stunning at night.",
          "Everyone MUST see this Basilica in Plaza del Pilar with GOYA museum and sculture of Goya. Impressive opera inside",
          "This is an outstanding edifice, reminiscent of St. Peter's in Rome. So many events going on at once, weddings, and baptisms.",
          "The Basilica has always teased us in the distance as we drove down to southern Spain. when we finally spent some time in Zaragoza it didn't disappoint . I prefer the outside to the inside but that is my personal taste. The inside is beautiful if you like a lot of bling !",
          "Truly spectacular both inside and out. Having visited many Cathedral's and churches over the years this has to rank as one of the best. Quite stunning and for anyone interested in history, art or religion this is going to tick many boxes. There is so much to see that I'm sure",

          "amazing church was always busy the Goya murals are amazing the marble altar was so beautiful would definitely be sure to see",
          "One of the most impressive churches in Spain. The Pilar is massive. We got to visit during Semana Santa and got to see the processions combined later that evening. Spectacular experience!",
          "Zaragoza is an easy day trip from Valencia where we are staying and there is the beautiful church supposedly built on the site where 2000 years ago, St. Jame The Apostle sat while here. The blessed virgin, Mary, has always been the patroness of the Spanish people's according to",
          "This basilica is amazingly gilded, painted and generally over decorated. If you're interested in art and religion it's probably going to tick a lot of boxes. This is a functioning church, so there are services being held in the basilica as you wander through, and a few shrines",
          "The most important thing you can see in Zaragoza. Make sure you take a trip up the tower so you can enjoy the views of the city. It's a great thing to do while in town.",
          "No visit to Zaragoza is complete without a visit to the Pillar to take in its great architectural beauty and history. I make at least one visit every time I am in the city and there is no more beautiful sight than the flowers at Pillar festival in October.",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop.

Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

        "wiki": "Antigua Guatemala (Spanish pronunciation: [an\u02c8ti\u0263wa \u0263wate\u02c8mala]), commonly referred to as just Antigua or la Antigua, is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala known for its preserved Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture as well as a number of ruins of colonial churches. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nAntigua Guatemala serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It also serves as the departmental capital of Sacatep\u00e9quez Department.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe city had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the 1990s. At the time of the 2007 census, the city had 34,685 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAntigua Guatemala means \"Old Guatemala\" and was the third capital of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kakchikel-Maya city, now called Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524\u2014the day of Saint James\u2014and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemalan (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally, St. James became the patron saint of the city.After several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, which is a neighborhood in the municipality of Ciudad Vieja. This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541, by a devastating lahar from the Volc\u00e1n de Agua. As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time five miles away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543, the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala, a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas.\nSantiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, besides modern state of Chiapas in Mexico.  After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n de Agua a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.The city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square.  Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza.  Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general. The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls.  The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called \"Valley of Guatemala\" and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.Due to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565. In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico and the new organization was called Audiencia of Guatemala.The Franciscan friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected.  This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one. The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala: Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are. Notable students included Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando, Thomas Merlo, and Alonso de Paz.\n\nThe first building of a cathedral was begun in 1545 with the debris brought from the destroyed settlement in the valley of Almolonga; however, its construction was hampered by frequent earthquakes throughout the years.  The city was the final resting place of the great Spanish chronicler Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, and his remains were interred in one of the churches that was eventually ruined by earthquakes.\nThe construction of the royal houses for the residence of the Captain General and the members of the Real Audiencia started in 1558; the complex also included the Royal Treasury, jail, Army quarters, the Hall of Arms, and the housing of Audiencia members.In the sixteenth century, there were several important earthquakes on the following dates: \n\nMarch 21, 1530\nSeptember 11, 1541\n1565 (exact date unknown)\n1575 (exact date unknown)\nNovember 30, 1577\nDecember 23, 1585In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain gave it the title of \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\" (\"Very Noble and Very Loyal\").\n\n\n=== 17th-century events ===\n\nThe Jesuits founded the school of \"San Lucas of the Society of Jesus\" in 1608, which became famous and was unrivaled in terms of literature and grammar lessons;  it was attended by the elite nobles of the city society, such as Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the chronicler Francisco V\u00e1zquez, and Pedro Betancourt.  On 18 July 1626, the Jesuit temple was inaugurated; along with the rest of the city, it suffered and was damaged by continuous earthquakes that struck the city between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.The monks of San Juan de Dios founded their hospital and monastery in 1636 and thereafter were in charge of the hospitals in the Kingdom of Guatemala.  Their hospitals were: \n\nSan Alejo: for indigenous people\nSan Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel\nSantiago: for Spanish and mulattos\nSan L\u00e1zaro\nSan Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the Dominicans who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.The temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri.  Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the \"San Francisco de Borja\" where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, S.J., eventually would study and serve as principal.\nIn the seventeenth century there were two types of nuns: discalced and urban.\n\n\n==== Saint Hermano Pedro ====\nPedro de San Jos\u00e9 Betancourt came to Guatemalan land in 1650 from his native Tenerife. Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed.  After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor. Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz's brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas.  He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies.  Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.\n\n\n==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====\n\nFrancisco Marroqu\u00edn, first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for Guatemala, but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroqu\u00edn left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the \"Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino school\"- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as M\u00e9xico City in the New Spain. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, \"Marroqu\u00edn's testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroqu\u00edn never talks about a University, much less establishing one...\" On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the University that \"was being asked of the crown\".The Jesuits opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other regular clergy orders -Mercedarians, Franciscans and Order of Preachers- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues. In August 1655, the Society of Jesus had bought the whole lot from the D\u00edaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees. In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala. The school was the city's most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.After several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, king Carlos II expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala to establish its university or \"General Study.\" After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor Jos\u00e9 de Ba\u00f1os y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the M\u00e9xico University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.\nThe first classes given in the university were:\n\nCanonic law\nMedicine\nScholastic theology\nMoral theology\nLanguagesThe Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the Papal Bull of Pope Innocent XI, issued and dated 18 June 1687.\n\n\n=== 18th-century events ===\n\n\n==== San Miguel Earthquake ====\n\nThe strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717.  At that time, the power of the Catholic Church over the Spanish Empire's citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment.  In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.On August 27 there was a strong eruption of Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, which lasted until August 30;  the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego.  On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel.  Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00 p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock.  The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.The San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed.  There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured. These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity.  City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable.  The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there was additional work done by Porres until 1736.\n\n\n==== San Casimiro earthquake ====\nOn March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more.  The church roof of the Society of Jesus complex fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild.  Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed. In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system.  A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.\n\n\n==== Santa Marta earthquake ====\n\nOn 12 June 1773 Captain General Mart\u00edn de Mayorga was inaugurated, and alongside Cort\u00e9s y Larr\u00e1z and the regular clergy vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.In 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).The Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus.  Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the \"Casa de Ejercicios\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \"Virgin valley\" was authorized.  This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala.  However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.\n\n\n=== 19th-century events ===\n\n\n==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====\n\nAfter the independence of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n and the establishment of a secular government. The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms.As of 1850, Antigua had an estimated population of 9,000. and by 1865, the building was functioning as a vapor activated thread mill, but it was not profitable due to a lack of expert technicians and raw material; and by 1872, the Jesuits were once again expelled from Guatemala by the liberal regime of Justo Rufino Barrios.In 1884 City Hall made an announcement that it intended to transform the old Society of Jesus buildings into a market, in spite of the strong opposition from the neighbors that already had small shops on the plaza.  It was not until 1912 that a market was placed in the complex.\n\n\n=== 20th-century events ===\n\nIn April 1920, during the very last days of Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime, prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited Antigua Guatemala and wrote about his impressions of the city in his book Between two continents. His book is an objective description of the terrible conditions the road and the ruins used to be in: \"For some little way outside Guatemala City it was a fairly decent car ride, but then the roads began developing sand drifts, and later, rockfalls of tumbled stone as two years earlier, the country had been devastated by a powerful earthquake and government corruption made the recovery impossible\".  \"The hills grew steeper and steeper, the jolting more pronounced and the stones even sharper; besides, on top of the road was a two-foot layer of dust which hid the pitfalls but did not detract from their effect\".  \"Along the way, they passed long lines of Indians on their way to Guatemala City, carrying their heavy burdens with apparent ease; men, women and children carried something in the way of a load, and they all carried it quickly. With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons\".After passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died.  After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua.  The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns. Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920, and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions.  In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.But there were other monuments in decent shape: \n\nThe Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing.  The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.\nThe old Capuchin monastery with its many underground passages from the monks' cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.\n\n\n== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==\n\nCentral Park \u2013 Parque Central \u2013 is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (Semana Santa) and Easter (Pascua). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local parishes sponsors a Procession through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions' paths.Due to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHistorically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala. Tourism is the main driver of the economy.  Antigua is also a coffee-producing region of Anacaf\u00e9.\n\n\n== Language schools ==\nAntigua is known as a destination for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for studying the Spanish language by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAntigua GFC football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo, which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed Los panzas verdes (\"Green bellies\") and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThere are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/Chapin breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade tortillas. Throughout Antigua you can find many cuisines from around the world: Mediterranean, Italian, Asian, American, and British pies and French pastries.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAntigua is served by two main hospitals, Hospital Nacional Pedro de Bethancourt and a Guatemalan Institute of Social Security hospital. Emergency medical services are provided by Bomberos Municipales (Guatemala) and Bomberos Voluntarios (Guatemala), who have both previously worked with LFR International to improve prehospital care.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThree large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua. The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the Volc\u00e1n de Agua or \"Volcano of Water\", some 3,766 metres (12,356 ft) high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunap\u00fa (and they still do). However, it became known as Volc\u00e1n de Agua after a lahar from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village San Miguel Escobar.\nTo the west of the city are a pair of peaks, Acatenango, which last erupted in 1972, some 3,976 metres (13,045 ft) high, and the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego or \"Volcano of Fire\", some 3,763 metres (12,346 ft) high. \"Fuego\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities.  It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala.  Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Lanqu\u00edn (Semuc Champey), or Tikal, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City. Antigua is also known for its chocolate makers.\n\n\n=== Spanish Colony monuments ===\n\nBefore it was declared a National Monument by president Jorge Ubico on March 30, 1944, the city ruins were practically abandoned. The following galleries show images of the destruction of the structures due to earthquakes and abandonment. There were other churches, such as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen and the Society of Jesus, that endured the 1773 earthquake relatively well, but they were abandoned and the earthquakes from 1917\u201318 and 1976 destroyed them. In the particular case of de San Francisco El Grande church, it was in good structural condition after the 1773 and 1917 earthquakes, and it was rebuilt in 1967 when the Franciscans returned to Guatemala. This eventually protected the structure from significant damage in the 1976 earthquake. Finally, La Merced church was practically new in 1773, and it has withstood time and earthquakes since; the church was not abandoned in 1776, but it was indeed abandoned in 1829 when the Mercedarians were expelled from Central America by general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, along with the rest of regular clergy and the conservative party members and Aycinena family.\n\n\n=== Holy Week ===\n\nThe most traditional processions are:\n\n\n== In films ==\n\n\n=== The New Adventures of Tarzan (1935) ===\n\nIn 1935, the film The New Adventures of Tarzan, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico.

        "wiki": "Agustina Zaragoza y las Hero\u00ednas or the Monument to Agustina de Arag\u00f3n is an instance of public art in Zaragoza, Spain. Designed by Mariano Benlliure, it consists of a bronze statue of Agustina de Arag\u00f3n topping off a stone pedestal that displays two other sculptural groups and a number of reliefs. The latter subsidiarily pay homage to another six heroines of the Zaragozan theatre of the Peninsular War.\n\n\n== History and description ==\n\nPredated by earlier initiatives to erect a monument to Agustina de Arag\u00f3n tracing back in time at least to 1901, the committee that managed the project awarded the design to Mariano Benlliure in 1907.Cast in bronze at Cescati's foundry in Barcelona, the dashing figure of Agustina de Arag\u00f3n topping off the monument\u2014reportedly inspired in real-life Lucrecia Arana\u2014 is depicted wearing an artillery open front jacket with an epaulette and a shoulder pad, while stepping on a cannon.The front side of the white stone pedestal displays the bronze baturro (Aragonese peasant type) in attitude of crowning the name of \"agustina zaragoza\" in bronze letters on the pedestal with a laurel wreath, while carrying a guitar on his back. The back side of the pedestal features a bronze sculptural group with a Spanish lion (Zaragoza) pawing at an eagle (an allegory of the First French Empire), and an inscription reading \"2 de julio de 1808\" (\"2 July 1808\").Both the lion and eagle and the baturro were cast too at Cescati's foundry in Barcelona. The bronze was provided by the Ministry of War.The front side also presents a relief illustrating the feat of Agustina de Arag\u00f3n using the cannon. Meanwhile, the flanks of the pedestal display bronze reliefs paying homage to the heroines of Zaragoza.The monument was unveiled on 29 October 1908 at its location in the plaza del Portillo, during a ceremony attended by Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie; Antonio Maura (Prime Minister) and Florencio Jardiel (Dean of the Cathedral of Zaragoza) intervened as speakers.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\nBibliographyFiguera, Luis de la (December 1908). \"Centenario de los sitios de Zaragoza\".

However, don't expect to sleep, for example on July 13th 2019 there has been a \"private party\" with incredibly high levels of audio pollution that caused headaches. The security guys tried to talk to the organizers with no success. Party started at 2 pm lasted until after midnight.",
          "A nice campground with large spots and nice facilities. It does however have constant noice from the nearby highway.",
          "The worst campsite on our trip so far. Noisy groups of teenagers running around. Cost 32 euros so pricey for facilities which are used by the public as well. Showers and toilets are relatively clean and the pool is a godsend in the heat but no one to control behavior. Will not be back.",

          "Ok for a one night stay, could be much better if the shower block was maintained better. The site itself is nice, but not within easy walking distance of anything. A car is a must if you want to go & explore or bike if you are able?",

          "MMM, very expensive aire is the way I would describe it. Facilities very tired but usable and hot water hot. Pitch size OK. Trip into Central Zaragoza 1.35 euro each way and 45 mins but well worth the visit. Would we use again, probably as it is conveniently half way to Bilbao.",
          "Average. Electric and water hookup. Large spaces with some shade and not too noisy for a city stopover. You are on the airport flight path so take earplugs. No toilet paper provided and showers were on a timer which hardly gave enough water \u2026",

          "Disappointing is only half of it. The general site looks run down and offers few facilities. Apart from a permanent 'camper' whose pitch is a real disgrace. Would not stop again. Sinks require cleaning and waste bins are all full. Should not take patrons if they do not provide a service. Very disappointing!",

          "TURN BACK, OR DRIVE PAST! Don't be like us ... tired of the drive, heading from La Rioja to the sunny eastcoast with a stopover at Zaragosa Camping. It's the worst value for money. At a camperspot for \u20ac10/24H you get better and cleaner \u2026",

        "wiki": "This article contains cast and character information for the ABS-CBN Philippine action drama television soap opera Minsan Lang Kita Iibigin.\n\n\n== Main cast ==\n\n\n=== Alexander Del Tierro ===\n2nd Lt. Alexander \"Xander\" S. Del Tierro (Coco Martin) He comes from a prominent family with a strong military background. He has a domineering grandfather who is one of the country's feared generals, a manipulative mother solely devoted to pleasing her father, her husband but not her own son, and a father who is a respected military officer and the only one who truly understands him. He has consistently refused to join the military academy, but one major mistake made him decide otherwise. He graduates with honors from the academy; despite this achievement, Alexander feels empty. His duty took him to the mountains and it is there that he began to fill the void in his heart where he finds Javier, his twin brother. He falls in love with a rebel, Kaye who was Javier's former girlfriend, their relationship got easier as she decides to take amnesty and turn her back from her principle.\nIn Season 2, Alexander decides to be based in Manila to become closer to his family, particularly his brother. Upon the decision of the Chief of Staff, he spearheaded the investigation of carnapping incidents and suspects that Javier has been involved, even though he thought right, he failed to prove it from the evidences he has gathered. This leads Javier thinking that his family can revolve around him instead. Alexander experiences Lover's Quarrel with Krista and apologises many times, he soon tries to fix things by asking her to marry him for which Kaye refuses. As his auntie is freed from prison, he sees his affection for his brother and asks her if she could treat him like a son like his brother. Finally after months and trials of proposing to Kaye she reconciles and agrees to marry him. Alexander and his family visits Kaye's house to meet and get to know each other. Meanwhile, he finally confronts his brother of all his wrongdoings, his jealousy and immaturity after he saw his auntie (birth mother) Lora crying after she had a conversation with Javier. As Javier runs away from the police, he and Gabrielle were assigned to work with the police to help capture his brother. Days after he is informed that Javier is roaming around a street near their house. He runs for Javier and ends up getting hit by his brother. He comes back being a whole different person after the attack. In Minsan May Impostor  it is revealed that Javier is impersonating him and the real Alexander is hidden in an abandoned warehouse far from Manila in the forest. Before his twin leaves, Javier took an Iron Mask and wore it on his brother (a parody of The Man in the Iron Mask). Javier visits him again and gives him food, Alexander asks him to set him free but refuses to and tightens the mask and rope he is wearing. Meanwhile, he manages to untie the ropes until Javier comes in and pretends that he hasn't find a way to escape. He later takes the rope off and kick Javier and escapes but is unfortunately hit by Alondra and loses consciousness. Alondra and Javier immediately pulls him back and ties him up and drives away before he wakes up. He later hears Gabrielle and sees her in pain and finds that her best friend has been stabbed. He crawls to her and sees Gabrielle passing away in front of him and cries for help. At night he finds a person dragging Gabrielle's body away, suspecting that it was Javier who really was Mimi but refused to talk. Finally, Alexander finds a way to escape and breaks the padlocks and mask but is still locked inside. Javier visits him and fortunately he wins this fight and retains his name and uniform back and yearns revenge for Gabrielle's death suspecting that it is Javier's fault. He ties Javier up while he is still unconscious and in a reversal of events, he locks Javier up in the cage. He comes back to the military camp and decides not to say anything about Javier's case and that he saw Gabrielle dying in front of him. He runs for Krista and begs her not to leave; he tells her about Javier capturing him after trying so hard not to tell anyone else as it would be dangerous and would be harder to find who killed Gabrielle. He later suspects that his mother Alondra is working with Javier and can be a possible suspect concerning Gabrielle's murder. Alondra's acquaintance with Javier is later proven when he sees his mother and congratulates him for portraying Alexander so well. After finding Gabrielle's body, he checks on Javier and finds that he has escaped but someone has helped him suspecting that it is Alondra, being the only one who has kept connection with him. In Gabrielle's funeral he shares his experiences with her being his best friend and being the one by his side in laughter and sorrow, in sadness and happiness she never left his side and cares more for others and their happiness instead of hers. Alexander shares that Gabrielle is one of the person that gives all her love. That she might not be perfect as a person but is at being a friend and finishes off saying that he loves her and is ready to sacrifice himself for her. With his grandfather being furious, he speaks up and tells what he and Krista has heard concerning Diego, Ibon and Tiago's plans, being the three responsible for the attack causing Remedios' death and is still planning to kill Javier. He also informs that it wasn't him that Gabrielle was following before she died but was Javier and that he impersonated him while he was unconscious and locked up in a cage. Alexander tells them that it was Javier who broke up with Krista and courted Gabrielle and kissed her but is sure that he wasn't part of Gabrielle's death as he is in love with her. He also shares that they've kept Javier in the cage but he has escaped and says that he has only one suspicion on who helped Javier and that is Alondra. After finding out that Mimi and Tomas are related, he brought into conclusion of the possibility that Alondra might've taken him from Lora and that Lora is his real mother, he takes a DNA sample and is meanwhile proven that Lora is in fact his mother. He unites with Lora and promises her that they would never part and would love her as a son, the way Lora never felt and also clears up the questions in his mind of why he never felt Alondra's affection. Alondra blames him for what is happening to her with the people she loves leaving her and that it is all his fault, Alexander tells him that it is her fault and that he stole his life but assures Alondra that he would never insult her because he still respects and loves her but Alondra tells him that she doesn't need his affection. Alexander finds out that Tomas has escaped and is sure that he is going to Lora. With all the military surrounding their house, he orders one of them to check on his mother. They discover that Lora has gone missing and immediately searches for her with the help  Berto. He drops off Berto and goes back to the warehouse where Alondra has kept Lora as of right now. Lora meanwhile escapes and hears a gunshot and finds Javier and a bloody Alondra. He immediately calls for back up and a medical group for Alondra but is hit by Javier but immediately stands up and runs after his brother and asks him to surrender. They find out that the rebels have Alondra and despite all the things she's done to him, he agrees to help her and pretend to be Javier to save her because she is still family. He comes to the building and sees Alondra covered with bombs and fails to rescue her. Alexander apologises to her for failing to stop the bombs from exploding though Alondra asks for forgiveness to him after all these years before she died. A year after, he celebrates his wedding with Krista and are now happy parents of twin brothers.\n\n\n=== Javier Del Tierro ===\nJavier Del Tierro (Coco Martin) \u2013  Towards Season 1 he is introduced as a jolly person. He discovers that he has a twin brother when he encounters Alexander in a fight; even though he's a soldier and Javier is a rebel, he becomes friends with him. He switches with his brother and they both live each other's lives from time to time until Alondra finds them together. While in Alexander's identity, he falls in love with Gabrielle, Alexander's childhood best friend, but she doesn't feel the same way. In an episode, it is revealed that Lora is their real mother but it is yet to be revealed when one owns up and tells the truth between Alondra, Mimi and Tomas.\nIn Season 2, Javier struggles to be part of the society. He finds his sense of belonging with new group of friends, and end up getting involved in car theft business. His role changes as he creates anger towards his brother, sick of being regarded as the lesser and uneducated twin, his friends influence him to ruin his brother's name, he does this by leaking a photo of him hugging Gabrielle for which the military gets involved in. In an episode, he finds out that his friends has been using him all along, he works with the police and Alexander to capture them so that he couldn't end up in jail only getting minor consequences. He tells Kaye that there will be no way of him fixing things up with his brother. As his surrogate mother, Lora takes amnesty he suffers from choosing between his supposed real mother Alondra and his birth mother Lora. After discovering that Javier has done some very bad things, Lora talks to Javier and feels as if she doesn't love him anymore though he continues to visit her. He also develops friendship with Gabrielle until he overhears her conversation with Berto that there will be no chance of her loving Javier. He visits Lora again and hears her and Remedios talking about Alexander and how they think that they have fallen for his kindness. Through this he gets jealous once again and tells Alondra that Lora doesn't love him anymore. He confronts Lora and insults him. He goes with his family to Krista's house for Alexander's planned marriage. Lora asks him to talk to her outside and had their conversation where Javier has completely turned her back on his real mother thinking that he is with his real family. In Minsan Makulong Sa Pag Gustong Tumulong Javier gets imprisoned for allegations of physical assault to Inigo Suarez. He forces his way out of jail but fails to wanting to see his grandmother. Alondra tells him that Lora and Bernabe doesn't care about him anymore, the reason why they're not helping him get out of prison. Remedios visited him in his dreams and promises that he would change when he gets out of prison not knowing that her grandmother is dying. Alondra, Joaquin, Alexander and Jaime takes him out of prison and tells him that Inigo has pulled his case in return of pulling their case concerning their carnapping business. Joaquin tells him that they already had a solid alibi to stop investigating on them. Ka Diego and the others also failed the test telling them if they were using guns from the past 24 hours. As of right now they still need further investigation to suspect who really pulled the trigger. Alondra later breaks into silence and tells Javier that Remedios has died. Inigo visits Javier and jokes around telling him that he killed his grandmother. Javier gets angry and assaults him again. Inigo tells them that they would push through the case against Javier after this. Feeling as if his father, grandfather, Lora has turned his back on him except Alondra who bailed him out of prison after. Javier goes back to the military camp after Lora finding armoury and drugs inside his car. Jaime compares him to Alexander again. Joaquin growls at him and Javier tells him that it wasn't his, Joaquin tells his son that drug possession can't bail him out. He goes back to prison for the second time and has no way out.

        "wiki": "Monasterio de Piedra (Stone Monastery) is a monastery, hotel and park complex in the Iberian System mountain ranges, near Nu\u00e9valos, province of Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. The monastery was founded in 1194 by Alfonso II of Aragon, with thirteen Cistercian monks from Poblet Monastery, in an old castle next to the Piedra River, and was dedicated to St. Mary the White (Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca). On February 16, 1983, the entire complex was declared a national monument.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Monasterio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Piedra (Monastery of our Lady of Stone) is located besides the Piedra (Stone) River. It is undoubtedly one of the most visited places in Aragon because of the many gardens and waterfalls created by the river located in the Piedra (Stone) Canyon. This attraction has become a place of rest and recreation for tourists.\nThe Monasterio de Piedra is in one of the most barren areas of Spain. Its origins date back to 1194, when Alfonso II of Aragon, and his wife Do\u00f1a Sancha donated an old Moorish castle to the monks of Poblet to build a monastery and to establish the Christian faith in the area.\nThe Monasterio de Piedra is in a mountainous region, at around 736 m above sea level in the Iberian System. The traditional access road to the monastery follows the Piedra River, starting from the Nuevalos village. Along the old path are the masonry ruins of a watermill or wheel. This beautiful spot is often used by the Cistercians as inspiration for their work and prayer. The Monasterio de Piedra was founded by Alfonso II in 1194 with monks from Poblet. The work started in 1195 and was completed in 1219. \nThe monastery lies in the confluence of the Ortiz and Piedra Rivers, in a land of thermal springs, such as Alhama and Jaraba. Followers of Islam sought to establish their cities on the rivers banks because their economy was based on agriculture, which was performed through laboring irrigated lands. This is why they chose to live on low lands and did not effectively occupy the higher areas of the Pyrenees, where they merely controlled the traffic of people and goods through fortified steps at the entrance of the valleys. This is also the reason why the noble and Christian clergy, who would be the most likely to suffer because of the arrival of Islam, had to settle on the northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula, where they began to set up churches and monasteries that would sustain those early Christian communities.\nMuslims occupied the existing cities from the Roman Empire and Visigothic civilization, restoring them to a new splendor. This was the case of Huesca, Tarazona, Calahorra and, of course, Zaragoza. In other cases, they founded new cities, such as Tudela, Calatayud, Daroca and Barbastro. This is the case of the Calatayud region, which currently belongs Nuevalos and the Monasterio de Piedra. The area had a large Muslim population which successfully resisted the Christian reconquest several times, as well as attempts of cultural assimilation. The monasteries served, among other things, as centers of evangelization and colonization.\nThe monastery was constructed for defensive strength, with a web of minor fortresses, in an area heavily populated by Muslims. Since the Muslim era, there were abundant irrigation systems, canals, ditches and castles. In 1201, Pope Innocent III issued a papal bull for D. Arnold, successor to the first abbot, confirming possession of property owned by the monastery on its own terms. In 1212 Pope Innocent III issued a papal bull confirming all former possessions. During the reign of Pedro IV the differences between monks and residents in 1335 caused the king to receive the Stone Monastery with their vassals under his tutelage. Subsequently, the pontiffs were granted protection. The monks made several altercations, among which were the passage of merchant caravans of mules, the exploitation of the salt in the municipality of Nuevalos, water use in the villages of the region, dominion over the villages, tithe, etc.\nExcerpts from the Archivo Historico Nacional in Spain in the Aragonese language correspond to a sentence of the second half of the 13th century (between 1260 and 1265). We can see among other things: the origin of the term \"pie\u00e7a\", (piece, part), which currently holds in Llumes village to designate the farms, but is lost in the rest of Aragon; the references to localities are under its current names except for Calatayud which appears as \"Calataiub\". The village now called Llumes is named \"Flumes\" from Flumen, or \"river\" in Latin. The municipalities correspond with the current ones, the limit between Monterde and Llumes is still the road from Cubel to the Monastery, which is the current limit of the Parish of San Miguel.\nOne had to cross the medieval keep to gain entrance through the walls  The church opened into the cloister, noted for its great arches, and the various premises of the monastery. The chapter house (from the early 12th century) was the vital center of monastic life; the monks resided in the main building built in the 17th century. The Romanesque columns of the former abbot's residence support the current Neoclassical one, constructed in the 18th century. In front of the keep are several ancient stones lambing enclosures transformed into hotel rooms, with their corrals landscaped.\nThe monastery was closed down in 1835 during Isabella II of Spain's rule due to the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. The Desamortizaci\u00f3n, or secularization, of the place brought monastic life to an end and the main church was destroyed. The main building has been converted today into a quiet hotel.\nIn February 1836, the Mendizabal Confiscation Ecclesiastical Act declared the sale of all property belonging to the regular clergy, and the proceeds were intended to amortize the debt. The decree was part of a program that sought to win the Carlist Civil War to raise funds and troops to restore confidence in the credit of the State and in the long term, allow for tax reform. Mendizabal, in the preamble, set out other basic objectives of the seizure: clean up the Hacienda and reduce debt, get access to the property of bourgeois sectors, which would improve production and revalue, and create a new social sector related to the system owners and to the side of Queen Cristina.\nSince it was abandoned in 1840, Pablo Muntadas Campeny, a Catalan wealthy merchant, bought the monastery, maintaining farming and livestock in the place. He was surprised by the cool environment in this dry remote rural area.\nHis son, Juan Federico Muntadas, shaped the park by making changes to paths and walkways and planting. Closest to the circuit of the 19th-century Spanish spas, and aware of the responsibility of conserving the landscape and the precarious state of the monastery, Campeny bought the abandoned monastery and its surroundings, and tried several viable businesses. These include a spa, a hotel and a salmon farm. In 1860, after discovering the Iris cave, it was opened to the public. In 1867, he created the first fish farm in Spain, and naturalized brown trout and Iberian crayfish in the waters of the Piedra River. Subsequently, in 1886, the Fisheries Centre of the Monasterio de Piedra was ceded to the Spanish Government. The center continues today to have rivers full of species for reforestation. The result of these activities is the garden that we know today was declared \"Paraje Pintoresco Nacional\" in 1940.\nDon Juan Federico Muntadas, founder and architect of the park, naturalized several salmonid species in the Piedra River. He explored the existing caves, cleaned and opened a path, and brought beautiful tree species, bearing a spa to the condition and use of medicinal waters spas of the era.\nThe church has three naves and its transept is very spoiled, especially the vaults, which fell completely following the abandonment bound by the confiscation. The Monasterio de Piedra is accessed by a medieval wall that stands as the medieval watchtower. The monastery's construction progressed in three architectural stages: Gothic (13th century), Renaissance Gothic (16th century) and Classical-Baroque (18th century).\nThe five apses with the semicircular central are important parts of the head. The western gate is well preserved, despite the shabby facade. It has the looks of a late Romanesque style, with pointed arches and teeth of a saw, much like other Cistercian monasteries.\nThe faculty is decidedly Gothic, with vaults and arches of great simplicity. The Chapter of the Monasterio de Piedra is probably very valuable, especially after its exemplary restoration that has returned all its glory. \nIt has a square. The vaults are ribbed pillars with multiple columns in the center (with traces of original paint) and supports the walls in the form of brackets. It is also has a dramatic faculty room with double lancet arches and pointed eyepiece multitude of elegant columns with vegetable-based \"crochets.\" \nOther preserved units that one should not fail to see are the monks kitchen, the refectory and the Cilla.\n\n\n== Park ==\nThe monastery is located near the Piedra River Canyon, home to many species of birds, damselflies, trout, and endangered fish like the South-west European nase and an endangered species of barbel. The canyon itself includes a network of mossy, garden-like caves (natural and man-made), waterfalls and lagoons that contrast with the otherwise dry hills of southern Aragon. The tallest waterfall is \"Horsetail\" (Cola del Caballo), more than fifty meters high. The dissolution and precipitation of local limestone has created numerous rivulets, springs, and Karst topography. The Piedra River meanders around a mountain known as \"El Espol\u00f3n\" (The Ram). In 1959, a dam was constructed across the river, which created the 1300 acre La Tranquera Reservoir, flooding part of the canyon, some of the best local farmland, and several villages. The roofs of some drowned houses can still be seen when the water levels are down. The reservoir provides domestic water supply, irrigation and electrical energy. The region is a popular tourist destination for hiking, camping, and water sports.\nThe native flora of the area includes oak, pine, holm and kermes oak, interspersed with meadows of lavender (Lavandula stoechas). There are cultivated almond trees, grape vines, and cherry trees. At elevations above 800 meters, the scrub oaks give way to forest vegetation, including maritime and Corsican pines, which have been cultivated throughout the 20th century. At lower elevations, there are also cultivated Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), walnut, horse chestnut, ash, maple, laurel, and cypress trees. Near the water there is a diverse flora, including willows, belfry, reeds (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifoli, Juncus articulatus, Juncus inflexus), grasses (Imperata cylindrica), yellow iris, poplar, tamarisk, plum feral, cherry feral, elms, vines (Clematis vitalba, Vitis vinifera, and ivy), wild roses, wild broom (Osyris alba), dewberries and blackberries.\nMany mammals live in the park, including foxes, beech marten, wild boars, rabbits, deer, badgers and genets, though not in large numbers. Bird species include colonies of vultures, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, hawks, kestrels, owls - especially Scops owls, partridges, quail, doves, larks, robins, and finches. Several European thrush species and the barbary dove are numerous enough to influence the dispersal of plants like Celtis australis, Cynanchum acutum, and bittersweet nightshade. The Tranquera Reservoir and Gallocanta Lagoon create marsh land, which are home to mallards, ducks, pochard, coots, teal, herons and cormorants. Frogs, painted frog, newts, lizards, and various kinds of snakes can be found here as well. The most common fish are trout, catfish and nase, and some areas are stocked with carp and rainbow trout. Local invertebrates include the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, tarantulas and other spiders, butterflies, Brachycera flies, damselflies and dragonflies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Bienes de Inter\u00e9s Cultural in the Province of Zaragoza\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMonasterio de Piedra\nParque Natural del Monasterio de Piedra",

          "We went by coach from Zaragoza, only leaves once a day (9am) and returns at 5pm. It was cold and windy so pack your rucksack properly- we were freezing!! But. The views. The sights. It was absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and once you've paid entry there's no one hassling you to",
          "What a beautiful place to visit on the way from Madrid to Zaragoza. Loved that we were able to take our dogs with us through the park!",

          "The grounds are spectacular and the raptor show is well worth seeing. to maximise your stay I would advise staying at the hotel on the grounds.",
          "One of the better parks I have seen. Well maintained and very very peaceful. The walk around the park easily takes you 3 hours and the variety of scenery is endless. I could spend my entire day there. Highlights are the waterfalls and the caves behind them, but the fisheries",
          "Our visit to Monesterio De Piedra was one of the highlights of our trip to Spain. The absolute highlight was the blue numbered waterfalls walk. If you're physically up for it (steep stairs in a very narrow passageway down) don't miss #17 on the map, behind the waterfall. We",
          "By British standards it is a long way from Zaragoza and we found it hard to believe it was classified as Zaragoza being around 60-80 miles away but we were told by a local that this is normal travel length to get to things in the middle of Spain. Anyway I digress. This place",
          "If you love chocolate, this is a place you must come, the first place where europeans ever tasted chocolate!",
          "A wonderful retreat about an hour and a half drive from Zaragoza close to Calatayud. The old Monestario is fascinating and really well presented with all the featured rooms having descriptions in Spanish English and French. The grounds with their many waterfalls are simply",
          "I took my two teenage daughters and my mother. They loved it! Be prepared, it takes a few hours to get round but you won't want to rush! Good idea to take a picnic.",
          "We planned our trip to Spain in order to make sure we would end up here at some point, and it was well worth it. We rented a car from Barcelona, drove to Zaragoza, spent a day there (beautiful) and the next morning we woke up early and drove straight to the Monasterio de Piedra",
          "We were staying in the attached Hotel, so we got free tickets to go into this park. Apparently it is famous in Spain (noticed it appeared on the large map on the wall of the ferry on the way home) and for good reason. The park features a stunning number of different styles of",
          "Beautiful and refreshing waterfalls in a well maintained natural park with a mixture of paved, gravel and soil paths. There\u00b4s picnic areas although also a cafe if you didn\u00b4t bring food. They have an impressive birds of prey show where you get to meet amazing specimens flying",
          "A wonderful day trip from Zaragoza. Beautiful walks and waterfalls with some fabulous caves. We walk fairly briskly but still spend 2-3 hours walking. Cave part of the walk is not level or easy and is very dark but worth it.",
          "We stayed here as a family group for two nights on a drive further south to the villa that we had rented for part of our holiday. The greeting at reception was lovely and they were very helpful. The rooms were nice, toiletries and good sized towels were provided. Our balcony was",
          "Stunning waterfalls, streams and caves. The temptation to jump in was almost unbearable on a hot day. Kids loved it -- the fascination of water. ...",
          "It is really beautiful nature. Monastery nothing much. I think it is little bit more expansive than it should be, but the nature save my review.",
          "Wonderful place full of waterfalls, gorges, nature... It takes around 2 and a half hours to visit the park. The price to see the Monastery is included in the ticket.",
          "We don't know in Spain how may treasures pending to be discovered, this is for sure one of them. You can always try to find out a Princess behind the waterfall in the best sightseeing of the week.",
          "If you like water falls this is the place for you. The drive is fun for all the switch backs - not for the feint of heart though. We saw maybe 10 cool water falls in 90 minutes. Great and cool caves, a salmon reserve farm where they the monastery still sells fish. All in all, a",
          "Imagine if a bunch of monks had a few centuries to reroute water to create a dynamic example of nature's grandeur in falling water-now add caves, cliffs and fish ponds! Impressive such that words cannot do it justice. Not for the unfit-my phone said I did the equivalent of 32",
          "Such a beautiful place! Lots of waterfalls and a really impressive cave. We went there by bus which took around two and a half hour (10 km) and cost 11 Eur one way. If you are at least three persons I would rather rent a car and drive there myself. With or without the bus trip",
          "It's a fair old drive to this place but for us it was on the way to Madrid. Breathtaking scenery all the way . Once you arrive it's full on waterfalls .. You will get a bit wet.. Great walk around the park next to water under caves and behind waterfalls ... Loved it .. The",
          "It's a bit if a trek but so worth a visit what a beautiful place. There are a few steps but taken at a good pace a lovely walk. Almost magical and so green.",

          "We travelled by coach from Zaragoza - 22 euros each return - excellent value and as seniors the entrance to Monasterio was 11 euros each. It took 2 hours to wander around the Piedra Park with its fabulous waterfalls, grottos and caves, fish pools and conservation areas. The",
          "When we planned our trip, we decided to visit this beautiful place necessarily. It's little bit far away from Madrid - Zaragoza road. In this park there are a lot of small rivers and waterfalls. Every next turn of the route shows you more and more astonishing landscapes. Even",
          "We drove from Zaragoza for a day trip and were sorry we didn't arrange to stay over-night. The park is incredible; the waterfalls so beautiful - almost unreal. We followed the path and at every turn, it seemed we were more blown away.",
          "We visited at easter and loved all the waterfalls and the birds of prey. I don't know what it would be like after a dry summer but when we went there was an abundance of water.",
          "So so beautiful. Magic around every corner. Immense beauty. We'll sign posted and good services. Don't miss the birds of prey and make the effort to walk all the way in to the valley.",
          "we were looking forward to visiting bu had no idea how crowded and expensive it would be be. Perhaps on a weekday it would be more tempting...",
          "Though the monetary on the grounds is interesting, the park itself is the knock-out. Walking the provided circuit takes you through fields, caves, marshlands, and rugged hillsides, as well as behind waterfalls and past picturesque lakes. A real voyage of discovery.",
          "A really beautiful scenic drive there and then the walk has so many amazing waterfalls that it takes you forever to get around because you want to stop every few meters for pictures. The monastery is just beautiful also, very calm and serene. There is also a spot to take a pic",
          "This place was recommended to us and while driving from Madrid to Zaragoza we stopped off \u20ac15.50 entrance fee but don't be put off worth every penny,we spend 2 hours here in this paradise, the weather was good which helps, this involves a bit of climbing (steps) but is worth it",
          "It's one of the most beautiful places in Arag\u00f3n. Before getting there the area is dry with little vegetation. But once you get to the park everything changes. There are birds, waterfalls, lakes... A small peaceful heaven in Spain. The monastery visit isn't that interesting, but",
          "Great place to see beautiful panoramas of tall trees, grass, waterfalls, river, cliffs, birds especially when in exhibition. We've also taken our grandkids and they had fun too. Maybe one of the most beautiful parks in Spain. We've gone in the 4 different seasons of the year and",
          "So beautiful, great water falls, a great 2 hour walking tour. Photos uploaded do not really show its beauty. Did not know there was something 2 hours away from Madrid so amazing and breath taking!!!",
          "This place is total Zen! About 15 of us decided to take trip to the enchanted place. There is a lot of walking but totally worth it. Most of the different types of waterfalls are breathtaking. The nature and the scenery will put relax you beyond believe. Would definitely",
          "We had driven for most of the day in our camper van to reach here, and arrived from the south down the very narrow road through the gorge. We visited the park in the morning, before the coach parties arrived, thankfully. The ticket office was not clearly signposted and we spent",
          "Amazing surprise at end of a long drive. This park is truly spectacular, be aware not many sighs on the road we wore worried that will found only the Monastery. Even when you arrive go to the ticket box its 15\u20ac to enter. We wore very sceptical as no one spoke English if we had",
          "This place has some of the most amazing walks!! They are not for the faint hearted though! You walk up cliff faces and through caves and even behind waterfalls! In the spring there are hundreds of irises which are stunning. This has to be in your agenda if you are in the area",
          "If I had to choose between a free trip to Disneyland and going back to the Monasterio de Piedra, I would choose the monastery. The waterfalls are absolutely stunning and the lakes are so clear it looks like the salmon are flying rather than swimming. Truly an unforgettable",
          "This is an amazing place to visit with beautiful parkland leading to an array of spectacular waterfalls. The monastery museum itself is also worth a visit and shows how wine was made over the centuries.",
          "The park that surrounds the monetary is a spectacular network of beautiful paths, tunnels, waterfalls and peaceful gardens defending into the canyon's fish farms. Highly recommended!",
          "Monasterio de Piedra is truly one of Spain's top natural attractions a little off the beaten track,half way between Pamplona and Madrid, but worth the detour. Beautiful waterfalls and ponds along the 2 to 3 hour walk. The monastery is interesting and the restaurant is ok. Well",
          "I can't recommend this place highly enough, if you're anywhere close make the detour and spend half a day walking around this gorgeous park, you won't regret it.",
          "Excelent place with lot of water falls. Extremly good indications and very helpful map. I will recommend that one should visit it at least once in his life.",
          "The place is far away for one day trip from Zaragoza. A bit expensive (15E) for spanish standarts. I did not like the dysneyland - like atmosphere in this place full of people.",
          "I liked the place, very beautiful nature, the waterfalls are outstanding. It is definitely worth visiting.",
          "One word: Beautiful. Stepping in the waterfall's cave is an amazing experience. I'd definitely go back with family and friends.",
          "The monastery itself is very interesting although nothing particularly exceptional. First place that chocolate was ever made in Europe - who knew? The gardens though are something else. If you love waterfalls, this is paradise. But be warned there are hundreds if not thousands",
          "An awesome find enroute to Zaragoza. Beautiful grounds with wonderful trails and amzing waterfalls. The chocolate and wine museums are not worth much time.",
          "Incredibly beautiful! So beautiful, clean, tourist-orientated, full of people, square that...it's difficult to believe that it's 100% natural. Definately worth seeing!",
          "Visted on a school trip in the 70's ,during a part of my childhood spent living in spain Plan to go back !! and also relax in the spa this time !! although some reviews comment on how far it is from varaious locations ,spain is quite vast country so if your visting areas north",
          "Absolutely stunning park; waterfalls, cascades, cool glades, trout ponds, places to sit and drink in the views! Don't miss it!",
          "Well worth trip out of the hot dusty city to the green, peaceful oasis - and surrounded by vineyards.",
          "It is quite a drive to get to here but it's a scenic route once you get off the autovia. It is a little over an hour from the city of Pamplona. It is \u20ac15 per adult for entry. It is very simple to navigate as it is a case of following the blue arrows and then the red arrows to",
          "This spot shows as #2 attraction in Zaragoza for a good reason. It's absolutely spectacular. The monastery is impresive as well being so old, but for us the real attraction was the park. It takes about 2 hours to get to the Park from Zaragoza Delicias train station and it",
          "Amazing, so beautiful, highly recomended in autumn to enjoy the tree colours and to avoid the summer heat, though in a place like this it\u00b4s not as hot as Zaragoza....a romantic place for couples where u can take unforgettable potos and also for families....u will get surprised",
          "It is not far from Zaragoza but still you need to know where it is as it is really in the middle of nowhere. You may be surprised as it is like a hidden gem. Very nice place to visit with family and lot of beautiful nature around.",
          "An amazing place in the middle of nowhere! It can take a long time to get into the monastery itself and once in, we didn't wait for a guided tour as we were nearing the end of the day so didn't have much time. As a result, we probably missed out on all the interesting details",
          "If you line nature full of cement this is your place. However if you like places were balance nature and people activities you can be quite dissapointed with this park. The park is focus on how many people can visit it rather than developed balance among human activities and",
          "Incredible place, it is a must to visit if planning to be anywhere near it, even if you have to drive 100km ! One of the most gorgeous places I have ever visited.",
          "It was so cool to learn the history of this place - especially that this was the site where chocolate was first introduced to Europe! And the natural park is gorgeous; the trails take you by waterfalls, through caves, and around lush vegetation.",
          "You must see it when you are visiting Zaragoza. Nice way to the park It's cost 15\u20ac but that a little to much ! Great free parking. You must can walk very good because it is a very heavy way. So, not for people with walking problems.",
          "From Zaragoza, this is quite a long way away. Granted. Read on. If you can spare a whole day, you simply must go to this marvellous place. Exceptionally well preserved Cistercian monastery, with a brace of cracking displays inside. The main attraction has to be the park.",
          "We visited the day before Good Friday - the whole place was entirely packed with other people, the only downside - my advice is try and not visit on a public holiday. An easy drive from Zaragoza - just about an hour - we explored the monastery in the morning and the grounds in",
          "I had read about the Piedro Monastery in a Paul Coelho book and so when we drove through Spain it was on my list. I was not prepared for the extreme richness of color and depth to the area of Spain. I can only describe the entire area as fresh. The cedar and smell of rain on",
          "I saw this when we were planning our mini road trip around Spain and knew I would love it. Boy o boy I was not disappointed. I can't even begin to explain how blown away I was by everything in the park. It's tucked away in the middle of nowhere but is an absolute gem and must",
          "We visited it in September, when it was still extremely hot in Aragon. I needed to run away from the city, from the heat, but also from the typical Aragonian brown, sunburnt countryside. It was a perfect choice! The Monasterio itself is an interesting place, even for those who",
          "We were staying in Zaragoza, but we had a rental car. We drove here, and although the trip is a little long, it was worth it. Beautiful hands on monestary, and the park is amazing. The waterfalls and landscape entertained our children for hours. I would plan minimum 2 hours",
          "Very famous place in Zaragoza (Spain),with many waterfalls,forest and mirror lake. Close to the park there is a restaurant and you can taste the tipical fish....trout.",
          "I found this attraction as the top in Zaragoza. But the most funny is,that this attraction is more than 100km away from Zaragoza. We stopped there on our way from Zaragoza to Madrid. Yes,there is a lot of lovely waterfalls, trees,birds atc. But it is a park.If you are a romantic",
          "Our friends have gone here twice and they told us we just had to go. They even took over our work shift so we could go. It was incredible and lived up to the expectations based on our friend's comments. Like everyone else has said...there's water everywhere. The park is well",
          "the actual park is great to see!!! loads of waterfalls and a very nice trial to trek with your partner. Lots of spots were to take pictures! You can also note birds of prey hovering above all the time! It is very easy to follow the paths from the signs and the map! You just",
          "Let's be clear off the bat: I absolutely love waterfalls. So it comes to no surprise I was beyond myself exploring the natural man-tammed wonders of this park. When I started the hike, I had no idea I was going to be surprised at every corner by yet another amazing waterfall. It",
          "A great get away off the tourist track. This wasn't even in our guide books. Beautiful waterfalls, breath-catching cliffs and views, and a walk through a cave, all on a moderate to easy path. Just what we needed to restore and renew ourselves. We brought along our dog and",
          "We took the bus from Zaragoza at 9am and left at 5pm. We thought it would be too long but were stunned when we walked through the park. It was amazing. Waterfalls and streams everywhere with stairs, caves, tunnels and trout ponds. We loved it. The ruins of the Monastery were",
          "You\u00b4ll never imagine a place like that is hidden between those mountains!!! MUST SEE!!!! And take your Camera with you!!! 15 euros all day!!!!",
          "I just love such places - nature - amazing waterfalls, caves and views.. If you are at Zaragoza or close to it, worth going this far and visit this one. Not suitable for small kid carriages though.",
          "A beautiful walk through a park with a lot of waterfalls. We did the 'big' round of approx 90 minutes. During your walk you walk behind waterfalls and through some kinds of caves.",
          "Very recommended for everyone (families, couples, kids and etc.). No special equipment needed. Car parking is free and lots of it. We visited the park, did not go to monastery. Whole trip took about 2 hours. Waterfalls, eagles, trouts and mountains - everything in one place. You",
          "Went with our kids (16-23) early July, but still had plenty of water and the waterfalls were incredible. They have a nice bird show (in spanish at 1pm and 5pm). the visit to the monastery isn\u00b4t that great, it\u00b4s mostly ruins. They have a restaurant at the hotel and another",
          "A wonderful garden. It takes about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to walk through it. It is very beautiful with waterfalls, large trees, fish ponds and mountains.",
          "It's an amazingly beautiful place to visit !! The place where you can see an old architecture and the beauty of the nature... Firstly, you may visit an old Cistercian monastery and feel the long history of that place and country itself. Secondly, the park where you'll see",
          "This place is worth seeing! So green and nice and impressive! Make sure to make the whole walk - really worth the small effort!",
          "this has been covered by a lot of dfferent people,i agree getting there is a bit of a pain but feel worth the effort many things in the park lakes waterfalls streams.spend a few hours with nature felt the monastery does not offer very much.",
          "We'd marked this as a possible day trip before our 4 day Zaragoza break, leaving a definite decision till we got there. After our first day we decided we'd go for it although getting there proved to be a bit of a mission. The bus leaves from the main bus station, quite a way",
          "We took the bus from Zaragoza bus station at 9am and returned on the bus at 5pm, the bus ride was an enjoyable journey. Definitely worth a visit. We spent the whole day walking amongst lakes, waterfalls and forest, then finished the day with a very nice meal at the park",
          "My two favorite things in nature- waterfalls and mountains. This park has both. at least an hour walk just to see all the waterfalls, going through caves etc. Awesome!!! A must see place when in the area. The second part of the park- the reflection lake with the big boulder in",
          "We stayed at the hotel which granted us access to the park. After we had breakfast (at the hotel, which was delicious!) we headed right to the park. This was at about 11:30am and it was peaceful, not very busy at all. I was in awe the whole time. The waterfalls, the crystal",
          "Beautiful - just beautiful. We got there after lunch on May 1st - big mistake! We queued to get in and then queued for even longer for part of the walk where you go behind a waterfall. My tip would be to stay at the hotel in the grounds and be in the park really early to savour",
          "We stayed at the hotel and got into the park early when nobody else was around. Highly recommended as it gets busy later and the wonderful scenery is best seen in the quiet. Highlight is the large waterfall with many steps to the grotto behind. Then lovely sights at the lakes",
          "Worth the time to visit. Nature shows off in here, and it is an amazing place to walk around, with the waterfalls, the paths, the fisheries, the park. Wear your walking shoes and burn some calories while you view the beauty.",
          "okay, so to be direct : entrance fees: 15euros and it worth; the cascades are magic ...so natural and so nice; think to wear sneakers because you have to walk on a mountain and also a coat when visting the place during May and before because it's mucho friooooo for meals, try",
          "I will never forget this experience and I would hope to go back some day and experience it all over again. Stepping down those stairs into a cave with my nephew who was about 4 years of age must have been the most frightening experience as I was worried for him. Although, he had",
          "This is a park and a monastery building next to each other. The building is fine, but nothing exceptional. But the park is beautiful has splendid views and waterfalls. It is not just another average park. It involves some walking and stairs so you need to be in a reasonable",
          "I read about Monasterio on TripAdvisor. We came from Zaragoza to Monasterio. It turned out to be an excellent decision. Beautiful scenery, beautiful park and waterfalls. Nicely spent the morning in a beautiful setting.",
          "A place at open air, beautiful, cristal clear water running its river, a monastery to discover, you can have a rest or spend overnight.",
          "This is a kind of \"theme park\" based of natural beauties. It has very nice waterfalls, lakes and my favorites: the caves under the waterfalls. You can spend there the whole day, walking and enjoying the nature. The ticket is expensive for a natural park, but I think it's worth",
          "The park itself was very cool, we went in the winter and so we didn't get a chance to see anything in bloom but the waterfalls were pretty impressive",
          "Visit to both the park and monastery takes at least three hours and the time is well spent. There is a short route through the park but I suggest to take the longer one including the cave with the horse-tail waterfall.",
          "I liked it so much. It would be better if you visit during spring or autumn. The entrace ticket is a bit expensive considering that it is not an amusement park with many facilities. Please try your lunch at the restaurant of the hotel nearby as the other normal restaurant is",
          "The place is great, it was helped by the splendid weather. The place is quite small, it takes around an hour and a half if you take your time. Definitely a must-go for some relaxing time.",
          "This is maybe one of the most spiritual, relaxing, and confortable places on earth, so much beautity and so well preserve is hard ti find, so if you visit Aragon province you must visit monasterio de piedra park",
          "I liked everything (a great place to visit, especially when it is hot!). The only problem may be to get there if you do not have a car, as the bus goes one time a day only some days a week. We took a taxi and all was great!",
          "We stayed at the hotel for a night and took the breakfast included package. The park's entrance fee is waived for hotel guests. the value overall was fantastic. The grounds of the park were immaculate, we recommend staying overnight because you can be the earliest guests and",
          "We rented a car and drove to Calatayud(approx. 1.5 hours from Zaragoza). The National Park where the Monastery is located is beautiful with water falls big and small. Very picturesque....cost 15 Euros per person. Takes at least 2 hours of hiking a designated trail to see.",
          "only for nature lovers, peace seekers, stressless beings, water enthusiasts and the rest of us who would love our world to be simpler, easier, quieter, unspoiled, pure... if you are one of these fellas or feel like wanting to be one of us, you're wasting your time reading this,",
          "Great place to visit. Beautiful rainfalls, nice trails, very romantic\u2026 It worth the visit. Spend at least 3-4 hours, and enjoy!",
          "I found this to be one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. Waterfalls, caves, lakes with clear water, rocks and rivers, you're surrounded by so much beauty at Monasterio de Piedra that it feels almost unreal. I would recommend it to any outdoor loving person.",
          "We called in for a couple of hours on our way to Madrid. The park is lovely, the waterfalls are very pretty but some of them do look man made rather than natural. There wasn't anyone to ask if this was the case, although the walk in the tunnel under the biggest waterfall was",
          "We visited as part of a long weekend in Zaragoza. If you don't have personal transport, there is a 9.00am departure from the bus station which get you gets you back about 7.30pm. The park itself is beautifully maintained. The walk through the waterfalls is a stunning way to",
          "The tourism office will recommend this place to everyone and the locals adore it. That's why, if you go, be prepared to find it overrun with families. There are dozens of places in Aragon which are just as, if not much more beautiful than this park which has man-made causeways",
          "Well worth visiting if you are in the area or are visiting the Zaragoza area by car. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour of the monastery, and the park was fantastic. However, entry was 15 euro and I really couldn't understand why it was so expensive but then I found out, as the",
          "We spent one of our days in Zaragoza (the city) driving to the monastery, which was about an hour away. We had GPS, but it is well-marked when you get close. The monastery is pretty fascinating and if you ask for some info in English, they will give you a sheet which provides",
          "Just clean and stunning, lots of great bars and restaurants and water falls. Lovely city. Lots to visit and expletive watching is fascinating",
          "I am a lover of nature, grass ,green and water so I had to see this fantastic place during my little trip to zaragoza. It was worth the money and the time. It is located at 112 km distance from the city.You can reach this place by bus, taken from The Central Bus and Train",
          "You can enjoy the sound of the spring falls, walk through interesting caves, get impressed by the mirror lake.",
          "Hidden jewel. It is like taken out of a lord of the rings book. A little pricey but well worth it. Make sure you bring your hiking shoes, lots of narrow stairs that take you into caves.",
          "The gardens are amazing, I have never seen so many waterfalls in a short walking distance. Wear good shoes!",
          "So if you've found this place, well done. It really is in the middle of nowhere, and after a long and winding drive, accompanied by loads of vultures( or maybe buzzards), circling high in the blistering blue sky, you eventually arrive in this oasis of green. After miles of dry",
          "A s.XII monastery with a very well organized guided tours. It takes around 2h to visit the whole park and, even we did not have much time, we decided to visit it all. We were were gladly surprised with every single lake and cascade, so I suggest you visit the whole blue route.",
          "Stayed for two nights at the monastery which gave us the early half of Saturday to enjoy the waterfalls and walks before they got so crowded. This is a popular destination. Loved our rooms, had great meals and a really good breakfast buffet; this is the kind of place lots of",
          "One of the most beautiful drives up and up to the very top of the mountain. This is a must see and completely worthy destination. The first kings of Spain are buried here, the old monastery is an amazing site to see. The new one destroyed by Napoleon is equally worth it. I",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population.

Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar.

        "wiki": "The Buenos Aires Underground (Spanish: Subterr\u00e1neo de Buenos Aires), locally known as Subte (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8su\u03b2te], from subterr\u00e1neo \u2013 'underground' or 'subterranean'), is a rapid transit system that serves the area of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first section of this network (Plaza de Mayo-Plaza Miserere) opened in 1913, making it the 13th subway in the world, and first underground railway in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Spanish-speaking world, with the Madrid Metro opening five years later, in 1919. As of 2015, Buenos Aires is the only Argentine city with a metro system, but there is a proposal to build a metro in the city of C\u00f3rdoba (the C\u00f3rdoba Metro), while a proposal to build a metro in Rosario was shelved in favour of a tramway network.Currently, the underground network's six lines\u2014A, B, C, D, E, and H\u2014comprise 56.7 kilometers (35.2 mi) of route that serve 87 stations. The network is complemented by the 7.4 km (4.6 mi) long Premetro line, and the 26 km (16 mi) long Urquiza suburban line, with 17 more stations in total. Traffic on lines moves on the left, because at the moment of system's open Argentina drove on the left. As of 2015, the underground also has 4 closed stations, and lines E and H are undergoing expansions. Over a million passengers use the network, which also provides connections with the city's extensive commuter rail and bus rapid transport networks.\nThe network expanded rapidly during the early decades of the 20th century; by 1944 its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s expansion resumed at a quicker pace, and four new lines were planned for the network. Despite this, the network's expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 new lines, F, G and I; and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the I line is postponed for future expansion, plus several other route amendments.\nThe entire network was nationalised in 1939, remaining in state hands and operation until the mid-1990s when it entered into a concession model. The previously state-operated lines were offered as 20-year concessions to interested private parties; the two complementary lines were also included in this privatisation and all have been operated by Metrov\u00edas since 1995, though the network and rolling stock remain the property of the City of Buenos Aires.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Subte opened in 1913, becoming the 13th underground system in the world, as well as the first in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Hispanophone world, followed by the Madrid Metro in 1919. The network was originally built and operated by three separate private companies and later nationalised in 1939. In 1952 it was absorbed by a unified state administration, in 1963 it became the property of a newly founded company, which changed hands in 1979. The Subte then entered into a concession model in the mid-1990s through which private sector parties were to submit bids to execute investment plans \"designed and funded\" by the state, while implemented by the concessionaire. All the Underground lines, along with the Urquiza Line and Premetro were offered as 20-year concessions to interested private parties. By 1995, Metrov\u00edas took over the Subte under a $395 million plan.\n\n\n=== Early days ===\n\nDiscussions on the need to build an underground transportation system in Buenos Aires began in the late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, which was one of the most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis exacerbated by the monopolisation of the lines, which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.In this context, the first proposals for the building of an underground system were made, along with requests for government grants: first, in 1886, and several more in 1889. However, the Ministry of Interior (Ministerio del Interior, in Spanish) denied the city administration the power to license building in the city's subsoil and for this reason, subsequent drafts were submitted directly to this ministry. In 1894, when it was decided to construct the Congress building in its present location, the underground idea was revived, since it would shorten the travel time between the Casa Rosada and the Congress. In 1896 Miguel Can\u00e9, former Mayor of Buenos Aires (1892\u20131893), expressed the need to build an underground railway similar to the one in LondonThere were numerous proposals at the time to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6-metre-high (20 ft) steel and iron posts positioned in 10-to-15-metre (33 to 49 ft) intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build, and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.The first Underground line was opened on 1 December 1913 and was built by the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company (AATC), which had been given permission to build in 1909. That line was made up of one of the existing sections of Line A, linking the stations of Plaza de Mayo and Plaza Miserere. 170,000 passengers took part in the line's first trip. On 1 April 1914 the line was to expand to R\u00edo de Janeiro station and on 1 July was extended to Primera Junta Station.In 1912 the Lacroze Hermanos company won a concession to build another Underground line. The company was a competitor to the Anglo-Argentine company, operating tramways in Buenos Aires as well as the Buenos Aires Central Railway, which later became part of the Urquiza Line. Construction began in 1927 and this line became Line B when it was inaugurated on 17 October 1930. During 17\u201318 December 380,000 passengers travelled on the line's then 32 cars. The line was originally intended to continue above ground, with the current Federico Lacroze station to be the central terminal of the Buenos Aires Central Railway (today the General Urquiza Railway), however nowadays the overground service forms part of the Urquiza Line instead.By the 1920s, the Argentine government was dissatisfied with the lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made in expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constituci\u00f3n and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compa\u00f1\u00eda Hispano\u2013Argentina de Obras P\u00fablicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constituci\u00f3n railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agust\u00edn P. Justo, then President of Argentina.CHADOPyF opened Line D in 1937, from Catedral through Tribunales; with Line E following later in 1944, from Constituci\u00f3n to San Juan y Urquiza, later joining with Boedo station. By this point the advent of the Second World War had slowed expansion significantly, but the network was 29 km (18 mi) in length with each of the three companies \u2013 unusually for an underground network \u2013 continuing to run their respective lines, which were financed entirely with private capital, unlike the country's railways which had been largely dependent on subsidies.\n\n\n=== Nationalisation ===\n\nThe entire network was centralised and nationalised in 1939 under the management of the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) and the lines were given their current lettered naming scheme, from A to D in the order in which the lines were opened. In 1952 the CTCBA was absorbed by the Buenos Aires Transport General Administration (AGTBA) and in 1963, the administration was dissolved and the Underground network became the property of the Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires company (SBA).In the early years of nationalisation, interchanges were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.Four different long-term expansion proposals were put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous lines to the network as well as extending the existing ones. Given the political instability characteristic of Argentina during this time, none of these proposals came to fruition, though aspects of them have been incorporated into contemporary expansion plans. One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city's commuter rail lines through tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires Underground, and while this was also shelved, it has been adapted into the current Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.During the 1960s and 70s, efforts were primarily concentrated on Line E, which was re-routed from its terminus at Constituci\u00f3n to the centre of the city at the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to boost passenger figures, something which proved to be successful. The segment was opened by president Arturo Illia in 1966 and Spain offered CAF-General El\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola trains in order to cancel part of the debt it had accrued with Argentina; trains which continue to serve on the line today. The line was extended westward to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moreno in 1973, in what would be the only expansion of the decade.\nIn 1979, SBA became Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires Sociedad del Estado (SBASE) under Buenos Aires mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore of the National Reorganisation Process military junta. After a long period of stagnation, the Underground began to be expanded again with Lines B and E within the scope of these plans, though only the extension of Line E was commenced and completed before the transition to democracy where expansion was once again stalled. During this time, four Premetro feeder lines were planned leading out from the western termini of Lines D and E as well as one in Puerto Madero, however only Line E2 was completed in 1987 and these plans were scrapped in 1994 when operation of the Underground changed hands.\n\n\n=== Privatisation ===\n\nIn 1994 the operation of the network was privatised, along with the country's railways, and is now managed by Metrov\u00edas. SBASE (as part of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires) maintained ownership the network, its rolling stock and infrastructure, and administers its expansion and budget. One cosmetic change carried out in the 1990s under private operation was the re-assignation of the colours of the lines, with Lines B and D switching colours, Line C changing from purple to blue and Line E changing from yellow to purple. The change of colours was also accompanied by a standardisation of the network's signage to match the new schemes.In 2012, the role of Metrov\u00edas was lessened to simply operating the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri's mayoral administration and Metrov\u00edas became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. The relationship was further strained in 2013 when Metrov\u00edas' 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving the door open for a state-run or mixed operation. Among the public, privatisation has proved unpopular, with a survey carried out in 2015 indicating that 82% of passengers would like the Underground to be operated by the state instead of a private company.In more recent years, Line A and Line B have been extended westwards, adding a total of 4 stations to each line between 2003 and 2013. During the same period, Line H was opened 2007, making it the first completely new line on the underground since Line E, excluding the Premetro. There have also been significant modernisations of infrastructure, signalling systems, stations and the network's rolling stock.The current contract expires on 31 December 2019 with bids being prepared by:\nKeolis in partnership with Transport for London and Eduardo Eurnekian's Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica\nMetrov\u00edas in partnership with Deutsche Bahn\nRATP Group\n\n\n== Network and services ==\nThe network comprises six underground lines, labelled \"A\" to \"E\" and \"H\" and which are further identified by different colours, covering a total route length of 56.7 kilometers (35.2 mi) and serving 87 stations. There is also one surface 7.4-kilometer (4.6 mi) Premetro line with an additional 17 stations. Daily ridership was approximately 1.11 million in 2015. With the current usage patterns, the entire system is overstretched, and during weekdays overcrowded and with insufficient services. An expansion programme is underway, and it is expected to enlarge the network to 97 kilometers (60 mi) in the future. Similarly, new rolling stock has been incorporated across lines since 2013 to improve capacity and the last of the current orders are set to arrive in 2016 and followed by further orders of new rolling stock, which is expected to increase ridership figures to 1.8 million by 2019.\n\n\n=== Fares and operating times ===\n\nFares are AR$19.00 flat per trip on the Subte, though these can be as low as AR$11.40as 41st or more per trip depending on how many trips are made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$7.00., as the fare have been increased multiple time due to devalue of Argentine Peso. While tokens have been used in the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3\u20134 minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6 minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.Trains originally ran until 01:00, but following the privatisation of the service through concession to Metrov\u00edas, the company established an earlier closing time of 23:00 in 1994 to carry out works on the lines; this change was only meant to be temporary, but was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions as well as a campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 on weekdays and 3:00 on Fridays and Saturdays. These proposals have been rejected by Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced schedule is needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.The subte operations are radio-controlled and monitored remotely from the Metrov\u00edas Central Operations Post (PCO in Spanish). In it, 24 operators have been monitoring four of the six subway lines (lines C and H have separate monitoring) since 2001. As of 2015, last formations arrive at their respective terminals at approximately 11:30pm, where maintenance and cleaning operations take place until about 04:00am.\n\n\n=== Premetro ===\n\nThe PreMetro line E2 is a 7.4-kilometer (4.6 mi) tramway feeding Line E. The Premetro line opened in 1987. It carries approximately 2,300 passengers daily and is also run by Metrov\u00edas. In 2015, SBASE began making plans to refurbish and rebuild many of the stations, including a brand new central terminal, as part of a plan to modernise the network, which also intends to increase the amount of rolling stock in circulation. By the end of 2015, the Intendente Saguier terminal had been refurbished, though other works on the line were delayed.The Premetro was originally intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, the role of the network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.\n\n\n=== Urquiza Line ===\n\nL\u00ednea Urquiza (in English: Urquiza Line) is a 26-kilometer (16 mi) suburban electric commuter rail line originally designed to be part of the Underground system as part of Line B, and operated by the Underground operator Metrov\u00edas. As a result, it has similar characteristics to Line B, using third rail electrification and standard gauge as opposed to the broad gauge used in the Buenos Aires commuter rail network. It runs from the Federico Lacroze terminus in the barrio of Chacarita, to General Lemos terminus, Campo de Mayo in Greater Buenos Aires. The line is completely at grade (ground-level) and uses third rail current collection. It operates 20 hours a day, 7 days a week at 8-to-30-minute intervals. The Urquiza Line transported 15 million passengers in 2013.Originally the line was planned to run into the centre of Buenos Aires through a long tunnel. But when the tunnel was finally built in 1930, it ended up as the Line B. The access ramp still exists and is in use today, but for maintenance and storage purposes rather than for passenger services. The Urquiza Line itself opened in 1948, so suburban passengers travelling on the Underground's Line B have to transfer to the Urquiza Line at Federico Lacroze station, named after its builder, about 6 km (3.7 mi) from the city centre.\n\n\n== Stations and connections ==\n\nStations are listed from East to West or North to South. Stations in gray have yet to open. Stations in bold are the current termini. Small interchange icons indicate interchanges under construction\n\n\n=== Ghost stations ===\n\nThere are four ghost stations on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations \u2013 Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte \u2013 were closed in 1953 since stations in that part of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.The Line E stations were closed in 1966, after the line was re-routed from Constituci\u00f3n railway station (where it connected with Line C) closer to the centre of the city, leaving the San Jos\u00e9 vieja and Constituci\u00f3n stations out of the network, a move which tripled traffic on the line. The two stations have been used as workshops and storage areas in the past.At one point it was considered that the two former Line E stations and tunnels should be used for Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.\n\n\n== Expansion plans ==\nThroughout the past, there have been several plans to expand the Underground system as a whole. The underground's routes are said to spread out like \"branches of a tree\" from the Plaza de Mayo, something Miguel Delibes described as \"restrictive\". Current expansion efforts attempt to address those restrictions by creating more north\u2013south lines and moving termini away from the city centre. The current expansion plan was approved in the year 2000 under Law 670 and has seen the creation of Line H, as well as the extensions of Line A and Line B westwards. However, in 2015 an alternative plan has been proposed which would make numerous amendments to the Law 670 plan.\n\n\n=== Works in progress ===\n\n Line H's extensions to the north from Corrientes to Plaza Francia, serving intermediate stations at C\u00f3rdoba, Santa Fe and Las Heras, and south from Hospitales with stations at Nueva Pompeya and S\u00e1enz, were initiated with ground-breaking ceremonies on 17 January 2012. Since then, following concerns that the construction of Plaza Francia station would damage the natural beauty of the area surrounding the Recoleta Cemetery, the station was relocated to Facultad de Derecho next to the University of Buenos Aires's faculty of law, with the change delaying the opening of the station until 2018. Cordoba and Las Heras were opened in December 2015, while Santa Fe opened in mid-2016, providing the line with a connection to Line D. The 20 new Alstom trains to serve the expected increase in passenger numbers as a result of the connection with Line D began arriving in the country in 2015.\n\n\n=== Planned lines ===\n\nThe future expansion outlined in Law 670 sees the addition of three new lines. These lines' routes have already been approved by the Legislature of the City in Law 670. 39.3 km will be added to the network, expanding it to about 97 km in total length and providing several stations with various interchanges. This will also create new north\u2013south routes, resulting in an appropriate network to avoid the city centre.\nThe new lines will mean that more than two million inhabitants of Buenos Aires (accounting for about 70% of the city centre's population) will live within 400 metres of a metro station. The new lines will run between 56 new stations.\n Line F will run from Barracas to Plaza Italia in Palermo and will include 16 new stations. The planned route length of this line is 10.8 km. Construction is due to begin in 2020, once the northern extension of Line H is complete, and as originally planned, the line will have automatic trains and platform screen doors. Line G will connect Retiro and Caballito/Villa Crespo; 12.5 km long with 15 new stations. Originally, construction was due to start in 2012\u20132013, however city legislators opposed the turnkey construction proposed by Chinese firms since the total cost would have been 30% higher if it was done with local companies. After this, it was decided to prioritise the other construction projects in the network.\n Line I will run Parque Chacabuco to Ciudad Universitaria with 18 new stations. The route length is 12.6 km. The future of this line (which had the lowest priority in the expansion plans) is currently uncertain since it has been proposed that a Metrobus line be built instead, which would follow the same trajectory as the line.\n\n\n=== PETERS plan ===\n\nIn October 2015, the city of Buenos Aires together with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan Estrat\u00e9gico y T\u00e9cnico para la Expansi\u00f3n de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts and the need to adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, Line I is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro \u2013 a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.Such plans are subject to approval by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment of many of the current expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the Peters plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning that Line C's extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be redundant, and that the Retiro Norte node would also be made redundant by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.\n\n\n== Modernisation of existing lines ==\nMuch of the modernisation in recent years has centred around the Underground's rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular on Lines A and H. Along with this came the construction of new underground workshops and storage areas on lines A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities on Lines B and D.In September 2015, the president of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015\u20132019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, with the exception of Line E. Lines A and B are to receive Automatic Train Operation systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D is also to receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.Other works being carried out during this period include the improvement of disabled access in older stations, new ventilation systems on lines B, C and D, improvements in electrification (such as replacing overhead lines and substations) on lines A, B, C and D and the replacement of 14 km of track on Lines C and E. The total investment in this period for these new projects has been set at US$1.34 billion.\n\n\n=== Stations ===\n\nStarting in 2007, the network's stations began to receive technological updates ranging from Wi-Fi to interactive terminals. Through BA-WIFI (the citywide free internet service), passengers can use internet free of charge across all stations and aboard trains, though this has been delayed on Line A due to complications surrounding the line's age. There are also several \"digital spaces\" across the network and in its commercial galleries where seating areas are provided, along with recharging stations for mobile devices.In this period, there has also been widespread cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.\n\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\nThe Buenos Aires Underground has had among the longest serving and most varied rolling stock in the world, in part due to the network having been originally built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with the exception of a few UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro-Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.\n\n\n=== Current fleets ===\nIn more recent years, there have been moves towards greater modernisation and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which the government of the City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing the average age of the fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.The network's oldest cars \u2013 the La Brugeoise cars \u2013 were retired in 2013, while its historically most widely used cars \u2013 the Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel cars \u2013 were to be retired in 2015, though this was pushed back to June 2016 following delays on the opening of Santa Fe station on Line H. While there has been much movement of rolling stock, often in a \"hand-me-down\" manner from higher frequency lines to less used lines (the primary recipient being Line E), the transition to newer models has gone fairly smoothly, despite shortfalls in some lines following extensions. The Fiat-Materfer cars have been the primary stand-ins while the new trains arrive, though this role has also been filled by the Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel cars, delaying their retirement.Though Line A ran on a different voltage to the rest of the network, it was converted to the 1500 V used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960s rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan 300/400/500/900 series Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500 V, after which the entire network will be standardised.\n\n\n== Culture and heritage ==\nThe Buenos Aires Underground has historically been characterised by murals and other artistic works in its stations, making it a kind of museum throughout the system. These works, and a number of complete stations, are considered part of the cultural heritage of the city and several of them were declared National Historic Landmarks in 1997.\n\n\n=== National patrimony ===\n\nLine A is renowned for having kept its original 1913 rolling stock running on the line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service in the world at the time. They were built by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian rolling stock manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were originally designed to run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.\n\nIn March 2013, La Brugeoise subway carriages were replaced by new Chinese 200 Series rolling stock, just 11 months prior to their 100-year anniversary on the line. The original rolling stock has since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500 V to run tourist services on the line. During the festivities of the 100-year anniversary of the underground on 1 December 2013, many restored La Brugeoise trains circulated Line A and there was a symphonic orchestra at Plaza de Mayo station as well as free rides for the entire city in order to mark the event. Throughout the week that followed, there were also numerous displays and events across the different lines of the Underground.Currently, the Polvor\u00edn Workshop \u2013 originally inaugurated along with Line A \u2013 is being transformed into a museum to display artefacts and the former rolling stock of the Underground. The workshop also serves as the headquarters for the Association of Friends of the Tramway and many of the Underground's historical artefacts are stored there, such as the wooden UEC Preston \"palace cars\", which also make appearances on Line A during special occasions such as anniversaries and even the inauguration of president Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn in 1983, where he and other officials were transported from the National Congress to the Casa Rosada using these cars.\n\n\n=== Artwork and exhibits ===\n\nThe network has over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from historic murals to modern art. Styles also vary, from mosaic to fileteado, sculpture and installation pieces. Many stations are decorated with intricate ceramic tile work, some of which date back to 1913 when the Underground first opened its doors. Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Ra\u00fal Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.\n\n\n==== Line A ====\nThe oldest line on the network has maintained its original appearance from 1913 and 1914 on the Plaza de Mayo \u2013 Primera Junta segment following restoration works in 1988 for the 75th anniversary of the line and again in 2007. These older stations feature no advertisements, but instead have recreations of original advertisements from the early 20th century. The Line's newest segment, which runs from Pu\u00e1n to San Pedrito, displays more modern artworks, such as those by Uruguayan artist Guillermo Roux at San Jos\u00e9 de Flores station.\n\n\n==== Line B ====\nIn Tronador \u2013 Villa Ort\u00fazar station there are 18 stained glasses that refer to the history of the Villa Ort\u00fazar neighbourhood, where the station is located. In Los Incas \u2013 Parque Chas station there are murals related with different Pre-Columbian era civilisations are exhibited. In 2015, SBASE faced criticism for its incorporation of new artworks in multiple stations on the line. Many of these artworks were painted directly over tiles dating back to the 1930s when the line was opened by the Lacroze company, while others were completely removed and destroyed.\n\n\n==== Line C ====\nFrom Constituci\u00f3n to Diagonal Norte, the line features murals of Iberian landscapes created by Spanish artists such as Ignacio Zuloaga and Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza, which date back to the time of the line's opening by CHADOPyF. General San Mart\u00edn station includes photographic reproductions of the Museo de la Ciudad (City Museum) activities, photographic reproductions and images of the Plaza San Mart\u00edn and photographic reproductions of streets and building of the South zone of the city.\n\n\n==== Line D ====\nThe line's murals on its original Catedral \u2013 Palermo route date back to 1937 and 1940, and began to be restored in 2013. These include murals by Argentine artists Benito Quinquela Mart\u00edn in Plaza Italia station. There are also numerous showcase exhibits in its newer stations, with a series of ceramic reproductions by Ra\u00fal and Daniel De Francisco in Juramento station, ceramic reproductions of 4 murals made by Ra\u00fal Soldi in Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez station and showcases exposing works made in the Ceramic School No.1 in Olleros station Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n station was the network's first \"museum station\" and holds numerous exhibits, among them busts of key political and cultural figures in Argentine culture and history such as Jorge Luis Borges and Manuel Belgrano displayed in glass enclosures in its platform walls.\n\n\n==== Line E ====\nSome modern murals on the line include an homage to the 1996 Argentine film Moebius at San Jos\u00e9 station. The film used the line as its primary filming locations and the murals depict scenes from it. Recently opened Correo Central station has received an award from the Association of Structural Engineers in Argentina for the quality and creativity of the work.\n\n\n==== Line H ====\nThe newest line on the Underground has many Hermenegildo S\u00e1bat mural reproductions related to tango in all stations. Its numerous stations depict different tango singers and poets relating to the neighbourhoods in which they are situated. Santa Fe station was renamed to Santa Fe - Carlos J\u00e1uregui in 2017, in honour of LGBT rights activist Carlos J\u00e1uregui.\n\n\n=== Graffiti ===\n\nGraffiti on the Buenos Aires Underground became particularly prevalent in the late 2000s and early 2010s, and by 2013, four out of every five cars on the network had some degree of graffiti. By January 2015, all the painted cars had been cleaned by night-time cleaning teams using a product specially developed for SBASE which allowed the removal of graffiti without damaging the livery of the cars. Cleaning the 410 vandalised cars had cost the City of Buenos Aires AR$ 10.25 million, while a coat of anti-graffiti paint has been applied to the cars to make future cleaning easier using alcohol.SBASE, along with the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, have adopted a zero tolerance policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400\u20136000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often being made to clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.Painted cars were often worked on by organised groups in a \"whole car\" (graffiti jargon for covering the entire visible surface of the vehicle) manner, severely reducing visibility from inside the cars. Numerous arrests have been made on these groups which often consist of foreign nationals from countries such as Chile, Germany and France; two German nationals and a Chilean national were arrested in January 2016. One high-profile arrest of such a group saw four Argentines detained in 2015 after vandalising a 200 Series train on Line A. Their houses were subsequently raided, uncovering a vast collection of stolen Subte paraphernalia as well as documented evidence of their activities in the form of videos and photographs.According to Clar\u00edn, people from across the world have visited Buenos Aires with the sole purpose of \"bombing\" (painting cars in a clandestine manner), while competition among different groups exists in the form of greater points being earned for painting newer cars or the level of danger experienced. In most cases, the people involved are university educated and with stable employment. In January 2016, a group called Soketes Calcetines was discovered to be offering tourists graffiti tours of the Underground, giving them a chance to paint cars for a fee. The group documented their activities and uploaded them to YouTube in order to promote the business, which has been subsequently shut down with its members arrested.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe Buenos Aires Underground is featured in the 1996 science fiction film Moebius directed by Gustavo Mosquera. In the film, the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of an underground train are investigated by a topologist. The film is based upon the short story, \"A Subway Named M\u00f6bius\" that takes place in the Boston Subway.Other films with scenes shot in the Underground include Highlander II: The Quickening, Focus and The Official Story.In Ricardo Piglia's 1997 novel Plata Quemada, the bank robber protagonists enjoy riding the underground regularly. In Ernesto Sabato's novel On Heroes and Tombs, Fernando, one of its main characters, develops a paranoia with blind people in the underground.One of Jorge Luis Borges' earlier editorial jobs was for Urbe, a promotional magazine for the underground system, which was privately owned at that time. In the magazine, he wrote several articles on sci-fi topics under various pseudonyms.Line B and some of its stations feature heavily in the 2013 Argentine point-and-click adventure game Reversion: The Meeting.El Eternauta is a science fiction comic book created by H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld and Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez in 1957. The story is about an alien invasion in Buenos Aires. Part of the action takes place at the Plaza Italia station, as the heroes try to use the tunnel to escape from the aliens, and successfully exploit the weakness of the alien leader to kill him. The comic book, published in the 1950s, made reference to the \"Canning\" station, a former name of the Scalabrini Ortiz station.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Buenos Aires Underground stations\nList of Latin American rail transit systems by ridership\nList of metro systems\nRail transport in Argentina\nTrams in Buenos Aires\nTransport in Argentina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInteractive Buenos Aires Underground Map (in Spanish)\nBuenos Aires Cuidad Subte \u2013 Official Page (in Spanish)\nMetrov\u00edas  \u2013 Official Page (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "Pablo Luna Carn\u00e9 (May 21, 1879 Alhama de Arag\u00f3n \u2013 January 28, 1942 Madrid) was a Spanish composer. His best-known composition is the aria \"De Espa\u00f1a vengo\" from the zarzuela El ni\u00f1o jud\u00edo.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPablo Luna received his first lessons in music theory from an organist at a church in his birthplace, Alhama de Arag\u00f3n. His father, Pablo Luna Ferrer, who was a member of the Civil Guard, had moved with his family to the valley of the Ebro. He studied harmony with Teodoro Ballo and composition with Miguel Arnaudas. As a violinist, Luna would make money in hotels, cafes, churches and a small chamber orchestra, as well as in theaters. In 1903 he wrote his first operetta, Lolilla, la Petenera which was followed in 1904 by La Escalera de los Duendes (The Ladder of the Elves).\nIn 1905, he moved to Madrid to learn more about the world of zarzuela. In particular, he contacted Ruperto Chap\u00ed, the second director of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, and Tom\u00e1s Barrera Saavedra, a later director of the orchestra, Jer\u00f3nimo Gim\u00e9nez y Bellido and others. He also knew the librettist Luis Pascual Frutos, who wrote the libretto for the operetta Mussetta, which premiered successfully in 1908. This operetta was followed by many other stage works.\nIn Zaragoza premiered with great success 11 March 1911 his zarzuela Molinos de viento (Windmills). Luna was the same who led the orchestra on the night of reopening of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, after a fire, in 1914. In 1918, he released one of his greatest works, El ni\u00f1o Jud\u00edo (The Jewish Boy), an exponent of the new style full of exoticism and sophistication. In March 1925 a grand concert was given in his honor and he was awarded the gold medal of the city of Zaragoza. He closed the trilogy of his three most successful zarzuelas with Benamor (1928).\nHe also wrote eleven screenplays under the pseudonym Garc\u00eda Sandoval. Pablo Luna has various streets named after him, and has a school with his name in Alhama de Arag\u00f3n (Zaragoza).\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Works for orchestra ===\nUna noche en Calatayud, suite-fantas\u00eda\n\u00a1Arre borrico!, jota\n\n\n=== Works for band ===\nBallesteros, paso-doble jota\nDanza del Fuego from \"Benamor\"\nFantas\u00eda from \"Molinos de viento\"\nIntermedio from \"La P\u00edcara Molinera\"\nSelecci\u00f3n from \"El Asombro de Damasco\"\nSelecci\u00f3n from \"El ni\u00f1o jud\u00edo\"\nSelecci\u00f3n from \"Una noche en Calatayud\"\n\n\n=== Theatrical works ===\nRevistas\n\n1909 A.C.T., Que se va el t\u00edo, (with Tom\u00e1s Barrera Saavedra)\n1909 El Club de las solteras, Pasatiempo c\u00f3mico-L\u00edrico in 1 act and 5 scenes, with libretto by Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez del Puente, (with Luis Foglietti)\n1911 El paraguas del abuelo, cuento fant\u00e1stico in 1 act (with Tom\u00e1s Barrera Saavedra) -

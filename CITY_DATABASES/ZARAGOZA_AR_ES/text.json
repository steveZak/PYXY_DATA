        "wiki": "The Aljafer\u00eda Palace (Spanish: Palacio de la Aljafer\u00eda; Arabic: \u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0629\u200e, tr. Qa\u1e63r al-Ja\u02bffariyah) is a fortified medieval palace built during the second half of the 11th century in the Taifa of Zaragoza in Al-Andalus, present day Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. It was the residence of the Banu Hud dynasty during the era of Abu Jaffar Al-Muqtadir. The palace reflects the splendour attained by the Taifa of Zaragoza at the height of its grandeur. It currently contains the Cortes (regional parliament) of the autonomous community of Aragon.The structure holds unique importance in that it is the only conserved testimony of a large building of Spanish Islamic architecture of the era of the Taifas (independent kingdoms). The Aljaferia, along with the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba and the Alhambra are the three best examples of Hispano-Muslim architecture and have special legal protection. In 2001, the original restored structures of the Aljafer\u00eda were included in the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon, a World Heritage Site.The solutions adopted in the ornamentation of the Aljafer\u00eda, such as the use of mixtilinear arcs and springers, the extension of arabesque in large area, and the schematisation and progressive abstraction of the yeserias of a vegetal nature, decisively influenced Almoravid and Almohad art in the Iberian Peninsula. The transition of the decoration towards more geometric motifs is at the basis of Nasrid art.\nAfter the reconquest of Zaragoza in 1118 by Alfonso I of Arag\u00f3n, it became the residence of the Christian kings of the Kingdom of Arag\u00f3n. It was used as a royal residence by Peter IV of Arag\u00f3n (1319-1387) and later, on the main floor, the reform was carried out that converted these rooms into the palace of the Catholic Monarchs in 1492. In 1593 it underwent another restructuring that would turn it into a military fortress, first according to Renaissance designs (which today can be seen in its surroundings, moat and gardens) and later for quartering military regiments. It underwent continuous restructuring and damage, especially with the Sieges of Zaragoza of the Peninsular War, until, unusually for historical buildings in Spain, it was finally restored in the 20th century.\nThe palace was built outside Zaragoza's Roman walls, in the plain of the sar\u00eda. With urban expansion over the centuries, it is now inside the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nMost Aljaferi\u00e1 was completed by Abu Jaffar Al-Muqtadir during the Banu Hud reign in the taifa of Zaragoza, in the 11th century.\nAfter the reconquest of Zaragoza in 1118 by Alfonso of Aragon \"the Battler\", the Aljafer\u00eda became the residence of the Christian kings of Aragon, becoming the main focus of the Aragonese Mudejar diffusion. It was used as a royal residence by Peter IV of Aragon \"the Ceremonious\" and later, on the main floor, was carried out the reform that turned these paradors into the palace of the Catholic Monarchs in 1492. In 1593 it underwent another reform that would make it into a military fortress, first according to Renaissance designs (which today can be seen in their surroundings, pit and gardens) and later as a quarters of military regiments. It underwent continuous reforms and major damage, especially during the Sieges of Saragossa of the Napoleonic French invasion, until finally it was restored in the second half of the twentieth century and currently houses the Parliament of Aragon.\nOriginally the building was outside the Roman walls, in the plain of the Sar\u00eda or place where the Muslims developed the military fanfare known as La Almozara. With the urban expansion through the years, the building has remained within the city. There is a small space with landscaped garden environment.\n\n\n== Troubadour Tower ==\n\nThe oldest construction of the Aljafer\u00eda is today known as the Troubadour Tower. The tower received this name from Antonio Garcia Gutierrez\u2019s 1836 romantic drama The Troubadour, based on the palace. This drama became a libretto for Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s opera Il trovatore in 1853.\n\nThe tower is a defensive structure, with a quadrangular base and five levels which date back to the end of the 9th century AD, in the period governed by the first Banu Tujib, Muhammad Alanqur, who was named after Muhammad I of C\u00f3rdoba, independent Emir of  Cordoba. According to Caba\u00f1ero Subiza (1998) the Tower was built in the second half of the 10th century. In its lower part, the tower contains vestiges of the beginning of the heavy walls of alabaster ashlar bond masonry, and continues upwards with plank lining of simple plaster and lime concrete, which is a thinner substance for reaching greater heights. The exterior does not reflect the division of the five internal floors and appears as an enormous prism, broken by narrow embrasures. Access to the interior was gained through a small door at such height that it was only possible to enter by means of a portable ladder. Its initial function was, by all indications, military.\nThe first level conserves the building structure of the 9th century and shelters two separated naves and six sections, which are separated by means of two cruciform pillars and divided by lowered horseshoe arcs. In spite of its simplicity, they form a balanced space and could be used as baths.\nThe second floor repeats the same spatial scheme of the previous one, and remains of a Muslim factory of the 11th century in the brick canvases, which indicates that, from the 14th century something similar happens with the appearance of the last two floors, of Mud\u00e9jar invoice, and whose construction would be due to the construction of the palace of Peter IV of Aragon, that is connected with the Tower of the Troubadour thanks to a corridor, and would be configured as tower of homage. The arches of these plants already reflect its Christian structure, because they are slightly pointed arches, and support unveiled roofs, but flat structures in wood.\nIts function in the 9th and 10th centuries was the watch tower and defensive bastion. It was surrounded by a moat. It was later integrated by the Banu Hud family in the construction of the castle-palace of the Aljafer\u00eda, constituting itself in one of the towers of the defensive framework of the outside north canvas. From the Spanish Reconquista, it continued being used like tower of the homage and in 1486 became dungeon of the Inquisition. As a tower-prison was also used in the 18th and 19th centuries, as demonstrated by the numerous graffiti inscribed there by the p2.\n\n\n== Moorish Taifal palace ==\n\nThe building of the palace \u2013 mostly made between 1065 and 1081\u2014  was ordered by Ab\u00fa Ja'far Ahmad ibn Sulaym\u00e1n al-Muqtadir Billah, known by his honorary title of Al-Muqtadir (The powerful), second monarch of the Banu Hud dynasty, as a symbol of the power achieved by the Taifa of Zaragoza in the second half of the 11th century. The sultan himself called his palace \"Qasr al-Surur\" (Palace of the Joy) and to the throne room which he presided the receptions and embassies of the \"Maylis al-Dahab\" (Golden Hall) as it is testified in the following verses of the Sultan self:\n\n Oh Palace of the Joy!, Oh Golden Hall!Because of you, I reached the maximum of my wishes.\nAnd even though in my kingdom I had nothing else,\nfor me you are everything I could wish for.\nThe name of Aljafer\u00eda is first documented in a text by Al-Yazzar as-Saraqusti (active between 1085 and 1100) \u2013 which also transmits the name of the architect of the Taifal palace, the Slav Al-Halifa Zuhayr\u2014 and another from Ibn Idari of 1109, as a derivation from the pre-name of Al-Muqtadir, Abu Ya'far, and \"Ya'far\", \"Al-Yafariyya\", which evolved to \"Aliafaria\" and from there to \"Aljafer\u00eda\".\nThe general layout of the whole palace adopts the archetype of the castles of the desert of Syria and Jordan of the first half of the 8th century (such as Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, Msatta, Jirbat al-Mafyar, and from the first Abbasid stage, the castle of Ujaydir) which were square-shaped and ultrasemicircular towers in its cloths, with a central tripartite space, which leaves three rectangular spaces of which the central one houses a courtyard with pools and, at the northern and southern ends of the same, the palatial rooms and the dependencies of daily life.\n\nIn the Aljafer\u00eda, this castle-palace model is honored, whose noble zone is located in the central segment of its square plant, although the alignment of the sides of this plant is irregular. It is the central rectangle that houses the palatial dependencies, organized around a courtyard with cisterns in front of the north and south porticos to which the rooms and royal saloons are poured.\nAt the north and south ends are the porticos and room dependencies, and in the case of the Aljafer\u00eda, the most important of these sectors is the north, that in origin was endowed with a second plant and had greater depth, besides being preceded by an open and profusely decorated column wall that stretched in two arms by two pavilions on its flanks and served as a theatrical porch to the throne room (the golden hall of the verses of Al-Muqtadir) located at the bottom. It produced a set of heights and cubic volumes beginning with the perpendicular corridors of the ends, it was emphasized by the presence of the height of the second floor and ended with the tower of the troubadour that offered its volume in the background to the look of a spectator located in the courtyard. All this, reflected also in the cistern, enhanced the royal area, which is corroborated by the presence at the eastern end of the northern border of a small private mosque with mihrab.\nIn the center of the northern wall of the interior of the Golden Hall was a blind arch \u2013 where the king stood \u2013 in whose thread was a very traditional geometric pattern imitating the latticework of the mihrab fa\u00e7ade of the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, building to which it was sought to emulate. In this way, from the courtyard, it appeared half-hidden by the plots of columns of both the archway of access to the Golden Hall and those of the immediate portico, which gave an appearance of latticework, an illusion of depth, which admired the visitor and lent splendor to the figure of the monarch.\n\nIn order to remember the appearance of the palace at the end of the 11th century, we must imagine that all the vegetal, geometric and epigraphic reliefs were polychromed in shades in which red and blue predominated for backgrounds and gold for reliefs, which, together with the soffits in alabaster with epigraphic decoration and the floors of white marble, gave the whole an aspect of great magnificence.\nThe various avatars suffered by the Aljafer\u00eda, have made disappear from this layout of the 11th century a large part of the stuccos that made up the decoration and, with the construction of the palace of the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, the entire second floor, which broke the ends of the Taifal arches. In the current restoration, the original arabesques are observed in darker color and in white and smooth finishes the reconstruction of plaster of the decoration the arches, whose structure, however, remains undamaged.\nThe decoration of the walls of the Golden Hall has disappeared for the most part, although remains of its decoration are preserved in the Museo de Zaragoza and in the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid. Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez began its restoration, restoring the decorations that existed in its places of origin and extracting complete emptyings of the arcades of the south portico.\nThese were the functions and aspect of the 11th century Banu Hud palace. Below are the most important parts of the building as they are today.\n\n\n=== North side halls ===\n\nIn the north wall, the most important complex of buildings of the Banu Hud period is built, as it includes the Throne Room or Golden Hall and the small private mosque, located on the eastern side of the access portico that serves as an antechamber to the oratory). In its interior it houses a mihrab in the southeast corner, whose niche, therefore, is oriented in the direction of Mecca, as it happens in all the mosques except in the one of C\u00f3rdoba.\nThe soils of the royal stays were of marble and walked them a plinth of alabaster. The capitels were of alabaster, except some of reused marble of Caliphate period. These rooms were surrounded by a band of epigraphic decoration with Kufic characters reproducing Quran surahs that alluded to the symbolic meaning of ornamentation. The surahs corresponding to these inscriptions have been deduced from the surviving fragments.\nIn two of these calligraphic reliefs can be the name of Al-Muqtadir, reason why the construction of the palace has been dated, at least in a first phase, between 1065 and 1080. They say verbatim \"This [= the Aljafer\u00eda] was ordered by Ahmed al-Muqtadir Bill\u00e1h\".\n\n\n=== Golden Hall ===\n\nThe Golden Hall had at its ends east and west two rooms that were private bedrooms possibly of royal use. Today the bedroom of the western flank has been lost, which was used as a royal bedroom and also used the Aragonese kings until the 14th century.\nMost of the yeserias of arabesques, which carpeted the walls of these stays with decorative panels plastered with plaster, as well as an alabaster base of two and a half meters high and the white marble floors of the original palace, have been lost. The remains that have been preserved, both in museums and the few that are in this royal hall, nevertheless allow to reconstruct the appearance of this polychrome decoration, which, in its day, should have been splendid.\nCeilings, wood carvings, reproduced the sky, and the whole room was an image of the cosmos, clothed with symbols of the power exercised over the celestial universe by the monarch of Saragossa, who thus appeared as heir to the caliphs.\nThe access to the Golden Hall is made through a canvas with three vanes. A very large central one, consisting of five double marble columns with very stylized Islamic alabaster capitals that support four mixtilinear arches, among which, in height, there are other simpler horseshoe.\n\n\n=== Entrance portico to the Golden Hall ===\n\nTowards the south, another dependence of similar size is poured that it pours to the courtyard by a portico of great polilobulated arcades. Again there is a tripartite space, and its east and west ends extend perpendicularly with two lateral galleries which are accessed by wide polyhedral lobes and which end at the end of their arms in separate pointed arches also polilobulated whose alfiz is decorated by complex laqueus and reliefs of arabesques.\nThis whole structure seeks an appearance of solemnity and majesty that the scant depth of these stays would not give a spectator to access the king's room. In addition, all the ornamentation of yeserias of the palace was polychrome in shades of blue and red in the back and gold in the arabesques. Among the filigrees is the representation of a bird, an unusual zoomorphic figure in Islamic art that could represent a pigeon, a pheasant or a symbol of the king as winged.\nThe traces of interlocking mixtilinear arches are characteristic of this palace and are given for the first time in the Aljafer\u00eda, from where they will be diffused to the future Islamic constructions.\nOn the eastern side of the portico is a sacred space, the mosque, which is accessed through a portal inspired by caliph art and described below.\n\n\n=== Mosque and the oratory ===\n\nAt the eastern end of the entrance portico to the Golden Hall, there is a small mosque or private oratory for use by the monarch and his courtiers. It is accessed through a portal that ends in a horseshoe arch inspired by the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba but with S-shaped springers, a novelty that will imitate the Almoravid art and Nasrid art. This arch rests on two columns with capitals of leaves very geometricals, in the line of the realizations Granadan art of solutions in Moc\u00e1rabe. Its alfiz is profusely ornamented with vegetal decoration and on it is arranged a frieze of half-point arcs crossed.\nAlready inside the oratory there is a reduced space of square plant but with chamfered corners, that turns it into a false octagonal plant. In the southeast sector, oriented towards Mecca, is located the niche of the mihrab. The front of the mihrab is conformed by a very traditional horseshoe arch, with Cordoban shapes and alternating camouflage threads, some decorated with vegetal reliefs and other smooth ones (although originally they were decorated with pictorial decoration), reminiscent of the mihrab thread of the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, only what were rich materials (mosaics and Byzantine bricklayers) in Zaragoza, with greater material poverty than the Caliphian C\u00f3rdoba, are plaster stucco and polychrome, the latter having been lost in almost the entire Palace. Continuing with the arch of the portal, an alfiz framed its back, in whose curved triangles two mirrored rosettes are recessed, as is the dome of the interior of the mihrab.\n\nThe rest of the walls of the mosque are decorated with blind mixtilineal arches linked and decorated throughout the surface with vegetable arabesques of Caliph's inspiration. These arches lean on columns topped with capitals of slender basket. A slab of square marble slabs covers the bottom of the walls of the mosque.\nAll this is topped with a splendid theory of interlocking polyblocked arches, which, in this case, are not blind in their entirety, because those in the chamfered corners let now see the angles of the square plant structure. This gallery is the only one that conserves remains of the pictorial decoration of the 11th century, whose motives were rescued by Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez Almech after removing the liming with which they were covered after the passage of the Aljafer\u00eda to chapel. Unfortunately, this restorer, praiseworthy for having saved from the ruin of the monument, worked in an age of different criteria to the present ones, because he intended to restore all the elements to their original appearance. For this he repainted with acrylic paint the traces of Islamic remains, which makes this performance irreversible and, consequently, we will never see the, although very faded, original pigment.\nThe dome of the mosque was not preserved, because that is the height in which the palace of the Catholic Monarchs was built; However, the characteristic octagonal plant suggests that the solution should follow literally the existing ones in the maqsurah of the mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, that is to say, a dome of semicircular arches that are interlaced forming an octagon in the center. The covering proposal of Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez is, however, in this case, reversible, as it is a detachable dome of plaster. In 2006, Bernab\u00e9 Caba\u00f1ero Subiza, C. Lasa Gracia and J. L. Mateo L\u00e1zaro postulated that \"the nerves of the vault [...] should have the section of horseshoe arches forming an eight-pointed star pattern with a dome agglomerated in the center, as those existing in the two domes of the transept of the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n\n=== South side halls ===\nCompleting the tour of the 11th-century palace, one arrives at the south portico, which consists of an arcade on its southern flank that gives access to a portico with two lateral stays.\nThis portico was the vestibule of a great south hall that would have the same tripartite disposition of the existent one in the north side, and of which only the arcades of access of mixtilineal arches of geometric decoration remains. Perhaps in this southern sector the greatest daring in arches, through the interlocking of lobulated forms, mixtilinea, and the inclusion of small reliefs of shafts and capitals with exclusively ornamental function.\nThe complexity of laqueus, arabesques and carvings leads to a Baroque aesthetic, which is a prelude to the filigree of the art of the Alhambra and which are some of the most beautiful of all Al-Andalusian art.\n\n\n== Courtyard of Santa Isabel ==\n\nIt is the open and landscaped space that unified the whole Taifal palace. To it would pour the north and south porticos, and probably rooms and outbuildings to the east and west of this central courtyard.\nIts name comes from the birth in the Aljafer\u00eda of the infanta Elizabeth of Aragon, that was in 1282 Queen of Portugal. The original pool of the south has been conserved, whereas the one of the north front, of the 14th century, has been covered with a wood floor. The restoration tried to give the courtyard the original splendor, and for that a marble floor was arranged in the corridors that surround the orange and flower garden.\nThe arcade that is contemplated looking towards the south portico is restored by means of the emptying of the original arcs that are deposited in the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid and in the Museo de Zaragoza . They suppose the greater audacity and distance for their innovation with respect to the caliphs models of the arcades of the north side.\nAccording to Christian Ewert, who has studied for fifteen years the arches of the Aljafer\u00eda, the more related to noble zones (Golden Hall and Mosque) are the ornaments of the arcades, more respect they have to the C\u00f3rdoban tradition from which they leave.\n\n\n== Palace of Peter IV of Aragon \"the Ceremonious\" ==\nAfter the taking of Saragossa by Alfonso the Battler in 1118, the Aljafer\u00eda was habilitated like palace of the kings of Aragon and the church, not being substantially modified until the 14th century with the performance of Peter IV of Aragon \"the Ceremonious\".\n\nThis king extended the palatial dependencies in 1336 and had constructed the Church of San Mart\u00edn in the entrance courtyard to the alc\u00e1zar. In this time the use of the Aljafer\u00eda is documented like place of departure of the route that took to Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza, where the Aragonese monarchs were solemnly crowned and they swore the Fueros of Aragon.\n\n\n=== Chapel of San Mart\u00edn ===\nThe chapel of San Mart\u00edn takes advantage of the canvases of the northwest corner of the wall, to the point that one of its towers was used as sacristy and gave name to the courtyard that gives access to the Taifal enclosure.\nThe factory, of Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar style, consists of two naves of three sections each, in origin orientated to the east and supported in two pillars with semicolumns attached in the half of the faces of the pillar, whose section is remembered in the quadrilobed that shelter the shield of arms of the King of Aragon in the spandrels of the portal, that is already of the first decade of the 15th century and in which we will stop later.\n\nThe vaults of these naves, of simple rib vault, are lodged on formeros arches and pointed perpia\u00f1os arches, whereas the diagonals are of half point. At the corners of the vaults appear florets with the coat of arms of the Aragonese monarchy. Of its decoration only fragments of the pictorial covering and some mixtilineal arches are preserved directly inspired in the Muslim palace.\nIt emphasizes in the exterior the Mud\u00e9jar portal of brick referred to previously, built in the time of Martin of Aragon \"the Humane\" and opened in the last section of the south nave.\nThis portal is articulated by a carpanel arch very recessed, covered by another pointed of greater dimensions. Framing both, a double alfiz decorated with taqueado jaqu\u00e9s motifs forming lozenge cloths.\n\nIn the spandrels, as it was pointed out, two quadrilobed medallions appear that harbor shields with the image of the insignia of king of Aragon. In the resulting tympanum between the arches there is a band of interlocking mixtilineal blind arches, which again refer to the series of the Banu Hud palace. This strip is interrupted by a box that houses a newly incorporated relief.\nThe chapel was remodeled in the 18th century, placing a nave ahead of it and covering the Mud\u00e9jar portal previously described. The pillars and walls were refurbished and plastered to the Neoclassical style. All the reform was eliminated during the restorations of Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez, although by the existing photographic documentation, it is known that there was a slender tower that now appears with a crenellated finish inspired by the aspect of the Mud\u00e9jar church, and in the 18th century culminated with a curious bulbous spire.\n\n\n=== Mud\u00e9jar Palace ===\nIt is not an independent palace, but an extension of the Muslim palace that was still in use. Peter IV of Aragon tried to provide more spacious rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms to the Aljafer\u00eda, because the Taifal bedrooms had remained small for the use of the Ceremonious.\nThese new rooms are grouped on the northern sector of the Al-Andalusian palace, at different levels of height. This new Mud\u00e9jar factory was extraordinarily respectful of the pre-existing construction, both in plan and elevation, and is made up of three large rectangular halls covered by extraordinary aljarfes or wooden mud\u00e9jar ceilings.\nAlso from this time is the western arcade of pointed arches of the Patio de Santa Isabel, intrados in lobed arcs, and a small bedroom of square plant and covered with an octagonal dome of wood and a curious door of entrance in pointed arc of lobed intrados circumscribed in a very fine alfiz, whose spandrel is decked out of arabesque. This door leads to a triple lodge of semicircular arches. The bedroom is located on the building block above the mosque.\n\n\n== Palace of the Catholic Monarchs ==\nIn the last years of the 15th century the Catholic Monarchs ordered to construct a palace for royal use on the north wing of the Al-Andalusian enclosure, configuring a second plant superposed to the one of the existing palace. The building broke the high parts of the Taifal stays, where inserted the beams that would support the new palace.\n\nThe works are dated between 1488 and 1495 and were followed by Mud\u00e9jar masters, maintained the tradition of Mud\u00e9jar bricklayers in the Aljafer\u00eda.\nThe palace is accessed by climbing the noble staircase, a monumental building composed of two large sections with geometric yeserias gables illuminated by half-angled windows of small decoration of leaves and stems of Gothic roots and Mud\u00e9jar influences, topped in crochet on the key of the arches.\nThe grandiose ceiling, as in the rest of the palace buildings, is covered with superb cross-vaulted vaults arranged between the j\u00e1cenas, and they are decorated with tempera painting with iconographic motifs related to the Catholic Monarchs: the yoke and the arrows alternate with squares of decoration in grisao of grotesques and candelieri, that announces the typical decoration of the Renaissance.\nThe stairs give access to a corridor in the first floor that communicates with the palatial dependencies proper. It opens to a gallery of columns of torso stem that rest on shoes with anthropomorphic reliefs at their ends. To support this viewpoint and the rest of the new dependencies it was necessary to section the high areas of the Taifal halls of the 11th century and to have before the north portico five powerful octagonal pillars that, next to some archways pointed behind them, form a new antepartum that unites The two Al-Andalusian perpendicular pavilions above.\nIt emphasizes the main entrance to the Throne Room: a trilobed recessed arch with a five-lobed tympanum, at the center of which is represented the coat of arms of the monarchy of the Catholic Monarchs, which includes the coats of arms of the kingdoms of Castile, Le\u00f3n, Aragon, Sicily and Granada, supported by two lieutenant lions. The rest of the decorative field is finished with a delicate vegetal ornamentation of stamped invoice, which reappears in the capitals of the jambs. The entire portal is made of hardened plaster, which is the predominant material in the interior of the Aljafer\u00eda, as Mud\u00e9jar craftsmen perpetuate the materials and techniques that are common in Islam.\nIn the same wall, two large windows of triple mixtilineal arc with shutters on their keys are escorted by the entrance, thanks to which the inner space of the royal rooms is illuminated.\nOnce the space of the gallery is crossed, several rooms are arranged that precede to the great Throne Room, that are denominated \"rooms of the lost steps\". These are three small rooms of square plan communicated to each other by big windows shut with lattices that give to the Patio de San Mart\u00edn, and that served as waiting rooms for those who were to be received in audience by the kings.\n\nIn our days only two are visible, because the third one was closed when replacing the dome of the mosque. Its roof was moved to a room adjoining the Throne Room.\nOne of the most valuable elements of these rooms are their floors, which originally were square azulejos and hexagonal ceramic alfardones glazed in colors, forming capricious borders. They were made in the historic pottery of Loza de Muel at the end of the 15th century. From the preserved fragments has been set to restore the entire floor with ceramics that mimics the shape and layout of the former floor, but not its quality glazed reflections.\nThe other remarkable element is its excellent Mud\u00e9jar-Catholic Monarchs style roofs, constituted by three magnificent taujeles of Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar carpenters. These ceilings present geometric reticules of wood later carved, painted and gilded with gold leaf, whose moldings show the well-known heraldic motifs of the Catholic Monarchs: the yoke, the arrows and the Gordian knot united to the classic motto \"Tanto monta\" (both mounts to undo the Gordian knot), both mounts to cut it as to untie it, according to the well-known anecdote attributed to Alexander the Great), as well as a good number of leaflet florets finished with pendant (pinjante) pineapples.\n\n\n=== Throne Room ===\nMore complex and difficult to describe is the magnificence and sumptuousness of the ceiling that covers the Throne Room. Its dimensions are very considerable (20 metres (66 feet) in length by 8 in width) and its Artesonado coffered ceiling is supported by thick beams and sleepers decorated with laqueus that at intersections form eight-pointed stars, while generating thirty large and deep square coffins.\nInside these coffins are inscribed octagons with a central flower of curly leaf that finish in large hanging pine cones that symbolize fertility and immortality. This ceiling was reflected in the ground, which reproduces the thirty squares with their respective octagons inscribed.\n\nUnder the Artesonado coffered ceiling there is an airy gallery of passable arches and with open windows, from which the guests could contemplate the royal ceremonies. Finally, all this structure is based on an arrocabe with moldings in carved navicella with vegetal and zoomorphic themes (cardina, branches, fruits of the vine, winged dragons, fantastic animals...), and in the frieze that surrounds the whole perimeter of the room, there appears a legend of Gothic calligraphy that reads: Ferdinandus, Hispaniarum, Siciliae, Corsicae, Balearumque rex, principum optimus, prudens, strenuus, pius, constans, iustus, felix, et Helisabeth regina, religione et animi magnitudine supra mulierem, insigni coniuges, auxiliante Christo, victoriosissimi, post liberatam a mauris Bethycam, pulso veteri feroque hoste, hoc opus construendum curarunt, anno salutis MCCCCLXXXXII.\nThe translation of this inscription is: Ferdinand, King of the Spains, Sicily, Corsica and Balearic, the best one of the princes, prudent, courageous, pious, constant, just, jocose, and Isabella, queen, superior to all woman because her pity and greatness of spirit, distinguished matrimony very victorious with the help of Christ, after liberating Andalusia from Moors, expelled the old and ferocious enemy, ordered to build this work the year of the Salvation of 1492.\n\n\n== Early-Modern and Modern times ==\nAt the beginning of 1486, the area of the Patio de San Mart\u00edn was destined to the headquarters of the Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition and facilities were installed adjacent to the courtyard to house the officers of this organization. It is likely that this is the origin of the use as a prison of the Tower of the Troubadour.\nThe new function (which lasted until the early-18th century) triggered an event that would culminate in a reform project undertaken under the mandate of Philip II of Spain by which he would henceforth become a military base. In 1591, in the events known as the Alterations of Aragon, the persecuted secretary of King Philip II, Antonio P\u00e9rez took refuge at the Privilege of Manifestation contemplated by the Fuero of Aragon in order to elude the imperial troops. However, the Tribunal of the Inquisition had jurisdiction over all the fueros of the kingdoms, and, for that reason, he was held in a cell of the inquisitorial headquarters of the Aljafer\u00eda, which provoked an uprising of the people before what they considered a violation of the foral law, and they went to the assault of the Aljafer\u00eda to rescue him. After the forceful action of the royal army, the revolt was put down, and Philip II decided to consolidate the Aljafer\u00eda as a fortified citadel under his authority to prevent similar revolts.\n\nThe design of the work, which consisted of a military construction, was entrusted to the Italian-Sienese military engineer, Tiburzio Spannocchi. He constructed a set of habitat attached to the south and east walls that hid the ultrasemicircular turrets in its interior, although in the east fa\u00e7ade it did not affect those who flanked the entrance door and these onwards. Surrounding the entire building, a marlon wall was erected leaving inside a round space and ending at its four corners in four pentagonal bastions, whose starts can be seen today. The entire complex was surrounded by a moat twenty meters wide, which was saved by two drawbridges on the east and north flanks.\nThe Aljafer\u00eda remained without substantial changes until 1705, in which due to the War of Spanish Succession it was lodging of two companies of French troops that took to a regrowth of the parapets of the low wall of the pit effected by the military engineer Dezveheforz.\n\nBut the decisive transformation as quartering took place in 1772 at the initiative of Charles III of Spain, in which all the facades were remodeled to the way in which the western one is presently, and that the interior spaces were used as dependencies for the soldiers and officers who were staying in the building. In the western third of the palace was set up a large courtyard to which the rooms of the different companies, made with simplicity and functionality, following the rationalist spirit of the second half of the 18th century and the practical purpose to which the constructed areas were destined so. Only the addition in 1862 by Isabella II of Spain of four Gothic-Revival towers, of which the ones located in the north-western and south-western corner, stand today.\nIt was precisely in the mid-19th century when Mariano Nougu\u00e9s Secall raised the alarm due to the deterioration of the al-Andalusian and Mud\u00e9jar remains of the palace in its 1845 report entitled Descripci\u00f3n e historia del castillo de la Aljafer\u00eda, a rigorous study in which it was urged to preserve this valuable historical-artistic ensemble. Even the Queen Isabella II of Spain contributed funds for the restoration, and a commission was created in 1848 to undertake it; but in 1862 the Aljafer\u00eda passed from property of the Royal Patrimony to the Ministry of the War, which aborted its restoration and would aggravate the damages produced.\nThe deterioration still continued until that since 1947 was being integrally restored by the architect Francisco \u00cd\u00f1iguez Almech, the restoration was started and completed during the government of Francisco Franco.\nIn the 1960s it was used as a military barracks, and the decoration was covered with plaster with the aim of protecting it.\nIn 1984 the regional parliamentary commission created to find a definitive headquarters to the Cortes of Aragon recommended locating the autonomous parliament into the Aljafer\u00eda Palace and the City Council of Zaragoza (owner of the building) agreed to transfer the council to a section of the building for a period of 99 years.In this way the section was adapted and the building again restored by \u00c1ngel Peropadre, Juan Antonio Souto (archaeological work), Luis Franco Lahoz and Mariano Pem\u00e1n Gav\u00edn, who carried out for the location of the headquarters of the Cortes de Aragon. The Aljafer\u00eda was finally declared an artistic and historical monument in 1998 with presence of prince Philip VI.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBORR\u00c1S GUALIS, Gonzalo (1991). \"La ciudad isl\u00e1mica\".

        "wiki": "Our Lady of the Pillar (Spanish: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar) is the name given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the context of the traditional belief that Mary, while living in Jerusalem, supernaturally appeared to the Apostle James the Greater in AD 40 while he was preaching in what is now Spain. Those who adhere to this belief consider this appearance to be the only recorded instance of Mary exhibiting the mystical phenomenon of bilocation. Among Catholics, it is also considered the first Marian apparition, being unique due to having occurred while Mary was still living on Earth.This title is also associated with a wooden image commemorating the apparition, which is now enshrined at the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. Pope Callixtus III granted indulgences for visitors to the shrine in 1456.  Pope Innocent XIII in 1730 mandated her veneration throughout the Spanish Empire. On 20 May 1905, Pope Pius X granted the image a canonical coronation.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is considered the Patroness of Aragon and its capital Zaragoza, and of the Spanish Civil Guard. Her feast day is 12 October, which coincides with Columbus Day, the national holiday of Spain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early tradition ===\n\nCatholic tradition holds that, in the early days of Christianity, the Apostles of Jesus spread the Gospel throughout the known world, with James the Greater evangelizing in Roman Hispania (modern-day Spain). He confronted great difficulties in his missionary efforts and faced severe discouragement. In AD 40, while he was praying by the banks of the Ebro at Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza), Mary bilocated from Jerusalem, where she was living at the time, and appeared to James, accompanied by thousands of angels, to console and encourage him.Some of the earliest archaeological evidence of Marian devotion in Zaragoza is found in Christian tombs dating from Roman days, which appear to bear images representing the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. In the 4th century, the presence of votive images placed on columns or pillars is attested. The oldest written testimony of devotion to the Blessed Virgin in Zaragoza is usually identified as that of Pedro Librana in 1155. There is evidence that the site attracted pilgrims from across the Iberian Peninsula during the 13th century, e.g. reflected in the work Milagros de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora by Gonzalo de Berceo, dated to the 1250s or early 1260s. The appellation Santa Mar\u00eda del Pilar is attested for 1299.\nThe claim that the first church had been the oldest in Hispania, built in AD 40 by James the Greater, is first recorded in 1318.The tradition of the Marian apparition can be traced to the 15th century: In either 1434 or 1435, a fire destroyed the alabaster altarpiece. The replacement altarpiece features bas-relief representations of the Marian apparition. The image of the Virgen del Pilar venerated today also dates to this period. It executed in the late Gothic style of Juan de la Huerta.Pope Calixtus III in a bull issued on 23 September 1456 declares a seven year indulgence for those who visit Our Lady of Saragossa. The text of the bull specifically mentions a pillar, for the first time suggesting the existence of an image known as Our Lady of the Pillar.\nThe feast day of 12 October was officially introduced by the Council of Zaragoza in 1640.According to the account by Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda (d. 1665) in her Mystical City of God, Mary, mother of Jesus, was transported from Jerusalem to Hispania during the night, on a cloud carried by angels. During the journey, the angels also built a pillar of marble, and a miniature image of Mary with the Child Jesus.\n\n\n=== Approval ===\n\nThe apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar was accepted as canonical by Pope Innocent XIII in 1723. So many contradictions had arisen concerning the miraculous origin of the church that Spain appealed to Innocent XIII to settle the controversy. After careful investigation, the twelve cardinals, in whose hands the affair rested, adopted the following account, which was approved by the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 7 August 1723, and later inserted in the lessons of the office of the feast of our Lady of the Pillar, celebrated on 12 October:\n\nOf all the places that Spain offers for the veneration of the devout, the most illustrious is doubtless the sanctuary consecrated to God under the invocation of the Blessed Virgin, under the title of our Lady of the Pillar, at Saragossa.\nAccording to ancient and pious tradition, St. James the Greater, led by Providence into Spain, spent some time at Saragossa. He there received a signal favour from the Blessed Virgin. As he was praying with his disciples one night, upon the banks of the Ebro, as the same tradition informs us, the Mother of God, who still lived, appeared to him, and commanded him to erect an oratory in that place.  The apostle delayed not to obey this injunction, and with the assistance of his disciples soon constructed a small chapel. In the course of time a larger church was built and dedicated, which, with the dedication of Saint Saviour's, is kept as a festival in the city and Diocese of Saragossa on the 4th of October.\nJames returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a martyr, beheaded in AD 44 during the reign of Herod Agrippa. His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain. The year AD 40 is the earliest recognised Marian apparition in the Catholic Church,  dating to a time when Mary, the mother of Jesus, was still alive.Pope Clement XII allowed the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar all over the Spanish Empire in 1730.  Since the feast day (12 October) coincides with the discovery of the Americas (12 October 1492), Mary was later named as Patroness of the Hispanic World under this title.\n\n\n== Image ==\n\n\n=== Zaragoza ===\n\nA fire in 1434 burned down the church that preceded the present basilica.\nThe construction of the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, Zaragoza was started in 1681 and ended in 1711. \n\nThe wooden statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary is in the Late Gothic style. It stands 39 centimetres (15 in) tall, on a pillar of jasper with a height of 1.8 metres (5.9 ft).\nThe statue depicts Mary with the Child Jesus on her left arm, who has a dove sitting on his left palm.\nSome reports state that an earlier wooden image was destroyed when the church burned down in 1434, consistent with an attribution of the current image to Juan de la Huerta (d. 1462) or his school.It appears that folk belief in some cases may be inclined to regard the Saragossa image as miraculous, sculptured by the angels as they transported Mary from Jerusalem to Saragossa (Zaragoza); this mystical tradition goes back to Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda (d. 1665),  herself the object of frequent \"mystical bilocation\" (i.e. she reported that she was often \"transported by the aid of the angels\" ), who gave an account to this effect in her Mystical City of God; however, unlike the tradition of the Marian apparition itself, the miraculous origin of the image is not part of the tradition recognized by the Holy See as canonical.\nSince the 16th century, the pillar is usually draped in a skirt-like cover called manto \"mantle\".\nAs a whole, it is protected by a bronze case and then another case of silver.\nThe image was canonically crowned in 1905 during the reign of Pope Pius X.  The crown was designed by the Marquis of Gri\u00f1i, valued at 450,000 pesetas (c. USD 2.6 million as of 2017).\n\n\n=== Other depictions ===\nOur Lady of the Pillar is a common motif of the Madonna and Child in Spanish art; extant examples other than the Saragossa image date from the Renaissance period onward. Depictions become especially numerous following the introduction of the feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Feast day ==\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of the Pillar is celebrated on 12 October and she is the Patroness of the Hispanic peoples and the Spanish Civil Guard.  A grand nine-day festival known as Fiestas del Pilar is celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza) every year in her honour. The modern Fiestas del Pilar, as they developed since the 19th century, begin on the weekend preceding 12 October and they end on the Sunday after 12 October (i.e. they move between 5\u201313 and 11\u201319 October). They were declared as a \"national holiday of touristic interest\" (Fiesta de Inter\u00e9s Tur\u00edstico Nacional) by the Ministerio de Comercio y Turismo in 1980.\nAs 12 October happens to coincide with the day of the year 1492 when land was first sighted on Columbus' First Voyage, \nthe Fiesta de la Raza Espa\u00f1ola, first proposed in 1913 by Faustino Rodr\u00edguez-San Pedro y D\u00edaz-Arg\u00fcelles (in the USA later dubbed \"Columbus Day\", as Columbus tends to be considered Italian rather than Spanish in North America) falls on the same date.\nThe Fiesta de la Raza Espa\u00f1ola was declared the national holiday of Spain in a decree by Antonio Maura and king Alfonso XIII\nof 1918. The alternative name D\u00eda de la Hispanidad was proposed in the late 1920s by Ramiro de Maeztu, based on a suggestion by Zacar\u00edas de Vizcarra.\nAfter the Civil War, on 12 October 1939, the D\u00eda de la Raza was celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza), presided by Francisco Franco, with a special devotion to the Virgen del Pilar. Chilean foreign vice-secretary Germ\u00e1n Vergara Donoso commented that the \"profound significance of the celebration was the intimate inter-penetration of the homage to the Race and the devotion to Our Lady of the Pillar, i.e. the symbol of the ever more extensive union between America and Spain.\"\nThe name of D\u00eda de la Hispanidad was introduced as the official name of the national holiday in a decree of 9 January 1958.\nDuring the transition to democracy, there was a proposal to shift the national day to 6 December, the day of adoption of the Constitution, but in the end, in a decree of 1982, the day of 12 October was retained, under the name of  Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a y D\u00eda de la Hispanidad. In 1987, the name was reduced to just D\u00eda de la Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n== Veneration of Our Lady of the Pillar around the world ==\nPilar, short for Maria del Pilar, is a common Spanish given name, with name day on the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar.\n\n\n=== South America ===\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Pillar and St. Raphael in Melo, Uruguay\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar, Recoleta neighbourhood, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar, Pilar, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Pillar, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei, Brazil\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the Philippines, ruled by Spain for over three hundred years, Our Lady of the Pillar is honored as the patroness of a number parishes and municipalities; seven are named Pilar in her honor.  There are towns named Pilar in the provinces of Abra, Bataan, Bohol, Capiz, Cebu, Surigao del Norte and Sorsogon.  As in Spain, her feast day is celebrated every 12 October.\n\nIn Zamboanga City, the Virgin of the Pillar has been venerated for almost four centuries as the patroness of the city and in the Archdiocese of Zamboanga. The bas relief of her atop the eastern gate of the 17th-century Spanish military fort dedicated to the Virgin, Fort Pilar (Full name: Royal Fort of our Virgin Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza, El Fuerte Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen del Pilar de Zaragoza), is now a Catholic Marian shrine. The city also has a street named after her \u2013 Pilar Street.\nIn Davao City, a shrine in honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar in Magsaysay Park was built through the collaborative efforts of Circulo Zamboangue\u00f1o de Davao, a local group of transposed from Zamboanga City.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is also the patroness of Santa Cruz parish church in the district of the same name, in the city of Manila.  The Jesuits brought the patroness when they administered the church during the Spanish era.  Her feast day is also celebrated every 12 October in the district. However, the church has its Marian procession in the 3rd week of October. The image was canonically crowned on 7 December 2017.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is the patroness of Imus, Cavite and the whole Province of Cavite, Diocese of Imus enshrined at the Imus Cathedral in Cavite province. The city celebrates its fiesta every October with the Karakol, a ritual dance-procession performed in fiestas around the province of Cavite. The image was canonically crowned on 3 December 2012.\nOur Lady of the Pillar is also the patroness, with 12 October as the feast day, in the following places:\nCity of Cauayan, Isabela.\nTown of Morong, Bataan.\nDon Rufino Alonzo Sr. Street Cotabato City Maguindanao.\nTown of Baleno, Masbate.\nTown of Pilar, Bataan.\nTown of Pilar, Bohol.\nTown of Pilar, Capiz\nTown of Pilar, Sorsogon.\nTown of San Simon, Pampanga.\nTown of Sibonga, Cebu.\nTown of Alaminos, Laguna.\nTown of Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro.\nTown & Diocese of Libmanan, Camarines Sur\nBrgy.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Cathedral of the Savior (Spanish: Catedral del Salvador) or La Seo de Zaragoza is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Zaragoza, in Aragon, Spain. It is part of the World Heritage Site Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon.\nThe cathedral is located on the Plaza de la Seo and is commonly known as La Seo (Aragonese for \"see\") to distinguish it from the nearby El Pilar, whose name (pillar) is a reference to an apparition of Mary in Zaragoza (also known as Saragossa). They both share co-cathedral status in metropolitan Zaragoza.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe location of the Seo has its roots in the old Roman forum. Unlike other Roman city forums, the forum of Caesaraugusta was not located at the confluence of the Cardus and the Decumanus, but instead near the Ebro river, adjoining the river port. The forum, besides being the civic and commercial center of the city, contained the main temple. The Museum of the Forum is found below the plaza del Pilar, across from the facade of the cathedral. There have been no remains found of either a Visigoth or a Mozarabic church. \n\n\n=== The Mosque ===\nHanas ben Abdallah as San'ani (? \u2013 718), a disciple of someone close to Mohammed, built the main mosque of Saraqusta al Baida, Zaragoza la Blanca, according to Al-\u1e24umayd\u012b (1029\u20131095). The main mosque is certainly one of the oldest of Al-Andalus. The edifice underwent two additions, one in the 9th century and one in the 11th century, under the Taifa king of Zaragoza, Mundir I. During the restoration completed in 1999, a number of remains were discovered, such as the impression of the minaret on the external walls, and the floor of the ancient structure. In addition, the entrance was located in the same place as that of the current cathedral.\nThe arrival in Zaragoza in 1118 of Alfonso I, the Battler did not lead to the immediate demolition of the mosque. He gave the Muslims one year to move out of the town, and on October 4, 1121, the building was consecrated under the name San Salvador, and the necessary renovations were made to allow the building to be used for Christian purposes.\n\n\n=== The Romanesque Cathedral ===\nThe destruction of the mosque and the construction of the Late Romanesque cathedral began in 1140. The new church, with a basilical layout consisting of a transept and three naves ending in apses, constructed of stone, owed much stylistically to the Cathedral of Jaca, from which it took various elements. Besides the church building itself, it had an archive, a refectory, a nursery, and two cloisters. From this era the lower part of two of the apses is still preserved, with small windows between inscribed capitals depicted, adorned with so-called \"checkered jaqu\u00e9s\" on the outside, and, inside, a set of sculptures that at present are hidden behind the main altarpiece.  The construction of the original cathedral continued throughout the 13th century.\nFrom 1204 up until the 15th century, all Aragonese kings were crowned in this church, by a special privilege bestowed by Pope Innocent III. The king, who the previous night had kept watch over his armaments in the Aljafer\u00eda, would approach from there in a procession. The ceremony included four parts: investiture of weapons, unction with holy oil, placing of the crown and the royal insignia, and oath of the fueros (statutes) and liberties of the Kingdom of Aragon. The last king to be crowned in La Seo was Charles I in 1518. Later kings needed only to swear to the fueros. Royal baptisms, weddings, and burials were also performed in the cathedral.\n\n\n=== The Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar Cathedral ===\n\nIn 1318 Pope John XXII created the archbishopric of Zaragoza, making it independent of the see of Tarragona, and with that the building became a metropolitan cathedral. From this point the additions were carried out using cheap materials that were found nearby in abundance: bricks and plaster. Under the supervision of the archbishop Pedro L\u00f3pez de Luna (1317\u20131345) a Gothic church with three naves (the present three central naves) was built,  keeping the Romanesque apses. The central nave was built higher than those on the sides, making it possible to create windows that from 1447 would be covered with stained glass. In 1346 a Mud\u00e9jar dome was started to provide light at the altar, with the participation of the masters Juan de Barbastro and Domingo Serrano. The work was finished in 1376,  when Don Lope Fern\u00e1ndez de Luna was already archbishop, creating a spacious, well-lit Gothic cathedral.\nIn 1360, during the archbishopric of Don Lope Fern\u00e1ndez de Luna, the main facade was renovated and the so-called Parroquieta was built, all in the Mud\u00e9jar style. The only thing that has been preserved is the Parroquieta or parochial chapel of San Miguel Archangel, that was built as a closed and independent chapel inside the building, and that archbishop Don Lope designed as a funeral chapel. The construction, elegantly carried out in Gothic-Mud\u00e9jar style, is a unique example of the work of the Aragonese masters and the Seville builders, who covered the exterior wall with geometric drawings made of smooth brick and glazed ceramic. In the interior, the roof is constructed of gilded wood, also in the Mud\u00e9jar style.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn 1403 the old dome fell down.  The Antipope Benedict XIII (Papa Luna), Aragonese by birth, initiated a reconstruction of the building.  The Romanesque apses were elevated, two towers buttressing the sides of the apses were added, and a new dome was built in the shape of a Papal Tiara.  Decorated in 1409 by the master Mohammed Rami, it may have been viewed by Benedict XIII on his visit to the city in 1410.\nThe main altarpiece was constructed during the archbishopric of Don Dalmau de Mur y Cervell\u00f3 (1431\u20131456).  Dalmau Mur concentrated on beautifying the interior of the building, taking charge of, besides the main altarpiece, the chorus and other smaller constructions.\nOn September 14, 1485, Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, the canon and head Inquisitor of Arag\u00f3n, was assassinated in the cathedral as he was praying while wearing a helmet and chain mail. This was the consequence of the bad reception that the Inquisition had in Arag\u00f3n, where it was seen as an attack by the crown on the fueros, the local laws and privileges. In particular, some of the most powerful families among the converted Jews - such as the S\u00e1nchez, Montesa, Paternoy, and Sant\u00e1ngel families -  were implicated in the assassination. As a consequence, there arose a popular movement against the Jews; \"nine were finally executed in persona, in addition to two suicides, thirteen burnings at the stake, and four punished for complicity\" according to the account of Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita. Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s was sainted by Pope Pius IX in 1867; his sepulchre, designed by Gil Morlanes the elder, is found within the cathedral in the chapel of San Pedro Arbu\u00e9s.\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, the cathedral was one of the centers of the Aragonese school of polyphonic music. Musicians Melchor Robledo, Sebasti\u00e1n Aguilera de Heredia, Pedro Ruimonte, Diego Pontac, Jus\u00e9pe Xim\u00e9nez and Andr\u00e9s de Sola, among others,  worked and composed there.\n\n\n=== Recent centuries ===\n\nThe long-standing rivalry between the canons of El Pilar and of La Seo was well known in the 17th century. The cathedral chapter of El Pilar even brought a suit to win the episcopal seat, a suit that was decided by Philip IV in favor of La Seo.  The disputes would not be resolved until, in 1676, Pope Clement X made the Solomon-like decision to merge the two chapters via the Bull of Union.  Six prebendaries and 15 canons would reside in La Seo, and the same in El Pilar, and the dean would live six months in each one.\nAlso during the 17th century, the old and decrepit Mud\u00e9jar tower was pulled down, and in 1686 construction was begun on a new one.  The new tower, which was designed in Rome in 1683 by Juan Bautista Contini in the Baroque style, was started in 1686 and  finished in 1704 with the placement of the spire.\nThe front was constructed in the 18th century in an Italian-Baroque style that was clearly of a neoclassic aspect.  It was entrusted by the Archbishop A\u00f1oa to Julian Yarza, a disciple of Ventura Rodr\u00edguez.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, a thorough restoration of the building took place, which lasted some 23 years.  The project can be divided into four stages:\n\nFrom 1975 to 1987: replacement of the six pillars of the main nave, roofs, eaves, glassworks, foundation, destruction of adjacent buildings, and archeological excavation.\nFrom 1987 to 1992: wall of the Parroquieta, dome, chapels of the head and neoclassical facade.\nFrom 1992 to 1994: completion of outside work and excavation of Roman and Muslim remnants.\nFrom 1995 to 1998: restoration of the tower, the spire and the clock, the organ, the main altarpiece; in general all the plasterwork and chapels were cleaned and restored; also the tapestry museum was renovated.In total more than two billion pesetas were spent by the Government of Aragon, the Archbishopric of Zaragoza and the Metropolitan Chapter, the Department of Education and Culture of Spain, Ibercaja, and Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada. As of 2005, the sacristy was still in the process of being restored.\n\n\n== Architectural styles ==\n\nLa Seo was built on the site of the ancient Roman forum of Augustus and of the main mosque of the Moorish city of Saraqusta, elements of whose minaret form part of the current tower. The construction began in the 12th century in the Romanesque style, and underwent many alterations and expansions until 1704, when the Baroque spire completed the tower.\nThe cathedral is a mixture of styles, from the Romanesque apse (12th century) to the Baroque tower and Neo-Classical main door (18th century), passing through Mud\u00e9jar and Gothic. Of the diverse styles that make up La Seo Cathedral, the most important elements are:\n\nRomanesque: in the exterior and the lower part of the apse. The Roman interior of the apse still remains, but is now covered by the Gothic altarpiece. In the sacristy are the \"olifante\" by Gaston IV of B\u00e9arn, built in ivory in the 11th century, and the relic-busts of Valerius of Saragossa (patron saint of Zaragoza), Saint Vincent of Saragossa, and St. Lawrence donated by the antipope Benedict XIII.\nGothic: mixed with Mud\u00e9jar, especially in the upper part of the exterior of the apse. The three central naves with their arches and tracery. Magnificent altarpiece largely of painted alabaster made by Pere Johan and Hans de Suabia. Choir stalls. Museum of Flemish tapestries from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, one of the three largest such collections in the world.\nMud\u00e9jar: exterior wall of the Parish of San Miguel and its interior roof, gilded with wood. The Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar has been named a World Heritage Site.\nRenaissance: In the Parroquieta of San Miguel, the tomb of the archbishop Don L\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez de Luna from the 16th century. Dome with Mud\u00e9jar influences, built in the first third of the 16th century to replace the older Moorish dome.\nBaroque: Tower and gate.The cathedral's museum has been restored recently and is open to  the public. It is a tapestry museum that displays one of the finest collections of tapestries in the world.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nBeginning with the foot of the cathedral, the chapels on the right side:\n\nDoor of the Pabostr\u00eda and atrium.  The interior of the door is the most interesting part.\nChapel of Our Lady of the Snows, a late Gothic chapel with Baroque altar and altar paintings by Francisco Ximeno.\nChapel of San Valero (Valerius).  Baroque entryway of gilded wood from the seventeenth century with scenes of the saints Valerius (patron of the city), Vincent, and Lawrence.  Walls were painted by Garc\u00eda Ferrer.\nChapel of Saint Helen, or the Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament.  The altar, entryway, and paintings by Francesco Lupicini of Florence are all Baroque works of the seventeenth century.\nChapel of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. The chapel was constructed by Garbriel Zaporta towards the end of the sixteenth century as a funerary chapel; only the lid of the sarcophagus has been preserved from that era. Dating from the Renaissance are altar decorations fashioned by Juan de Anchieta, bronze grating by Guill\u00e9n Trujar\u00f3n, and the doorway. The paintings and mosaics are believed to be the work of the painter Pedro Morone of Siena.\nChapel of Santo Dominguito de Val, patron saint of the Infanticos. This Baroque chapel dates back to the second half of the eighteenth century and houses the remains of the saint himself. Elliptical cupola (dome) that arches over very detailed plaster pechinas (support structures of the cupola).\nChapel of St. Augustine. Renaissance-era altar decorations by Gil Morlanes with sculptures by Gabriel Yoly and Jos\u00e9 Sanz (image of St. Augustine from 1720)\nChapel of Saint Pedro Arbu\u00e9s. On the walls appear framed paintings from the seventeenth century attributed to the artist Berdus\u00e1n. Below a canopy (pavilion-like draping of fabric) with Solomonic columns is a sculpture of Saint Pedro Arbu\u00e9s done by Juan Ram\u00edrez in the seventeenth century. Baroque doorway from the eighteenth century.Beginning with the foot of the cathedral, the chapels on the left side:\n\nChapel of St. Bernard. This is one of the greatest works of the Aragonese Renaissance. Between 1549 and 1555, it contained the tombs of the archbishop Hernando de Arag\u00f3n, who ordered its construction, along with that of his mother Ana de Gurrea. Juan Vizca\u00edno created the sepulchre of the archbishop, and Juan de Liceire did that of his mother. The altar decorations for the Chapel of San Bruno were entrusted to the sculptor Pedro de Moreto. All parts were made of alabaster. The grating is also from the Renaissance and was the work of Guill\u00e9n Trujar\u00f3n.\nChapel of St. Benedict. Commissioned in Gothic style in the sixteenth century, the construction was delayed by Hernando de Arag\u00f3n in order to collect the bodies of his servants.\nChapel of St. Mark.\nChapel of the Birth of Christ. Simple doorway from the sixteenth century. Altar decorations with panels attributed to Roland de Mois or Jer\u00f3nimo de Mora from the sixteenth century. Renaissance grating by Hernando de \u00c1vila.\nChapel of Saints Justa and Rufina. Paintings by Juan Galv\u00e1n hang over the walls. The painting of the saints was done by Francisco Camilo in 1644.\nChapel of St. Vincent. Baroque doorway. The sculpture of St. Vincent is from roughly 1760 and was created by Carlos Salas.\nChapel of St. James the Great (Santiago). A painting by Pablo Raviella from 1695. An image of St. James the pilgrim, from the 16th century, under a baroque canopy.Choir:\n\nThe choir section is formed by 117 oaken seats built by three monks named Gomar, Bernardo Giner, and Mateo de Cambiay. It is enclosed by a bronze grating accented with sculptures of gilded wood by Juan Ram\u00edrez. The archbishop Dalmau Mir is buried here.\nThe organ preserves some remnants of the Gothic organ of 1469 and pipes hailing from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. The present-day organ is the result of the integration of the complex historical pieces of the instrument, done between 1857 and 1859 by Pedro Roqu\u00e9s.\nTo the rear of the choir lies the chapel of the Holy Christ, with a representation of the crucified Christ, Mater Dolorosa (Mary) and St. John created by Arnau de Bruselas near the end of the sixteenth century; all of this is below a canopy supported by Solomonic columns of black marble. The decorations are the work of Jer\u00f3nimo Vallejo, Arnau de Bruselas, and Juan Sanz de Tudelilla, done in hardened plaster, and they form one of the most notable groups of sculpture from the Aragonese Renaissance. To the sides lie the small chapels of St. Martha, St. Matthew, St. John the Baptist, St. Thomas of Villanova, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Merced, Saint Leonard of Noblac, Saint Philip Neri, and Saint Orosia.Apses:\n\nChapel of the Virgen Blanca (White Virgin). Baroque altar decorations of wood with paintings by Jusepe Mart\u00ednez (1647), a painter from Zaragoza. Alabaster sculpture of the Virgin with child from the fifteenth century made by the French sculptor Fortaner de Uesques. On the floor lie various tombstones of the archbishops of Zaragoza from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\nMain altar decorations. Dedicated to the Savior, it was originally created in alabaster and painted by various artists from 1434 to 1480, most notably Pere Johan, Francisco Gomar, and Hans Piet D'anso. It can be considered one of the greatest works of European Gothic sculpture.\nChapel of St. Peter and St. Paul. Altar decorations of gilded wood with relief scenes of the lives of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCatholic Church in Spain\nAljafer\u00eda\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the Spanish-language Wikipedia, which was accessed in the version of 21 February 2006.\nLostal Pros, Joaqu\u00edn; Arturo Ans\u00f3n Navarro (2001).

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators.

        "wiki": "Pablo Emilio or Pau Emili Gargallo Catal\u00e1n (5 January 1881 \u2013 28 December 1934), known simply as Pau or Pablo Gargallo, was a Spanish sculptor and painter.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Maella, Aragon, he moved to Barcelona, Catalonia, with his family in 1888, where he would begin his training in the arts. Gargallo developed a style of sculpture based on the creation of three-dimensional objects from pieces of flat metal plate, and he also used paper or cardboard. Some of these sculptures have a form of cubism. For example, only one half of a face may be shown, and it may have only one eye. He also made more traditional sculptures in bronze, marble and other materials. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the town of ralls Aragonese avant-garde.\n\nHe spent a significant part of his life in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. In 1903, he invested a studio at the Cit\u00e9 d'Artistes, rue Vercing\u00e9torix in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. There he met Max Jacob and Carlos Casagemas, both friends of Pablo Picasso.In 1907, he stayed at the artists commune Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre with Max Jacob, Juan Gris and other artists. He spent his first night in the studio of his friend Picasso, whose head he modeled as a sculpture. There he was able to contemplate Picasso's seminal proto-Cubist painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Shortly thereafter, Juan Gris introduced him to Magali Tartanson, whom he married in 1915. During this period, Gargallo was influenced by the work of Picasso.\nAmong Gargallo's works are three pieces based on Greta Garbo: \"Masque de Greta Garbo \u00e0 la m\u00e8che,\" \"T\u00eate de Greta Garbo avec chapeau,\" and \"Masque de Greta Garbo aux cils.\"\nTogether with D\u00eddac Masana, Gargallo sculpted the great arch over the front of the stage of the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in Barcelona. The work depicts the Ride of the Valkyries in Richard Wagner's opera Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyries).\nGargallo suffered from fulminating bronchial pneumonia and died in Reus, Tarragona. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the Spanish avant-garde, and in 1985 the Pablo Gargallo Museum in Zaragoza opened in the former Argillo Palace. Gargallo's birthplace and early home, on the street now dedicated to his name in Maella, Zaragosa, has been transformed into a museum dedicated to his life and works.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nP.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields.

Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "Mud\u00e9jar architecture of Aragon is an aesthetic trend in the Mud\u00e9jar style, which is centered in Aragon (Spain) and has been recognized in some representative buildings as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nThe chronology of the Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar occupies 12th to the 17th century and includes more than a hundred architectural monuments located predominantly in the valleys of the Ebro, Jal\u00f3n and Jiloca.\nThe first manifestations of Aragonese Mud\u00e9jar have two origins: on the one hand, a palatial architecture linked to the monarchy, which amends and extends the Aljafer\u00eda Palace maintaining Islamic ornamental tradition, and on the other hand, a tradition which develops Romanesque architecture using brickwork rather than masonry construction and which often displays Hispanic-rooted ornamental tracery. Examples of the latter type of Mud\u00e9jar architecture can be seen in churches in Daroca, which were started in stone and finished off in the 13th century with Mud\u00e9jar brick panels.\nFrom the construction point of view, the Mud\u00e9jar architecture in Aragon preferably adopts functional schemes of Cistercian Gothic, but with some differences. Buttresses are often absent, especially in the apses which characteristically have an octagonal floor plan with thick walls that can hold the thrust from the roof and which provide space to highlight brick decorations. On the other hand, buttresses are often a feature of the naves, where they may be topped by turrets, as in the style of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar. There may be side chapels which are not obvious from the exterior. Churches in neighborhoods (such as San Pablo of Zaragoza) or small towns do not usually have aisles, but locations for additional altars are provided by chapels between the nave buttresses. It is common for these side chapels to have a closed gallery or \u00e1ndite (walkway), with windows looking to the outside and inside of the building. This constitution is called a church-fortress, and his prototype could be the church of Montalb\u00e1n.\nTypically the bell towers show extraordinary ornamental development, the structure being inherited from the Islamic minaret: quadrangular with central pier whose spaces are filled via a staircase approximation vaults, as in the Almohad minarets. On this body stood the tower, usually polygonal. There are also examples of octagonal towers.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\n\nIn 1986, Unesco declared the whole Mud\u00e9jar complex of Teruel a World Heritage Site, which was extended in 2001 to include other Aragonese Mudejar monuments:\n\nThe description of the importance given so appropriated:\n\nThe development in the twelfth century Mudejar art in Aragon is a consequence of the political, social and cultural conditions that prevailed in Spain after the Reconquista.

        "wiki": "The Church of Santa Engracia de Zaragoza is a basilica church in Zaragoza, Spain.  It was built on the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred in 303 AD. The Basilica of Santa Engracia is located at Plaza de Santa Engracia. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Basilica of Santa Engracia is believed to have been built on the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred in 303 AD. Early in the fourth century, a tomb was built on the site of the Christian-Roman necropolis. Around 609 the Abbey of Santa Engracia was established to house the relics of Saint Engratia and the many martyrs of Saragossa.The Abbey was demolished around 1492 when Ferdinand II of Aragon founded the Hieronymus monastery of Santa Engracia. After his election to the papacy, Pope Hadrian VI passed through Zaragoza on his way to Rome, spending Holy Week at Santa Egratia. King Philip III visited in 1599.\nThe monastery church was largely destroyed in the Siege of Saragossa (1809) during the Spanish War of Independence, with only the crypt and the facade being left.Pope John Paul II honored the church with the designation of a minor basilica on the occasion of his visit in 1982.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe fa\u00e7ade was begun around 1511 by Gil Morlanes El Viejo and completed by his son five years later.  It was modified between 1754-1759 after part of the church collapsed. Part of the fa\u00e7ade is all that remains of the monastery church, when the present building was constructed between 1891-1899.\nThe most significant elements of the crypt are the two Early Christian sarcophagi of the fourth century, which were discovered in 1737.  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "Francisco Franco Bahamonde (, Spanish: [f\u027ean\u02c8\u03b8isko \u02c8f\u027ea\u014bko]; 4 December 1892 \u2013 20 November 1975) was a Spanish general who led the Nationalist forces in overthrowing the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War and thereafter ruled over Spain from 1939 to 1975 as a dictator, assuming the title Caudillo. This period in Spanish history, from the Nationalist victory to Franco's death, is commonly known as Francoist Spain or the Francoist dictatorship. \nBorn in Ferrol, Spain into an upper-class military family, Franco served in the Spanish Army as a cadet in the Toledo Infantry Academy from 1907 to 1910. While serving in Morocco, he rose through the ranks to become brigadier general in 1926, aged 33, becoming the youngest general in Spain. Two years later Franco became the director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. As a conservative and monarchist, Franco regretted the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the Republican Army. His career redoubled after the right-wing CEDA and PRR won the 1933 election empowering him to lead the suppression of the 1934 uprising in Asturias. Franco was briefly elevated to Chief of Army Staff before the 1936 election moved the leftist Popular Front into power, relegating him to the Canary Islands. After initial reluctance, he joined the July 1936 military coup which, after failing to take Spain, sparked the Spanish Civil War.\nDuring the war, he commandeered Spain's colonial army in Africa and after the death of much of the rebel leadership became his faction's only leader, later appointed Generalissimo and Head of State in 1936. He consolidated all nationalist parties into the FET y de las JONS (creating a one-party state). Three years later the Nationalists declared victory which extended Franco's dictatorship over Spain through a period of repression of political opponents. His dictatorship's use of forced labor, concentration camps, and executions led to between 30,000 and 50,000 deaths. Combined with wartime killings, this brings the death toll of the White Terror to between 100,000 and 200,000. In post-civil-war Spain, Franco ruled with more power than any Spanish leader before or since, and developed a cult of personality around his rule by founding the Movimiento Nacional.  During World War II he maintained Spanish neutrality but supported the Axis \u2014 whose members Italy and Germany had supported him during the Civil War \u2014 in various ways, damaging the country's international reputation.\nDuring the start of the Cold War, Franco lifted Spain out of its mid-20th century economic depression through technocratic and economically liberal policies, presiding over a period of rampant growth known as the \"Spanish miracle\". At the same time, his regime transitioned from being totalitarian to authoritarian with limited pluralism and became a leader in the anti-Communist movement, garnering support from the West, particularly the United States. The dictatorship softened and Luis Carrero Blanco became Franco's \u00e9minence grise.  Carrero Blanco's role expanded after Franco started struggling with Parkinson's disease in the 1960s. In 1973 Franco resigned as prime minister \u2013 separated from the head of state office since 1967 \u2013 due to advanced age and illness, but remained in power as the latter and commander-in-chief. Franco died in 1975, aged 82, and was entombed in the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos. He restored the monarchy in his final years, being succeeded by Juan Carlos as King of Spain, who, in turn, led the Spanish transition to democracy.\nThe legacy of Franco in Spanish history remains controversial as the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved highly adaptable, which enabled wide-sweeping social and economic reform, while consistent pursuits during his reign centered on highly centralised government, authoritarianism, nationalism, national Catholicism, anti-freemasonry, and anti-communism.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFrancisco Franco Bahamonde was born on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in the province of El Ferrol, Galicia. He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo; Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the saint day of his birth. Franco was born into a seafaring family of Andalusian ancestry.\n\nAfter relocating to Galicia, the family was involved in the Spanish Navy, and over the span of two centuries produced naval officers for six uninterrupted generations (including several admirals), down to Franco's father Nicol\u00e1s Franco y Salgado Ara\u00fajo (22 November 1855 \u2013 22 February 1942).His mother, Mar\u00eda del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (15 October 1865 \u2013 28 February 1934), was from an upper-middle-class Roman Catholic family. Her father, Ladislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port of El Ferrol. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in El Ferrol. The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, Nicol\u00e1s and Ram\u00f3n, and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar and Mar\u00eda de la Paz. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was naval officer and diplomat who  married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello. Ram\u00f3n was an internationally known aviator, a Freemason originally with leftist political leanings. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.Franco's father was a naval officer who reached the rank of vice admiral (intendente general). When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid following a reassignment and ultimately abandoned his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel Raza under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the Spanish\u2013American War the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the Spanish Army. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in Toledo. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average; though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests, his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming in at position 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel. At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912. Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African protectorate provoked the Second Melillan campaign in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of Riffian rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish military officers, and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either la caja o la faja (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer.  In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed regulares: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as shock troops. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n. The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.\nIn 1916, aged 23 as a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at El Biutz. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only one testicle. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.His recovery was seen by native troops in Africa as a spiritual event \u2013 they believed Franco to be blessed with baraka, or protected by God. He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted Cruz Laureada de San Fernando. Both proposals were denied citing the 23-year-old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead Franco received the Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class.With that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray, a histrionic but charismatic officer, founded the Spanish Foreign Legion, on similar lines as the French Foreign Legion. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the Rif War, on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered a crushing defeat at Annual from the Republic of the Rif led by the Abd el-Krim brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of Melilla after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a lieutenant colonel, he was made commander of the Legion.\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988). Following his honeymoon Franco was summoned to Madrid to be presented to King Alfonso XIII. This and other occasions of royal attention would mark him during the Republic as a monarchical officer. \nDisappointed with the plans for a strategic retreat from the interior to the African coastline by Primo de Rivera, Franco wrote in April 1924 for Revista de Tropas Coloniales that he would disobey orders of retreat from a superior. He also held a tense meeting with Primo de Rivera in July 1924. According to fellow africanista, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, Franco visited him on 21 September 1924 to propose him to lead a coup d'etat against Primo. Yet, at the end, Franco orderly complied, taking part in the retreat of Spanish soldiers from Xaouen in late 1924, and thus he earned a promotion to Colonel.Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at Al Hoceima (Spanish: Alhucemas) in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived Republic of the Rif. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him, and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with Major-General Joe Sweeney of the Irish Army, one of the youngest generals in Europe. On 14 September 1926, Franco and Polo had a daughter, Mar\u00eda del Carmen. Franco would have a close relationship with his daughter and was a proud parent, though his traditionalist attitudes and increasing responsibilities meant he left much of the child-rearing to his wife. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army cadets, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of 12 April 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain, but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals. The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the Second Spanish Republic. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic. But the closing of the Academy in June by the provisional War Minister Manuel Aza\u00f1a was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the Spanish Republic. Aza\u00f1a found Franco's farewell speech to the cadets insulting. In his speech Franco stressed the Republic's need for discipline and respect. Aza\u00f1a entered an official reprimand into Franco's personnel file and for six months Franco was without a post and under surveillance.In December 1931, a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. It included strong provisions enforcing a broad secularisation of the Catholic country, which included the abolishing of Catholic schools and charities, which many moderate committed Catholics opposed. At this point once the constituent assembly had fullfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned. Fearing the increasing popular opposition, the Radical and Socialist majority postponed the regular elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the republican government of Manuel Aza\u00f1a initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would \"modernize\" the country.Franco was a subscriber to the journal of Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, a monarchist organisation, and a firm believer in a supposed Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik conspiracy, or contubernio (filthy cohabitation).  The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.\n\nOn 5 February 1932, Franco was given a command in A Coru\u00f1a. Franco avoided involvement in Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo's attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the Balearic Islands. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted.\nIn 1932 the Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were banned and had all their property confiscated. The army was further reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own.  In June 1933 Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical Dilectissima Nobis, \"On Oppression of the Church of Spain\", raising his voice against the persecution of the Catholic Church in Spain.The elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president Alcal\u00e1-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the Radical Republican Party's Alejandro Lerroux to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year. After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. The entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left.  The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months. A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the Alianza Obrera. The issue was that the Left Republicans identified the Republic not with democracy or constitutional law but a specific set of left-wing policies and politicians. Any deviation, even if democratic, was seen as treasonous. A Catalan state was proclaimed by Catalan nationalist leader Lluis Companys, but it lasted just ten hours. Despite an attempt at a general stoppage in Madrid, other strikes did not endure. This left Asturian strikers to fight alone.In several mining towns in Asturias, local unions gathered small arms and were determined to see the strike through. It began on the evening of 4 October, with the miners occupying several towns, attacking and seizing local Civil and Assault Guard barracks. Thirty four priests, six young seminarists with ages between 18 and 21, and several businessmen and civil guards were summarily executed by the revolutionaries in Mieres and Sama, 58 religious buildings including churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo were burned and destroyed. Franco, already General of Division and aide to the war minister, Diego Hidalgo, was put in command of the operations directed to suppress the violent insurgency. Troops of the Spanish Army of Africa carried this out, with General Eduardo L\u00f3pez Ochoa as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed.\nThe insurgency in Asturias sparked a new era of violent anti-Christian persecutions, initiated the practice of atrocities against the clergy, and sharpened the antagonism between Left and Right. Franco and L\u00f3pez Ochoa (who, prior to the campaign in Asturias, had been seen as a left-leaning officer) emerged as officers prepared to use \"troops against Spanish civilians as if they were a foreign enemy\". Franco described the rebellion to a journalist in Oviedo as, \"a frontier war and its fronts are socialism, communism and whatever attacks civilisation to replace it with barbarism.\" Though the colonial units sent to the north by the government at Franco's recommendation consisted of the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Moroccan Regulares Indigenas, the right-wing press portrayed the Asturian rebels as lackeys of a foreign Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.With this rebellion against established political legitimate authority, the Socialists showed identical repudiation of representative institutional system that anarchists had practiced. The Spanish historian Salvador de Madariaga, an Aza\u00f1a supporter, and an exiled vocal opponent of Francisco Franco is the author of a sharp critical reflection against the participation of the left in the revolt: \u201cThe uprising of 1934 is unforgivable. The argument that Mr Gil Robles tried to destroy the Constitution to establish fascism was, at once, hypocritical and false. With the rebellion of 1934, the Spanish left lost even the shadow of moral authority to condemn the rebellion of 1936.\u201d At the start of the Civil War, L\u00f3pez Ochoa was assassinated. Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from 15 February onwards), and from 19 May 1935, on, Chief of the General Staff.\n\n\n==== 1936 general election ====\n\nIn the end of 1935 President Alcal\u00e1-Zamora manipulated a petty-corruption issue into a major scandal in parliament, and eliminated Alejandro Lerroux, the head of the Radical Republican Party, from premiership. Subsequently, Alcal\u00e1-Zamora vetoed the logical replacement, a majority center-right coalition, led by the CEDA, which would reflect the composition of the parliament. He then arbitrarily appointed an interim prime minister and after a short period announced the dissolution of parliament and new elections.Two wide coalitions formed: the Popular Front on the left, ranging from Republican Union to Communists, and the Frente Nacional on the right, ranging from the centre radicals to the conservative Carlists. On 16 February 1936 the elections ended in a virtual draw, but in the evening leftist mobs started to interfere in the balloting and in the registration of votes distorting the results.  Stanley G. Payne claims that the process was a major electoral fraud, with widespread violation of the laws and the constitution. In line with Payne's point of view, in 2017 two Spanish scholars, Manuel \u00c1lvarez Tard\u00edo and Roberto Villa Garc\u00eda published the result of a major research work where they concluded that the 1936 elections were rigged.On 19 February the cabinet presided by Portela Valladares resigned, with a new cabinet being quickly set up, composed chiefly of members of the Republican Left and the Republican Union and presided by Manuel Aza\u00f1a.Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo, who acquired anti-communism as the axis of his parliamentary speeches, became the speaker of violent propaganda\u2014advocating for a military coup d'\u00e9tat; formulating a catastrophist discourse of a dichotomous choice between \"communism\" or a markedly totalitarian \"National\" State, setting the mood of the masses for a military rebellion. The diffusion of the myth about an alleged Communist coup d'\u00e9tat as well a pretended state of \"social chaos\" became pretexts for a coup. Franco himself along with General Emilio Mola had stirred an Anti-Communist campaign in Morocco.At the same time PSOE's left-wing socialists became more radical. Julio \u00c1lvarez del Vayo talked about \"Spain's being converted into a socialist Republic in association with the Soviet Union\". Francisco Largo Caballero declared that \"the organized proletariat will carry everything before it and destroy everything until we reach our goal\". The country rapidly descended into anarchy. Even the staunch socialist Indalecio Prieto, at a party rally in Cuenca in May 1936, complained: \"we have never seen so tragic a panorama or so great a collapse as in Spain at this moment. Abroad Spain is classified as insolvent. This is not the road to socialism or communism but to desperate anarchism without even the advantage of liberty\".On 23 February Franco was sent to the Canary Islands to serve as the islands' military commander, an appointment perceived by him as a destierro (banishment). Meanwhile, a conspiracy led by General Mola was taking shape.\nInterested in the parliamentary immunity granted by a seat at the Cortes, Franco intended to stand as candidate of the Right Bloc alongside Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera for the by-election in the province of Cuenca programmed for 3 May 1936, after the results of the February 1936 election were annulled in the constituency. But Primo de Rivera refused to run alongside a military officer (and Franco in particular) and Franco himself ultimately desisted on 26 April, one day before the decision of the election authority. By that time, PSOE politician Indalecio Prieto already deemed Franco as \"possible caudillo for a military uprising\".The disenchantment with Aza\u00f1a's ruling continued to grow and was dramatically voiced by Miguel de Unamuno, a republican and one of Spain's most respected intellectuals, who in June 1936 told a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto that President Manuel Aza\u00f1a should \"commit suicide as a patriotic act\".In June 1936, Franco was contacted and a secret meeting was held within La Esperanza forest on Tenerife to discuss starting a military coup. An obelisk commemorating this historic meeting was erected at the site in a clearing at Las Ra\u00edces.Outwardly, Franco maintained an ambiguous attitude until nearly July. On 23 June 1936, he wrote to the head of the government, Casares Quiroga, offering to quell the discontent in the Spanish Republican Army, but received no reply. The other rebels were determined to go ahead con Paquito o sin Paquito (with Paquito or without Paquito; Paquito being a diminutive of Paco, which in turn is short for Francisco), as it was put by Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo, the honorary leader of the military uprising. After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising. The situation reached a point of no return and, as presented to Franco by Mola, the coup was unavoidable and he had to choose a side. He decided to join the rebels and was given the task of commanding the Army of Africa. A privately owned DH 89 De Havilland Dragon Rapide, flown by two British pilots, Cecil Bebb and Hugh Pollard, was chartered in England on 11 July to take Franco to Africa.\nThe coup underway was precipitated by the assassination of the right-wing opposition leader Calvo Sotelo in retaliation for the murder of assault guard Jos\u00e9 Castillo, which had been committed by a group headed by a civil guard and composed of assault guards and members of the socialist militias. On 17 July, one day earlier than planned, the Army of Africa rebelled, detaining their commanders. On 18 July, Franco published a manifesto and left for Africa, where he arrived the next day to take command.\nA week later the rebels, who soon called themselves the Nationalists, controlled a third of Spain; most naval units remained under control of the Republican loyalist forces, which left Franco isolated. The coup had failed in the attempt to bring a swift victory, but the Spanish Civil War had begun. The revolt was remarkably devoid of any particular ideology. The major goal was to put an end to anarchical disorder. Franco himself certainly detested communism, but had no commitment to any ideology: his stand was motivated not by foreign fascism but by Spanish tradition and patriotism.\n\n\n== From the Spanish Civil War to World War II ==\n\nThe Spanish Civil War began in July 1936 and officially ended with Franco's victory in April 1939, leaving 190,000 to 500,000 dead. Despite the Non-Intervention Agreement of August 1936, the war was marked by foreign intervention on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by Fascist Italy, which sent the Corpo Truppe Volontarie, and later by Nazi Germany, which assisted with the Condor Legion. They were opposed by the Soviet Union and communists, socialists, and anarchists within Spain. The United Kingdom and France strictly adhered to the arms embargo, provoking dissensions within the French Popular Front coalition which was led by L\u00e9on Blum, but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the International Brigades (see for example Ken Loach's Land and Freedom).\nSome historians, such as Ernst Nolte, have considered that Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin used the Spanish Civil war as a testing ground for modern warfare, being quickly set up and that the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a European Civil War which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a left/right ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (See Spanish Civil War: other factions) and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of Spanish history.\n\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 pronunciamiento, Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the Spanish Army of Africa. The first days of the insurgency were marked by a serious need to secure control over the Spanish Moroccan Protectorate. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco. Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the Iberian Peninsula, since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the Strait of Gibraltar. He requested help from Benito Mussolini, who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German Junkers Ju 52 aircraft, to initiate an air bridge to Seville, where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in Tetouan on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\nOn the Republican side, in 26 July, just eight days after the revolt had started, an international communist conference was held at Prague to arrange plans to help the Republican Government. It decide to raise an international brigade of 5,000 men and a fund of 1 billion francs to be administered by a commission where Largo Caballero and Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri had prominent roles. At the same time communist parties throughout the world quickly launched a full scale propaganda campaign in support of the Popular Front. The Communist International immediately reinforced its activity, sending to Spain its leader Georgi Dimitrov, and Palmiro Togliatti the chief of the Communist Party of Italy. From August onward, aid from the Soviet Union began; over one ship per day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery, trucks. With the cargo came Soviet agents, technicians, instructors and propagandists.The Communist International immediately started to organize the International Brigades with great care to conceal or minimize the communist character of the enterprise and to make it appear as a campaign on behalf of progressive democracy. Attractive misleading names were deliberately chosen, such as \"Garibaldi\" in Italy or \"Abraham Lincoln\" in the United States.In early August, the situation in western Andalusia was stable enough to allow Franco to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Yag\u00fce, which would march through Extremadura towards Madrid. On 11 August M\u00e9rida was taken, and on 15 August Badajoz, thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV) of fully motorised units (some 12,000 Italians), to Seville, and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the Luftwaffe (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days was the Italian SM.79 and SM.81 bombers, the biplane Fiat CR.32 fighter and the German Junkers Ju 52 cargo-bomber and the Heinkel He 51 biplane fighter.\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of Maqueda (some 80 km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo, which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the Popular Front time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support. Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrived as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments. Soviet officers were in effective charge of military operations on the Madrid front. Kennan believes that this operation was originally conducted in good faith with no other purpose than saving the Republic. Effort was made to encourage the Spanish Communist Party to seize power, but the holding of Alc\u00e1zar was an important morale and propaganda success for the Nationalists, because it is clear that Hitler's primary aim was not a Franco victory but to prolong the war by the active intervention of the Soviet Government as well as that of Italy, Britain, and France in the Civil War.Hitler's policy for Spain was shrewd and pragmatic. His instructions were clear: \"A hundred per cent Franco's victory was not desirable from a German Point of view; rather were we interested in a continuance of the war and in the keeping up of the tension in the Mediterranean.\" Hitler wanted to help Franco just enough to gain his gratitude and to prevent the side supported by the Soviet Union from winning, but not large enough to give the Caudillo a quick victory.By February 1937 the Soviet Union's military help started to taper off, to be replaced by limited economic aid. A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation;  the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism, and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is that Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco. Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a Soviet general, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the general returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots, and tanks to bring about a speedy victory over Franco, but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"it would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The general who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.\n\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo, died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash. In the nationalist zone, \"political life ceased.\" Initially, only military command mattered: this was divided into regional commands (Emilio Mola in the North, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano in Seville commanding Andalusia, Franco with an independent command, and Miguel Cabanellas in Zaragoza commanding Aragon). The Spanish Army of Morocco was itself split into two columns, one commanded by General Juan Yag\u00fce and the other commanded by Colonel Jos\u00e9 Varela.\nFrom 24 July a coordinating junta was established, based at Burgos. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general, it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August. On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas), and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government. He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.Mola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the Carlist monarchists and not at all with the Falange, a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera), nor did he have good relations with Germany. Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles, and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in Alicante (he would be executed a few months later). The desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state. Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and he had also cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy.On 1 October 1936, in Burgos, Franco was publicly proclaimed as General\u00edsimo of the National army and Jefe del Estado (Head of State). When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later on 2 June 1937 (which some believe was an assassination), no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935.\n\n\n=== Military command ===\n\nFranco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war. Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy. After the failed assault on Madrid in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to relieve the garrison at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate: some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for Valencia instead of Catalonia, remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite not always being effective, were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the Condor Legion, but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.The Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:\nthe reckless policies of the Popular Front government in the weeks prior to the war, where it ignored potential dangers and alienated the opposition, encouraging more people to join the rebellion,\nthe Nationalists' superior military cohesion,\nFranco's own leadership, which helped unify the various Nationalist factions, as well as his diplomatic skill, which helped the Nationalists secure military aid from Italy and Germany and keep democracies such as Britain and France out of the war,\nthe Nationalists' effective use of a smaller navy: the Nationalists acquired the most powerful ships in the Spanish fleet and maintained an effective officer corp, while the Republican sailors often liquidated their officers. They used their ships aggressively to hunt down the opposition, whilst the Republicans had a largely passive naval strategy,\nthe greater foreign aid during the war, as well as more efficient use of foreign aid and effective augmentation of Nationalist forces with captured arms and soldiers from the Republicans,\nthe more efficient mobilisation of economic assets,\nthe successful integration of a substantial portion of Republican prisoners-of war-into the Nationalist army (proportionately one the greatest out of any army in any 20th-century European civil war),\nthe Republican disunity and infighting at multiple levels,\nthe destructive consequences of the revolution in the Republican zone: mobilisation was impeded, the Republican image was harmed abroad in democracies, and the war against religion crystallised massive and unremitting Catholic support for the Nationalists,\nthe Nationalists ability to build a larger air force and more effective use of their air force, particularly in supporting ground operations and bombing; the Nationalists also generally enjoyed air superiority from mid-1937 onwards.\n\n\n=== Political command ===\nThe Nazis were disappointed with Franco's resistance to installing fascism. Historian James S. Corum states:\n\nAs an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n\nWhereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.\nFrom 1937 to 1948 the Franco regime was a hybrid as Franco fused the ideologically incompatible national-syndicalist Falange (\"Phalanx\", a fascist Spanish political party founded by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera) and the Carlist monarchist parties into one party under his rule, dubbed Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (FET y de las JONS), which became the only legal party in 1939. Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\". In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points. Franco made himself jefe nacional (National Chief) of the new FET (Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime. In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\" The Falangists' hymn, Cara al Sol, became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er, who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists (Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9) and the Falangists (Manuel Hedilla) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' anti-clericalism in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"Martyrs of the war\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism\".\n\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see History of Madrid) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February Chamberlain's Britain and Daladier's France officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"fifth column\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, Valencia, which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and vowed to never take it up again unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.\nAlthough Germany had recognised the Franco Government, Franco's policy towards Germany was extremely cautious until spectacular German victories at the beginning of the Second World War. An early indication that Franco was going to keep his distance from Germany soon proved true. A rumoured state visit by Franco to Germany did not take place and a further rumour of a visit by Goering to Spain, after he had enjoyed a cruise in the Western Mediterranean, again did not materialise. Instead Goering had to return to Berlin. This proved how right Eden was when he said \"Whatever the final outcome of the strife ... the Spanish people will continue to display that proud independence, that arrogant individualism which is a characteristic of the race. There are twenty-four million reasons why Spain will never for long be dominated by the forces or controlled by the advice of any foreign power.\"During the Civil War and in the aftermath, a period known as the White Terror took place. This saw mass executions of Republican and other Nationalist enemies, standing in contrast to the war-time Red Terror. Historical analysis and investigations estimate the number of executions by the Franco regime during this time to be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead.\nStanley G. Payne approximates 50,000 executions by the Republicans and at least 70,000 executions by the Nationalists during the civil war, with the victory being followed by a further 30,000 executions by the Nationalists. Recent searches conducted with parallel excavations of mass graves in Spain (in particular by the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, ARMH) estimate the total of people executed after the civil war between 15,000 and 35,000.Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz, nominated in 2008 among the experts in the first judicial investigation (conducted by judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n) against the Francoist crimes, as well as historians Josep Fontana and Hugh Thomas, estimate the deaths in the White Terror to be around 150,000 in total. According to Paul Preston, 150,000 wartime civilian executions took place in the Francoist area, as well as 50,000 in the Republican area, in addition to 20,000 civilians executed by the Franco regime after the end of the war. According to Helen Graham, the Spanish working classes became to the Francoist project what the Jews were to the German Volksgemeinschaft.According to Gabriel Jackson and Antony Beevor, the number of victims of the \"White Terror\" (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) only between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000. Beevor \"reckons Franco's ensuing 'white terror' claimed 200,000 lives. The 'red terror' had already killed 38,000.\" Julius Ruiz concludes that \"although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain.\"\n\nDespite the end of the war, guerrilla resistance to Franco, known as \"the Maquis\", occurred in the Pyrenees, carrying out sabotage and robberies against the Francoist regime. Several exiled Republicans also fought in the French resistance against the German occupation in Vichy France during World War II. In 1944, a group of republican veterans from the French resistance invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were quickly defeated. The activities of the Maquis continued well into the 1950s.\nThe end of the war led to hundreds of thousands of exiles, mostly to France, but also to Mexico, Chile, Cuba, and the United States. On the other side of the Pyrenees, refugees were confined in internment camps in France, such as Camp Gurs or Camp Vernet, where 12,000 Republicans were housed in squalid conditions (mostly soldiers from the Durruti Division). The 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs were divided into four categories: Brigadists, pilots, Gudaris and ordinary \"Spaniards\". The Gudaris (Basques) and the pilots easily found local backers and jobs, and were allowed to quit the camp, but the farmers and ordinary people, who could not find relations in France, were encouraged by the French government, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in Ir\u00fan. From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for \"purification\" according to the Law of Political Responsibilities.\nAfter the proclamation by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain of the Vichy France regime, the refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other \"undesirables\", they were sent to the Drancy internment camp before being deported to Nazi Germany. 5,000 Spaniards thus died in Mauthausen concentration camp. The Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, who had been named by the Chilean President Pedro Aguirre Cerda special consul for immigration in Paris, was given responsibility for what he called \"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\": shipping more than 2,000 Spanish refugees, who had been housed by the French in squalid camps, to Chile on an old cargo ship, the Winnipeg.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nIn September 1939 World War II began. On 23 October 1940, Hitler and Franco met in Hendaye in France to discuss the possibility of Spain's entry on the side of the Axis. Franco's demands, including supplies of food and fuel, as well as Spanish control of Gibraltar and French North Africa, proved too much for Hitler. At the time Hitler did not want to risk damaging his relations with the new Vichy French government. (An oft-cited remark attributed to Hitler is that the German leader said that he would rather have some of his own teeth extracted than to have to personally deal further with Franco.) Franco had received important support from Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini during the Spanish Civil War, and he had signed the Anti-Comintern Pact. He described Spain as part of the Axis in official documents, while offering various kinds of support to Italy and Germany. He allowed Spanish soldiers to volunteer to fight in the German Army against the Soviet Union (the Blue Division), but forbade Spaniards to fight in the West against the democracies. Franco's common ground with Hitler was particularly weakened by Hitler's propagation of Nazi mysticism and his attempts to manipulate Christianity, which went against Franco's fervent commitment to defending Catholicism. Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands he knew Hitler would not accede to, in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that Franco, as the leader of a destroyed and bankrupt country in chaos following a brutal three-year civil war, simply had little to offer the Axis and that the Spanish armed forces were not ready for a major war. It has also been suggested that Franco decided not to join the war after the resources he requested from Hitler in October 1940 were not forthcoming.According to some scholars, after the Fall of France in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis stance (for example, German and Italian ships and U-boats were allowed to use Spanish naval facilities) before returning to a more neutral position in late 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against the Axis Powers, and Italy had changed sides. Franco was initially keen to join the war before the UK was defeated.In the winter of 1940\u201341 Franco toyed with the idea of a \"Latin Bloc\" formed by Spain, Portugal, Vichy France, the Vatican and Italy, without much consequence. Franco had cautiously decided to enter the war on the Axis side in June 1940, and to prepare his people for war, an anti-British and anti-French campaign was launched in the Spanish media that demanded French Morocco, Cameroon and Gibraltar. On 19 June 1940, Franco pressed along a message to Hitler saying he wanted to enter the war, but Hitler was annoyed at Franco's demand for the French colony of Cameroon, which had been German before World War I, and which Hitler was planning on taking back for Plan Z. Franco seriously considered blocking allied access to the Mediterranean Sea by invading British-held Gibraltar, but he abandoned the idea after learning that the plan would have likely failed due to Gibraltar being too heavily defended. In addition, declaring war on the UK and its allies would no doubt give them an  opportunity to capture both the Canary Islands and Spanish Morocco, as well as possibly launch an invasion of mainland Spain itself. Franco was aware that his air force would be defeated if going into action against the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy would be able to blockade Spain to prevent imports of crucial materials such as oil. Spain depended on oil imports from the United States, which were almost certain to be cut off if Spain formally joined the Axis. Franco and Serrano Su\u00f1er held a meeting with Mussolini and Ciano in Bordighera, Italy on 12 February 1941. Mussolini affected not to be interested in Franco's help due to the defeats his forces had suffered in North Africa and the Balkans, and he even told Franco that he wished he could find any way to leave the war. When the invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941, Franco's foreign minister Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er immediately suggested the formation of a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion. Volunteer Spanish troops (the Divisi\u00f3n Azul, or \"Blue Division\") fought on the Eastern Front under German command from 1941 to 1944. Some historians have argued that not all of the Blue Division were true volunteers and that Franco expended relatively small but significant resources to aid the Axis powers' battle against the Soviet Union.\nFranco was initially disliked by Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, who, during World War II, suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American declaration of war on Spain to overthrow Franco's regime. Hitler may not have really wanted Spain to join the war, as he needed neutral harbors to import materials from countries in Latin America and elsewhere. In addition Hitler felt Spain would be a burden as it would be dependent on Germany for help. By 1941 Vichy French forces were proving their effectiveness in North Africa, reducing the need for Spanish help, and Hitler was wary about opening up a new front on the western coast of Europe as he struggled to reinforce the Italians in Greece and Yugoslavia. Franco signed a revised Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. Spain continued to import war materials and trade wolfram with Germany until August 1944 when the Germans withdrew from the Spanish frontier.Spanish neutrality during World War II was appreciated and publicly acknowledged by leading Allied statesmen. In November 1942 President Roosevelt wrote to General Franco: \"...your nation and mine are friends in the best sense of the word.\" In May 1944 Winston Churchill stated in the House of Commons: \"in the dark days of the war the attitude of the Spanish Government in not giving our enemies passage through Spain was extremelly helpful to us...I must say that I shall always consider that a service was rendered...by Spain, not only to the United Kingdom  and to the British Empire and Commonwealth, but to the cause of the United Nations.\" Similar gratitude was also expressed by the Provisional French Government. Franco interposed no obstacle to Britain's construction of a big air base extending out of Gibraltar into Spanish territorial waters, and welcomed the Anglo-American landings in North Africa. Moreover, Spain did not intern any of the 1,200 American airmen who were forced to land in the country, but gave them shelter and helped them to leave.After the war, the Spanish government tried to destroy all evidence of its cooperation with the Axis. In 2010 documents were discovered showing that on 13 May 1941, Franco ordered his provincial governors to compile a list of Jews while he negotiated an alliance with the Axis powers. Franco supplied Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, architect of the Nazis' Final Solution, with a list of 6,000 Jews in Spain.On 14 June 1940, Spanish forces in Morocco occupied Tangier (a city under the rule of the League of Nations) and did not leave until the war's end in 1945.\nAfter the war, Franco allowed many former Nazis, such as Otto Skorzeny and L\u00e9on Degrelle, and other former fascists, to flee to Spain.\n\n\n=== Treatment of Jews ===\nFranco had a controversial association with Jews during the WWII period. In 2010, documents were discovered showing that on 13 May 1941, Franco ordered his provincial governors to compile a list of Jews while he negotiated an alliance with the Axis powers. Franco supplied Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, architect of the Nazis' Final Solution, with a list of 6,000 Jews in Spain.Contrarily, according to Anti-Semitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution (2005):\n\nThroughout the war, Franco rescued many Jews....Just how many Jews were saved by Franco's government during World War II is a matter of historical controversy. Franco has been credited with saving anywhere from approximately 30,000 to 60,000 Jews; most reliable estimates suggest 45,000 is a likely figure.Spain provided visas for thousands of French Jews to transit Spain en route to Portugal to escape the Nazis. Spanish diplomats protected about 4,000 Jews living in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. At least some 20,000 to 30,000 Jews were allowed to pass through Spain in the first half of the War. Jews who were not allowed to enter Spain, however, were sent to the Miranda de Ebro concentration camp or deported to France. In January 1943, after the German embassy in Spain told the Spanish government that it had two months to remove its Jewish citizens from Western Europe, Spain severely limited visas, and only 800 Jews were allowed to enter the country. After the war, Franco exaggerated his contribution to helping to save Jews to end Spain's isolation, to improve Spain's image in the world.After the war, Franco did not recognize Israeli statehood, and Israel expressed disinterest in establishing relations, although there were some informal economic ties between the countries in the later years of the regime.\nThe regime's propaganda claimed that there was an international conspiracy of Jews, Freemasons, and Communists against Spain. Under the Francoist regime, Jews, along with other non-Catholic communities, were heavily discriminated against \u2013 in 1945, the regime enacted the \"Spanish Bill of Rights\" (Fuero de los Espa\u00f1oles), which allowed the worship of non-Catholic religions; however, worship of non-Catholic religions was only allowed in private, no signs to indicate they were places of worship were allowed, and only Catholic public ceremonies were allowed, making it a huge regression in comparison to the Republican Constitution of 1931, which granted Jews rights they had not enjoyed in Spain since their expulsion in 1492. The situation improved with the 1967 Law on Religious Freedom, but discrimination still existed and non-Catholic groups were forced to register with the regime and to provide records of their members.On 16 December 1968, the regime formally revoked the 1492 Edict of Expulsion against Spain's Jewish population.Freedom of religion would be completely established in Spain in 1978, with the new Constitution of Spain, three years after Franco's death.\n\n\n== Spain under Franco ==\n\nFranco was recognized as the Spanish head of state by Great Britain, France and Argentina in February 1939. Already proclaimed General\u00edsimo of the Nationalists and Jefe del Estado (Head of State) in October 1936, he thereafter assumed the official title of \"Su Excelencia el Jefe de Estado\" (\"His Excellency the Head of State\"). He was also referred to in state and official documents as \"Caudillo de Espa\u00f1a\" (\"the Leader of Spain\"), and sometimes called \"el Caudillo de la \u00daltima Cruzada y de la Hispanidad\" (\"the Leader of the Last Crusade and of the Hispanic heritage\") and \"el Caudillo de la Guerra de Liberaci\u00f3n contra el Comunismo y sus C\u00f3mplices\" (\"the Leader of the War of Liberation Against Communism and Its Accomplices\").\nOn paper, Franco had more power than any Spanish leader before or since. For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees. According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power. He noted that while Hitler and Stalin maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, this was not the case in Spain in the early years after the war \u2013 a situation that nominally made Franco's regime \"the most purely arbitrary in the world\".This changed in 1942, when Franco convened a parliament known as the Cortes Espa\u00f1olas. It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the Movimiento Nacional (Carlists and Alfonsists). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a de facto regent for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a Captain General (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in El Pardo Palace. In addition he began walking under a canopy, and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins and postage stamps. He also added \"by the grace of God\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of technocrats, many of whom were linked with Opus Dei, who promoted economic modernisation.\n\nAlthough Franco adopted some trappings of fascism, he, and Spain under his rule, are generally not considered to be fascist; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, he was by nature conservative and traditional. Stanley Payne notes that very few scholars consider him to be a \"core fascist\". The few consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all authoritarianism, nationalism, Catholicism, anti-Freemasonry, and anti-communism.\nWith the end of World War II, Spain suffered from the consequences of its isolation from the international economy. Spain was excluded from the Marshall Plan, unlike other neutral countries in Europe. This situation ended in part when, in the light of Cold War tensions and of Spain's strategic location, the United States of America entered into a trade and military alliance with Franco. This historic alliance commenced with the visit of US President Dwight Eisenhower to Spain in 1953, which resulted in the Pact of Madrid. Spain was then admitted to the United Nations in 1955. American military facilities in Spain built since then include Naval Station Rota, Mor\u00f3n Air Base, and Torrej\u00f3n Air Base.\n\n\n=== Political repression ===\nThe first decade of Franco's rule following the end of the Civil War in 1939 saw continued repression and the killing of an undetermined number of political opponents. Estimation is difficult and controversial, but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000.\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the political spectrum, from communist and anarchist organisations to liberal democrats and Catalan or Basque separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist Sindicato Vertical. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) went underground. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the ETA armed group was created to wage a low-intensity war against Franco.\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. Bullfighting and flamenco were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered \"Spanish\" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, flamenco, an Andalusian tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the Sardana, the national dance of Catalonia, were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nFranco also used language politics in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of Castilian Spanish and suppressed other languages such as Catalan, Galician, and Basque. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\nThe Catholic Church was upheld as the established church of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. Divorce was forbidden, along with contraceptives, and abortion.Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of Guardia Civil, a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the Policia Armada, or the grises (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed Polic\u00eda Armada (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities. The enforcement by public authorities of traditional Catholic values was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes, Vagrancy Act) enacted by Aza\u00f1a. The remaining nomads of Spain (Gitanos and Mercheros like El Lute) were especially affected. Through this law, homosexuality and prostitution were made criminal offenses in 1954.\n\n\n=== Women in Francoist Spain ===\n\nFrancoism professed a devotion to the traditional role of a woman in society, that is being a loving daughter and sister to her parents and brothers, being a faithful wife to her husband, and residing with her family. Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s women could not open a bank account without having it co-signed by her father or husband. In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n\n=== The Spanish colonies and decolonisation ===\n\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonies throughout Franco's rule. During the Algerian War (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve French Algeria. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When French Morocco became independent in 1956, he surrendered Spanish Morocco to Morocco, retaining only a few enclaves (the Plazas de soberan\u00eda). The year after, Mohammed V invaded Spanish Sahara during the Ifni War (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the Green March, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\nIn 1968, under pressure from the United Nations, Spain granted Equatorial Guinea its independence, and the following year it ceded Ifni to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and closed its border with that territory in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of autarky, cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States and the IMF managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"Spanish miracle\".\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer SEAT, truck builder Pegaso, and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n\n== Succession ==\n\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency, but the simmering tensions between the Carlists and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the Carlist Wars, he offered the throne to the Habsburg Archduke Otto von Habsburg; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a Bourbon succession entirely, since the Habsburg family which had ruled the Habsburg Spain during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the War of the Spanish Succession. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a German ruling Spain and could never forget his Austrian identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n, who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the Carlist pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona, who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal. Nevertheless, the 56-year old Count didn't stand a chance against his charming son, whose youth allowed for an appropriate grooming by francoist tutors and was not tainted by a deserved reputation as a dissolute drink-loving aristocrat that clashed with the prevailing mores of the time.However, when Juan Carlos asked Franco if he could sit in on cabinet meetings, Franco would not permit him saying that \"you would do things differently.\" Due to the spread of democracy, excluding the Eastern Bloc, in Europe since World War II, Juan Carlos could or would not have been a dictator in the way Franco had been.By 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (Presidente del Gobierno), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the Movimiento would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The assassination of prime minister Luis Carrero Blanco in the 20 December 1973 bombing by ETA eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health problems, including a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a coma and was put on life support. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2013 on the same date as the death of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange, in 1936. Historian Ricardo de la Cierva claimed that he had been told around 6 pm on 19 November that Franco had already died. Juan Carlos was proclaimed King two days later.\nFranco's body was interred at Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, a colossal memorial built by the forced labour of political prisoners to honour the casualties of both sides of the Spanish Civil War. The site was designated by the interim government, assured by Prince Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro, as the burial place for Franco. According to his family, Franco did not want to be buried in the Valley, but in the Almudena Cathedral in Madrid. Nonetheless, the family agreed to the interim government's request to bury him in the Valley, and has stood by the decision. This made Franco the only person interred in the Valley who did not die during the civil war.\nNo Western European countries sent their leaders to attend Franco's funeral due to his tenure as dictator. The following guests took part in his funeral:\n\n Gaston Thorn, President of the United Nations General Assembly\n Jean Rey, President of the European Commission\n Juan Carlos I, King of Spain\n Rainier III, Sovereign Prince of Monaco\n Lord Shepherd, Leader of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom\n Augusto Pinochet, President of Chile\n Hugo Banzer, President of Bolivia\n Jorge Rafael Videla, future President of Argentina\n Nelson Rockefeller, Vice President of the United States\n Hussein, King of JordanIt was revealed that both Pinochet and Banzer revered Franco and modelled their leadership style on the Spanish leader. Former US President Richard Nixon called Franco \"a loyal friend and ally of the United States.\"\n\n\n== Exhumation ==\nOn 11 May 2017, the Congress of Deputies approved, by 198\u20131 with 140 abstentions, a motion driven by the Socialist Workers' Party ordering the Government to exhume Franco's remains.On 24 August 2018, the Government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez approved legal amendments to the Historical Memory Law stating that only those who died during the Civil War would be buried at the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, resulting in plans to exhume Franco's remains for reburial elsewhere. Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo Poyato stated that having Franco buried at the monument \"shows a lack of respect ... for the victims buried there\". The government gave Franco's family a 15-day deadline to decide Franco's final resting place, or else a \"dignified place\" will be chosen by the government.On 13 September 2018, the Congress of Deputies voted 176\u20132, with 165 abstentions, to approve the government's plan to remove Franco's body from the monument.Franco's family opposed the exhumation, and attempted to prevent it by making appeals to the Ombudsman's Office. The family expressed its wish that Franco's remains be reinterred with full military honors at the Almudena Cathedral in the centre of Madrid, the burial place he had requested before his death. The demand was rejected by the Spanish Government, which issued another 15-day deadline to choose another site. Because the family refused to choose another location, the Spanish Government ultimately chose to rebury Franco at the Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo, where his wife Carmen Polo and a number of Francoist officials, most notably prime ministers Luis Carrero Blanco and Carlos Arias Navarro, are buried. His body was to be exhumed from the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos on 10 June 2019, but the Supreme Court of Spain ruled that the exhumation would be delayed until the family had exhausted all possible appeals. On 24 September 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the exhumation could proceed, and the S\u00e1nchez government announced that it would move Franco's remains to the Mingorrubio cemetery as soon as possible. On 24 October 2019 his remains were moved to his wife's mausoleum which is located in the Mingorrubio Cemetery, and buried in a private ceremony. Though barred by the Spanish government from being draped in the Spanish flag, Francisco Franco's grandson, also named Francisco Franco, draped his coffin in the nationalist flag.According to a poll by the Spanish newspaper, El Mundo, 43% of Spanish people approved of the exhumation while 32.5% opposed it. The exhumation also seems to have been an opinion divided by party line with the Socialist party strongly in favor of its removal as well as the removal of his statue there. There seems to be no consensus on whether the statue should simply be moved or completely destroyed.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. The longevity of Franco's rule, his suppression of opposition, and the effective propaganda sustained through the years have made a detached evaluation difficult. For almost 40 years, Spaniards, and particularly children at school, were told that Divine Providence had sent Franco to save Spain from chaos, atheism, and poverty. Historian Stanley Payne described Franco as being the most significant figure to dominate Spain since Philip II, while Michael Seidman argued that Franco was the most successful counterrevolutionary leader of the 20th century.A highly controversial figure within Spain, Franco is seen as a divisive leader. Supporters credit him for keeping Spain neutral and uninvaded in World War II. They emphasize his strong anti-communist and nationalist views, economic policies, and opposition to socialism as major factors in Spain's post-war economic success and later international integration. Abroad he had support from Winston Churchill, Charles De Gaulle, Konrad Adenauer and many American Catholics, but was strongly opposed by the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.Conversely, critics on the left have denounced him as a tyrant responsible for thousands of deaths in years-long political repression, and have called him complicit in atrocities committed by Axis forces during World War II due to his support of Axis governments.\nWhen he died in 1975, the major parties of the left and the right agreed to follow the \"Pact of Forgetting\". To secure the transition to democracy, they agreed not to have investigations or prosecutions dealing with the civil war or Franco. The agreement effectively lapsed after 2000, the year the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory was founded and the public debate started. In 2006, a poll indicated that almost two-thirds of Spaniards favored a \"fresh investigation into the war\".The Oxford Living Dictionary uses Franco's regime as an example of fascism. However, most historians agree that although Franco and Spain under his rule adopted some trappings of fascism they are generally not considered to be fascist, at most describing the early totalitarian phase of his rule as a \"fascistized dictatorship\", or \"semi-fascist regime\".Franco served as a role model for several anti-communist dictators in South America. Augusto Pinochet is known to have admired Franco. Similarly, as recently as 2006, Franco supporters in Spain have honored Pinochet.In 2006, the BBC reported that Maciej Giertych, an MEP of the clerical-nationalist League of Polish Families, had expressed admiration for Franco, stating that the Spanish leader \"guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe\".\n\nSpaniards who suffered under Franco's rule have sought to remove memorials of his regime. Most government buildings and streets that were named after Franco during his rule have been reverted to their original names. Owing to Franco's human-rights record, the Spanish government in 2007 banned all official public references to the Franco regime and began the removal of all statues, street names and memorials associated with the regime, with the last statue reportedly being removed in 2008 in the city of Santander. Churches that retain plaques commemorating Franco and the victims of his Republican opponents may lose state aid. Since 1978, the national anthem of Spain, the Marcha Real, does not include lyrics introduced by Franco. Attempts to give the national anthem new lyrics have failed due to lack of consensus.\nIn March 2006, the Permanent Commission of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe unanimously adopted a resolution \"firmly\" condemning the \"multiple and serious violations\" of human rights committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975. The resolution was at the initiative of Leo Brincat and of the historian Luis Mar\u00eda de Puig, and was the first international official condemnation of the repression enacted by Franco's regime. The resolution also urged that historians (professional and amateur) be given access to the various archives of the Francoist regime, including those of the private Francisco Franco National Foundation (FNFF) which, along with other Francoist archives, remain inaccessible to the public as of 2006. The FNFF received various archives from the El Pardo Palace, and is alleged to have sold some of them to private individuals. Furthermore, the resolution urged the Spanish authorities to set up an underground exhibit in the Valle de los Caidos monument to explain the \"terrible\" conditions in which it was built. Finally, it proposed the construction of monuments to commemorate Franco's victims in Madrid and other important cities.In Spain, a commission to \"repair the dignity\" and \"restore the memory\" of the \"victims of Francoism\" (Comisi\u00f3n para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las v\u00edctimas del franquismo) was approved in 2004, and is directed by the social-democratic deputy Prime Minister Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega.\n\nRecently the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARHM) initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, which has been supported since the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's (PSOE) victory during the 2004 elections by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's government. A Ley de la memoria hist\u00f3rica de Espa\u00f1a (Law on the Historical Memory of Spain) was approved on 28 July 2006, by the Council of Ministers, but it took until 31 October 2007, for the Congress of Deputies to approve an amended version as \"The Bill to recognise and extend rights and to establish measures in favour of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Civil War and the Dictatorship\" (in common parlance still known as Law of Historical Memory). The Senate approved the bill on 10 December 2007.Official endeavors to preserve the historical memory of the Franco regime include exhibitions like the one the Museu d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya (Museum of Catalan History) organised around the prison experience.The accumulated wealth of Franco's family (including much real estate inherited from Franco, such as the Pazo de Meir\u00e1s, the Canto del Pico in Torrelodones and the Casa Cornide in A Coru\u00f1a), and its provenance, have also become matters of public discussion. Estimates of the family's wealth have ranged from 350 million to 600 million euros. While Franco was dying, the Francoist Cortes voted a large public pension for his wife Carmen Polo, which the later democratic governments kept paying. At the time of her death in 1988, Carmen Polo was receiving as a pension more than 12.5 million pesetas (four million more than the salary of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, then head of the government).\n\n\n== In popular media ==\n\n\n=== Cinema and television ===\n\n\n=== Music ===\nFrench singer-songwriter and anarchist L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9 wrote \"Franco la muerte\", a song he recorded for his 1964 album Ferr\u00e9 64. In this highly confrontational song, he directly shouts at the dictator and lavishes him with contempt. Ferr\u00e9 refused to sing in Spain until Franco was dead.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nFranco is a character in CJ Sansom's book Winter in Madrid\n...Y al tercer a\u00f1o resucit\u00f3 (...And On the Third Year He Rose Again) (1980) describes what would happen if Franco rose from the dead.\nFranco is featured in the novel Triage (1998) by Scott Anderson.\nFranco is the centrepiece of the satirical work El general Franquisimo o La muerte civil de un militar moribundo by Andalusian political cartoonist and journalist Andr\u00e9s V\u00e1zquez de Sola.\nFranco features in several novels by Caroline Angus Baker, including Vengeance in the Valencian Water, visiting the aftermath of the 1957 Valencia floods, and Death in the Valencian Dust, about the final executions handed down before his death in 1975.\nDr Halliday Sutherland was invited to visit Spain for 12 weeks in 1946 as a guest of the Spanish government. He agreed on condition that he would be free to go where he liked and to talk to anyone whom he chose to meet. He wrote about his experiences in \"Spanish Journey\" (1948).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLanguage politics in Francoist Spain\nList of dictators in modern times\nSymbols of Francoism\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSaz Campos, Ismael (2004).

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "Antigua Guatemala (Spanish pronunciation: [an\u02c8ti\u0263wa \u0263wate\u02c8mala]), commonly referred to as just Antigua or la Antigua, is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala known for its preserved Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture as well as a number of ruins of colonial churches. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nAntigua Guatemala serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It also serves as the departmental capital of Sacatep\u00e9quez Department.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe city had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the 1990s. At the time of the 2007 census, the city had 34,685 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAntigua Guatemala means \"Old Guatemala\" and was the third capital of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kakchikel-Maya city, now called Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524\u2014the day of Saint James\u2014and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemalan (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally, St. James became the patron saint of the city.After several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, which is a neighborhood in the municipality of Ciudad Vieja. This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541, by a devastating lahar from the Volc\u00e1n de Agua. As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time five miles away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543, the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala, a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas.\nSantiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, besides modern state of Chiapas in Mexico.  After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n de Agua a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.The city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square.  Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza.  Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general. The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls.  The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called \"Valley of Guatemala\" and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.Due to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565. In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico and the new organization was called Audiencia of Guatemala.The Franciscan friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected.  This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one. The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala: Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are. Notable students included Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando, Thomas Merlo, and Alonso de Paz.\n\nThe first building of a cathedral was begun in 1545 with the debris brought from the destroyed settlement in the valley of Almolonga; however, its construction was hampered by frequent earthquakes throughout the years.  The city was the final resting place of the great Spanish chronicler Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, and his remains were interred in one of the churches that was eventually ruined by earthquakes.\nThe construction of the royal houses for the residence of the Captain General and the members of the Real Audiencia started in 1558; the complex also included the Royal Treasury, jail, Army quarters, the Hall of Arms, and the housing of Audiencia members.In the sixteenth century, there were several important earthquakes on the following dates: \n\nMarch 21, 1530\nSeptember 11, 1541\n1565 (exact date unknown)\n1575 (exact date unknown)\nNovember 30, 1577\nDecember 23, 1585In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain gave it the title of \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\" (\"Very Noble and Very Loyal\").\n\n\n=== 17th-century events ===\n\nThe Jesuits founded the school of \"San Lucas of the Society of Jesus\" in 1608, which became famous and was unrivaled in terms of literature and grammar lessons;  it was attended by the elite nobles of the city society, such as Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the chronicler Francisco V\u00e1zquez, and Pedro Betancourt.  On 18 July 1626, the Jesuit temple was inaugurated; along with the rest of the city, it suffered and was damaged by continuous earthquakes that struck the city between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.The monks of San Juan de Dios founded their hospital and monastery in 1636 and thereafter were in charge of the hospitals in the Kingdom of Guatemala.  Their hospitals were: \n\nSan Alejo: for indigenous people\nSan Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel\nSantiago: for Spanish and mulattos\nSan L\u00e1zaro\nSan Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the Dominicans who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.The temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri.  Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the \"San Francisco de Borja\" where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, S.J., eventually would study and serve as principal.\nIn the seventeenth century there were two types of nuns: discalced and urban.\n\n\n==== Saint Hermano Pedro ====\nPedro de San Jos\u00e9 Betancourt came to Guatemalan land in 1650 from his native Tenerife. Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed.  After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor. Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz's brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas.  He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies.  Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.\n\n\n==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====\n\nFrancisco Marroqu\u00edn, first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for Guatemala, but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroqu\u00edn left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the \"Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino school\"- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as M\u00e9xico City in the New Spain. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, \"Marroqu\u00edn's testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroqu\u00edn never talks about a University, much less establishing one...\" On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the University that \"was being asked of the crown\".The Jesuits opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other regular clergy orders -Mercedarians, Franciscans and Order of Preachers- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues. In August 1655, the Society of Jesus had bought the whole lot from the D\u00edaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees. In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala. The school was the city's most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.After several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, king Carlos II expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala to establish its university or \"General Study.\" After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor Jos\u00e9 de Ba\u00f1os y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the M\u00e9xico University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.\nThe first classes given in the university were:\n\nCanonic law\nMedicine\nScholastic theology\nMoral theology\nLanguagesThe Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the Papal Bull of Pope Innocent XI, issued and dated 18 June 1687.\n\n\n=== 18th-century events ===\n\n\n==== San Miguel Earthquake ====\n\nThe strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717.  At that time, the power of the Catholic Church over the Spanish Empire's citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment.  In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.On August 27 there was a strong eruption of Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, which lasted until August 30;  the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego.  On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel.  Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00 p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock.  The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.The San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed.  There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured. These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity.  City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable.  The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there was additional work done by Porres until 1736.\n\n\n==== San Casimiro earthquake ====\nOn March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more.  The church roof of the Society of Jesus complex fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild.  Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed. In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system.  A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.\n\n\n==== Santa Marta earthquake ====\n\nOn 12 June 1773 Captain General Mart\u00edn de Mayorga was inaugurated, and alongside Cort\u00e9s y Larr\u00e1z and the regular clergy vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.In 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).The Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus.  Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the \"Casa de Ejercicios\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \"Virgin valley\" was authorized.  This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala.  However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.\n\n\n=== 19th-century events ===\n\n\n==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====\n\nAfter the independence of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n and the establishment of a secular government. The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms.As of 1850, Antigua had an estimated population of 9,000. and by 1865, the building was functioning as a vapor activated thread mill, but it was not profitable due to a lack of expert technicians and raw material; and by 1872, the Jesuits were once again expelled from Guatemala by the liberal regime of Justo Rufino Barrios.In 1884 City Hall made an announcement that it intended to transform the old Society of Jesus buildings into a market, in spite of the strong opposition from the neighbors that already had small shops on the plaza.  It was not until 1912 that a market was placed in the complex.\n\n\n=== 20th-century events ===\n\nIn April 1920, during the very last days of Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime, prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited Antigua Guatemala and wrote about his impressions of the city in his book Between two continents. His book is an objective description of the terrible conditions the road and the ruins used to be in: \"For some little way outside Guatemala City it was a fairly decent car ride, but then the roads began developing sand drifts, and later, rockfalls of tumbled stone as two years earlier, the country had been devastated by a powerful earthquake and government corruption made the recovery impossible\".  \"The hills grew steeper and steeper, the jolting more pronounced and the stones even sharper; besides, on top of the road was a two-foot layer of dust which hid the pitfalls but did not detract from their effect\".  \"Along the way, they passed long lines of Indians on their way to Guatemala City, carrying their heavy burdens with apparent ease; men, women and children carried something in the way of a load, and they all carried it quickly. With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons\".After passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died.  After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua.  The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns. Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920, and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions.  In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.But there were other monuments in decent shape: \n\nThe Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing.  The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.\nThe old Capuchin monastery with its many underground passages from the monks' cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.\n\n\n== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==\n\nCentral Park \u2013 Parque Central \u2013 is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (Semana Santa) and Easter (Pascua). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local parishes sponsors a Procession through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions' paths.Due to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHistorically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala. Tourism is the main driver of the economy.  Antigua is also a coffee-producing region of Anacaf\u00e9.\n\n\n== Language schools ==\nAntigua is known as a destination for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for studying the Spanish language by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAntigua GFC football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo, which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed Los panzas verdes (\"Green bellies\") and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThere are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/Chapin breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade tortillas. Throughout Antigua you can find many cuisines from around the world: Mediterranean, Italian, Asian, American, and British pies and French pastries.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAntigua is served by two main hospitals, Hospital Nacional Pedro de Bethancourt and a Guatemalan Institute of Social Security hospital. Emergency medical services are provided by Bomberos Municipales (Guatemala) and Bomberos Voluntarios (Guatemala), who have both previously worked with LFR International to improve prehospital care.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThree large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua. The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the Volc\u00e1n de Agua or \"Volcano of Water\", some 3,766 metres (12,356 ft) high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunap\u00fa (and they still do). However, it became known as Volc\u00e1n de Agua after a lahar from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village San Miguel Escobar.\nTo the west of the city are a pair of peaks, Acatenango, which last erupted in 1972, some 3,976 metres (13,045 ft) high, and the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego or \"Volcano of Fire\", some 3,763 metres (12,346 ft) high. \"Fuego\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities.  It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala.  Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Lanqu\u00edn (Semuc Champey), or Tikal, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City. Antigua is also known for its chocolate makers.\n\n\n=== Spanish Colony monuments ===\n\nBefore it was declared a National Monument by president Jorge Ubico on March 30, 1944, the city ruins were practically abandoned. The following galleries show images of the destruction of the structures due to earthquakes and abandonment. There were other churches, such as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen and the Society of Jesus, that endured the 1773 earthquake relatively well, but they were abandoned and the earthquakes from 1917\u201318 and 1976 destroyed them. In the particular case of de San Francisco El Grande church, it was in good structural condition after the 1773 and 1917 earthquakes, and it was rebuilt in 1967 when the Franciscans returned to Guatemala. This eventually protected the structure from significant damage in the 1976 earthquake. Finally, La Merced church was practically new in 1773, and it has withstood time and earthquakes since; the church was not abandoned in 1776, but it was indeed abandoned in 1829 when the Mercedarians were expelled from Central America by general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, along with the rest of regular clergy and the conservative party members and Aycinena family.\n\n\n=== Holy Week ===\n\nThe most traditional processions are:\n\n\n== In films ==\n\n\n=== The New Adventures of Tarzan (1935) ===\n\nIn 1935, the film The New Adventures of Tarzan, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964).

It's known by the nickname of \"El sal\u00f3n de la ciudad\" (in English: the hall of the city), since many public parties are held there. 1 It's also called Plaza de las Catedrales (in English: Plaza of the Cathedrals), because here are the two cathedrals of Zaragoza: the Seo and the Pilar.In this plaza are, in addition to the Basilica del Pilar, buildings such as the City Hall, the Fountain of Hispanicity, the Cathedral of El Salvador (La Seo), some court buildings and the Monument to Goya.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population.

Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city.

        "wiki": "Antigua Guatemala (Spanish pronunciation: [an\u02c8ti\u0263wa \u0263wate\u02c8mala]), commonly referred to as just Antigua or la Antigua, is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala known for its preserved Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture as well as a number of ruins of colonial churches. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nAntigua Guatemala serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It also serves as the departmental capital of Sacatep\u00e9quez Department.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe city had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the 1990s. At the time of the 2007 census, the city had 34,685 inhabitants.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAntigua Guatemala means \"Old Guatemala\" and was the third capital of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kakchikel-Maya city, now called Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524\u2014the day of Saint James\u2014and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemalan (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally, St. James became the patron saint of the city.After several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, which is a neighborhood in the municipality of Ciudad Vieja. This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541, by a devastating lahar from the Volc\u00e1n de Agua. As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time five miles away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543, the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala, a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas.\nSantiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, besides modern state of Chiapas in Mexico.  After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n de Agua a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.The city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square.  Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza.  Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general. The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls.  The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called \"Valley of Guatemala\" and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.Due to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565. In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico and the new organization was called Audiencia of Guatemala.The Franciscan friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected.  This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one. The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala: Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are. Notable students included Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando, Thomas Merlo, and Alonso de Paz.\n\nThe first building of a cathedral was begun in 1545 with the debris brought from the destroyed settlement in the valley of Almolonga; however, its construction was hampered by frequent earthquakes throughout the years.  The city was the final resting place of the great Spanish chronicler Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, and his remains were interred in one of the churches that was eventually ruined by earthquakes.\nThe construction of the royal houses for the residence of the Captain General and the members of the Real Audiencia started in 1558; the complex also included the Royal Treasury, jail, Army quarters, the Hall of Arms, and the housing of Audiencia members.In the sixteenth century, there were several important earthquakes on the following dates: \n\nMarch 21, 1530\nSeptember 11, 1541\n1565 (exact date unknown)\n1575 (exact date unknown)\nNovember 30, 1577\nDecember 23, 1585In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain gave it the title of \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\" (\"Very Noble and Very Loyal\").\n\n\n=== 17th-century events ===\n\nThe Jesuits founded the school of \"San Lucas of the Society of Jesus\" in 1608, which became famous and was unrivaled in terms of literature and grammar lessons;  it was attended by the elite nobles of the city society, such as Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the chronicler Francisco V\u00e1zquez, and Pedro Betancourt.  On 18 July 1626, the Jesuit temple was inaugurated; along with the rest of the city, it suffered and was damaged by continuous earthquakes that struck the city between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.The monks of San Juan de Dios founded their hospital and monastery in 1636 and thereafter were in charge of the hospitals in the Kingdom of Guatemala.  Their hospitals were: \n\nSan Alejo: for indigenous people\nSan Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel\nSantiago: for Spanish and mulattos\nSan L\u00e1zaro\nSan Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the Dominicans who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.The temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri.  Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the \"San Francisco de Borja\" where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, S.J., eventually would study and serve as principal.\nIn the seventeenth century there were two types of nuns: discalced and urban.\n\n\n==== Saint Hermano Pedro ====\nPedro de San Jos\u00e9 Betancourt came to Guatemalan land in 1650 from his native Tenerife. Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed.  After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor. Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz's brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas.  He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies.  Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.\n\n\n==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====\n\nFrancisco Marroqu\u00edn, first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for Guatemala, but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroqu\u00edn left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the \"Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino school\"- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as M\u00e9xico City in the New Spain. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, \"Marroqu\u00edn's testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroqu\u00edn never talks about a University, much less establishing one...\" On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the University that \"was being asked of the crown\".The Jesuits opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other regular clergy orders -Mercedarians, Franciscans and Order of Preachers- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues. In August 1655, the Society of Jesus had bought the whole lot from the D\u00edaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees. In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala. The school was the city's most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.After several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, king Carlos II expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala to establish its university or \"General Study.\" After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor Jos\u00e9 de Ba\u00f1os y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the M\u00e9xico University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.\nThe first classes given in the university were:\n\nCanonic law\nMedicine\nScholastic theology\nMoral theology\nLanguagesThe Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the Papal Bull of Pope Innocent XI, issued and dated 18 June 1687.\n\n\n=== 18th-century events ===\n\n\n==== San Miguel Earthquake ====\n\nThe strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717.  At that time, the power of the Catholic Church over the Spanish Empire's citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment.  In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.On August 27 there was a strong eruption of Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, which lasted until August 30;  the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego.  On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel.  Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00 p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock.  The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.The San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed.  There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured. These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity.  City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable.  The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there was additional work done by Porres until 1736.\n\n\n==== San Casimiro earthquake ====\nOn March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more.  The church roof of the Society of Jesus complex fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild.  Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed. In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system.  A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.\n\n\n==== Santa Marta earthquake ====\n\nOn 12 June 1773 Captain General Mart\u00edn de Mayorga was inaugurated, and alongside Cort\u00e9s y Larr\u00e1z and the regular clergy vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.In 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).The Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus.  Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the \"Casa de Ejercicios\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \"Virgin valley\" was authorized.  This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala.  However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.\n\n\n=== 19th-century events ===\n\n\n==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====\n\nAfter the independence of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n and the establishment of a secular government. The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms.As of 1850, Antigua had an estimated population of 9,000. and by 1865, the building was functioning as a vapor activated thread mill, but it was not profitable due to a lack of expert technicians and raw material; and by 1872, the Jesuits were once again expelled from Guatemala by the liberal regime of Justo Rufino Barrios.In 1884 City Hall made an announcement that it intended to transform the old Society of Jesus buildings into a market, in spite of the strong opposition from the neighbors that already had small shops on the plaza.  It was not until 1912 that a market was placed in the complex.\n\n\n=== 20th-century events ===\n\nIn April 1920, during the very last days of Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime, prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited Antigua Guatemala and wrote about his impressions of the city in his book Between two continents. His book is an objective description of the terrible conditions the road and the ruins used to be in: \"For some little way outside Guatemala City it was a fairly decent car ride, but then the roads began developing sand drifts, and later, rockfalls of tumbled stone as two years earlier, the country had been devastated by a powerful earthquake and government corruption made the recovery impossible\".  \"The hills grew steeper and steeper, the jolting more pronounced and the stones even sharper; besides, on top of the road was a two-foot layer of dust which hid the pitfalls but did not detract from their effect\".  \"Along the way, they passed long lines of Indians on their way to Guatemala City, carrying their heavy burdens with apparent ease; men, women and children carried something in the way of a load, and they all carried it quickly. With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons\".After passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died.  After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua.  The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns. Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920, and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions.  In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.But there were other monuments in decent shape: \n\nThe Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing.  The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.\nThe old Capuchin monastery with its many underground passages from the monks' cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.\n\n\n== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==\n\nCentral Park \u2013 Parque Central \u2013 is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (Semana Santa) and Easter (Pascua). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local parishes sponsors a Procession through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions' paths.Due to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHistorically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala. Tourism is the main driver of the economy.  Antigua is also a coffee-producing region of Anacaf\u00e9.\n\n\n== Language schools ==\nAntigua is known as a destination for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for studying the Spanish language by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nAntigua GFC football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo, which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed Los panzas verdes (\"Green bellies\") and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThere are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/Chapin breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade tortillas. Throughout Antigua you can find many cuisines from around the world: Mediterranean, Italian, Asian, American, and British pies and French pastries.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAntigua is served by two main hospitals, Hospital Nacional Pedro de Bethancourt and a Guatemalan Institute of Social Security hospital. Emergency medical services are provided by Bomberos Municipales (Guatemala) and Bomberos Voluntarios (Guatemala), who have both previously worked with LFR International to improve prehospital care.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThree large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua. The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the Volc\u00e1n de Agua or \"Volcano of Water\", some 3,766 metres (12,356 ft) high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunap\u00fa (and they still do). However, it became known as Volc\u00e1n de Agua after a lahar from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village San Miguel Escobar.\nTo the west of the city are a pair of peaks, Acatenango, which last erupted in 1972, some 3,976 metres (13,045 ft) high, and the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego or \"Volcano of Fire\", some 3,763 metres (12,346 ft) high. \"Fuego\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities.  It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala.  Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Lanqu\u00edn (Semuc Champey), or Tikal, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City. Antigua is also known for its chocolate makers.\n\n\n=== Spanish Colony monuments ===\n\nBefore it was declared a National Monument by president Jorge Ubico on March 30, 1944, the city ruins were practically abandoned. The following galleries show images of the destruction of the structures due to earthquakes and abandonment. There were other churches, such as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen and the Society of Jesus, that endured the 1773 earthquake relatively well, but they were abandoned and the earthquakes from 1917\u201318 and 1976 destroyed them. In the particular case of de San Francisco El Grande church, it was in good structural condition after the 1773 and 1917 earthquakes, and it was rebuilt in 1967 when the Franciscans returned to Guatemala. This eventually protected the structure from significant damage in the 1976 earthquake. Finally, La Merced church was practically new in 1773, and it has withstood time and earthquakes since; the church was not abandoned in 1776, but it was indeed abandoned in 1829 when the Mercedarians were expelled from Central America by general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, along with the rest of regular clergy and the conservative party members and Aycinena family.\n\n\n=== Holy Week ===\n\nThe most traditional processions are:\n\n\n== In films ==\n\n\n=== The New Adventures of Tarzan (1935) ===\n\nIn 1935, the film The New Adventures of Tarzan, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico.

        "wiki": "Agustina Zaragoza y las Hero\u00ednas or the Monument to Agustina de Arag\u00f3n is an instance of public art in Zaragoza, Spain. Designed by Mariano Benlliure, it consists of a bronze statue of Agustina de Arag\u00f3n topping off a stone pedestal that displays two other sculptural groups and a number of reliefs. The latter subsidiarily pay homage to another six heroines of the Zaragozan theatre of the Peninsular War.\n\n\n== History and description ==\n\nPredated by earlier initiatives to erect a monument to Agustina de Arag\u00f3n tracing back in time at least to 1901, the committee that managed the project awarded the design to Mariano Benlliure in 1907.Cast in bronze at Cescati's foundry in Barcelona, the dashing figure of Agustina de Arag\u00f3n topping off the monument\u2014reportedly inspired in real-life Lucrecia Arana\u2014 is depicted wearing an artillery open front jacket with an epaulette and a shoulder pad, while stepping on a cannon.The front side of the white stone pedestal displays the bronze baturro (Aragonese peasant type) in attitude of crowning the name of \"agustina zaragoza\" in bronze letters on the pedestal with a laurel wreath, while carrying a guitar on his back. The back side of the pedestal features a bronze sculptural group with a Spanish lion (Zaragoza) pawing at an eagle (an allegory of the First French Empire), and an inscription reading \"2 de julio de 1808\" (\"2 July 1808\").Both the lion and eagle and the baturro were cast too at Cescati's foundry in Barcelona. The bronze was provided by the Ministry of War.The front side also presents a relief illustrating the feat of Agustina de Arag\u00f3n using the cannon. Meanwhile, the flanks of the pedestal display bronze reliefs paying homage to the heroines of Zaragoza.The monument was unveiled on 29 October 1908 at its location in the plaza del Portillo, during a ceremony attended by Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie; Antonio Maura (Prime Minister) and Florencio Jardiel (Dean of the Cathedral of Zaragoza) intervened as speakers.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\nBibliographyFiguera, Luis de la (December 1908). \"Centenario de los sitios de Zaragoza\".

Alexander \"Xander\" S. Del Tierro (Coco Martin) He comes from a prominent family with a strong military background. He has a domineering grandfather who is one of the country's feared generals, a manipulative mother solely devoted to pleasing her father, her husband but not her own son, and a father who is a respected military officer and the only one who truly understands him. He has consistently refused to join the military academy, but one major mistake made him decide otherwise. He graduates with honors from the academy; despite this achievement, Alexander feels empty. His duty took him to the mountains and it is there that he began to fill the void in his heart where he finds Javier, his twin brother. He falls in love with a rebel, Kaye who was Javier's former girlfriend, their relationship got easier as she decides to take amnesty and turn her back from her principle.\nIn Season 2, Alexander decides to be based in Manila to become closer to his family, particularly his brother. Upon the decision of the Chief of Staff, he spearheaded the investigation of carnapping incidents and suspects that Javier has been involved, even though he thought right, he failed to prove it from the evidences he has gathered. This leads Javier thinking that his family can revolve around him instead. Alexander experiences Lover's Quarrel with Krista and apologises many times, he soon tries to fix things by asking her to marry him for which Kaye refuses. As his auntie is freed from prison, he sees his affection for his brother and asks her if she could treat him like a son like his brother. Finally after months and trials of proposing to Kaye she reconciles and agrees to marry him. Alexander and his family visits Kaye's house to meet and get to know each other. Meanwhile, he finally confronts his brother of all his wrongdoings, his jealousy and immaturity after he saw his auntie (birth mother) Lora crying after she had a conversation with Javier. As Javier runs away from the police, he and Gabrielle were assigned to work with the police to help capture his brother. Days after he is informed that Javier is roaming around a street near their house. He runs for Javier and ends up getting hit by his brother. He comes back being a whole different person after the attack. In Minsan May Impostor  it is revealed that Javier is impersonating him and the real Alexander is hidden in an abandoned warehouse far from Manila in the forest. Before his twin leaves, Javier took an Iron Mask and wore it on his brother (a parody of The Man in the Iron Mask). Javier visits him again and gives him food, Alexander asks him to set him free but refuses to and tightens the mask and rope he is wearing. Meanwhile, he manages to untie the ropes until Javier comes in and pretends that he hasn't find a way to escape. He later takes the rope off and kick Javier and escapes but is unfortunately hit by Alondra and loses consciousness. Alondra and Javier immediately pulls him back and ties him up and drives away before he wakes up. He later hears Gabrielle and sees her in pain and finds that her best friend has been stabbed. He crawls to her and sees Gabrielle passing away in front of him and cries for help. At night he finds a person dragging Gabrielle's body away, suspecting that it was Javier who really was Mimi but refused to talk. Finally, Alexander finds a way to escape and breaks the padlocks and mask but is still locked inside. Javier visits him and fortunately he wins this fight and retains his name and uniform back and yearns revenge for Gabrielle's death suspecting that it is Javier's fault. He ties Javier up while he is still unconscious and in a reversal of events, he locks Javier up in the cage. He comes back to the military camp and decides not to say anything about Javier's case and that he saw Gabrielle dying in front of him. He runs for Krista and begs her not to leave; he tells her about Javier capturing him after trying so hard not to tell anyone else as it would be dangerous and would be harder to find who killed Gabrielle. He later suspects that his mother Alondra is working with Javier and can be a possible suspect concerning Gabrielle's murder. Alondra's acquaintance with Javier is later proven when he sees his mother and congratulates him for portraying Alexander so well. After finding Gabrielle's body, he checks on Javier and finds that he has escaped but someone has helped him suspecting that it is Alondra, being the only one who has kept connection with him. In Gabrielle's funeral he shares his experiences with her being his best friend and being the one by his side in laughter and sorrow, in sadness and happiness she never left his side and cares more for others and their happiness instead of hers. Alexander shares that Gabrielle is one of the person that gives all her love. That she might not be perfect as a person but is at being a friend and finishes off saying that he loves her and is ready to sacrifice himself for her. With his grandfather being furious, he speaks up and tells what he and Krista has heard concerning Diego, Ibon and Tiago's plans, being the three responsible for the attack causing Remedios' death and is still planning to kill Javier. He also informs that it wasn't him that Gabrielle was following before she died but was Javier and that he impersonated him while he was unconscious and locked up in a cage. Alexander tells them that it was Javier who broke up with Krista and courted Gabrielle and kissed her but is sure that he wasn't part of Gabrielle's death as he is in love with her. He also shares that they've kept Javier in the cage but he has escaped and says that he has only one suspicion on who helped Javier and that is Alondra. After finding out that Mimi and Tomas are related, he brought into conclusion of the possibility that Alondra might've taken him from Lora and that Lora is his real mother, he takes a DNA sample and is meanwhile proven that Lora is in fact his mother.

        "wiki": "Monasterio de Piedra (Stone Monastery) is a monastery, hotel and park complex in the Iberian System mountain ranges, near Nu\u00e9valos, province of Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. The monastery was founded in 1194 by Alfonso II of Aragon, with thirteen Cistercian monks from Poblet Monastery, in an old castle next to the Piedra River, and was dedicated to St. Mary the White (Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca). On February 16, 1983, the entire complex was declared a national monument.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Monasterio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Piedra (Monastery of our Lady of Stone) is located besides the Piedra (Stone) River. It is undoubtedly one of the most visited places in Aragon because of the many gardens and waterfalls created by the river located in the Piedra (Stone) Canyon. This attraction has become a place of rest and recreation for tourists.\nThe Monasterio de Piedra is in one of the most barren areas of Spain. Its origins date back to 1194, when Alfonso II of Aragon, and his wife Do\u00f1a Sancha donated an old Moorish castle to the monks of Poblet to build a monastery and to establish the Christian faith in the area.\nThe Monasterio de Piedra is in a mountainous region, at around 736 m above sea level in the Iberian System. The traditional access road to the monastery follows the Piedra River, starting from the Nuevalos village. Along the old path are the masonry ruins of a watermill or wheel. This beautiful spot is often used by the Cistercians as inspiration for their work and prayer. The Monasterio de Piedra was founded by Alfonso II in 1194 with monks from Poblet. The work started in 1195 and was completed in 1219. \nThe monastery lies in the confluence of the Ortiz and Piedra Rivers, in a land of thermal springs, such as Alhama and Jaraba. Followers of Islam sought to establish their cities on the rivers banks because their economy was based on agriculture, which was performed through laboring irrigated lands. This is why they chose to live on low lands and did not effectively occupy the higher areas of the Pyrenees, where they merely controlled the traffic of people and goods through fortified steps at the entrance of the valleys. This is also the reason why the noble and Christian clergy, who would be the most likely to suffer because of the arrival of Islam, had to settle on the northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula, where they began to set up churches and monasteries that would sustain those early Christian communities.\nMuslims occupied the existing cities from the Roman Empire and Visigothic civilization, restoring them to a new splendor. This was the case of Huesca, Tarazona, Calahorra and, of course, Zaragoza. In other cases, they founded new cities, such as Tudela, Calatayud, Daroca and Barbastro. This is the case of the Calatayud region, which currently belongs Nuevalos and the Monasterio de Piedra. The area had a large Muslim population which successfully resisted the Christian reconquest several times, as well as attempts of cultural assimilation. The monasteries served, among other things, as centers of evangelization and colonization.\nThe monastery was constructed for defensive strength, with a web of minor fortresses, in an area heavily populated by Muslims. Since the Muslim era, there were abundant irrigation systems, canals, ditches and castles. In 1201, Pope Innocent III issued a papal bull for D. Arnold, successor to the first abbot, confirming possession of property owned by the monastery on its own terms. In 1212 Pope Innocent III issued a papal bull confirming all former possessions. During the reign of Pedro IV the differences between monks and residents in 1335 caused the king to receive the Stone Monastery with their vassals under his tutelage. Subsequently, the pontiffs were granted protection. The monks made several altercations, among which were the passage of merchant caravans of mules, the exploitation of the salt in the municipality of Nuevalos, water use in the villages of the region, dominion over the villages, tithe, etc.\nExcerpts from the Archivo Historico Nacional in Spain in the Aragonese language correspond to a sentence of the second half of the 13th century (between 1260 and 1265). We can see among other things: the origin of the term \"pie\u00e7a\", (piece, part), which currently holds in Llumes village to designate the farms, but is lost in the rest of Aragon; the references to localities are under its current names except for Calatayud which appears as \"Calataiub\". The village now called Llumes is named \"Flumes\" from Flumen, or \"river\" in Latin. The municipalities correspond with the current ones, the limit between Monterde and Llumes is still the road from Cubel to the Monastery, which is the current limit of the Parish of San Miguel.\nOne had to cross the medieval keep to gain entrance through the walls  The church opened into the cloister, noted for its great arches, and the various premises of the monastery. The chapter house (from the early 12th century) was the vital center of monastic life; the monks resided in the main building built in the 17th century. The Romanesque columns of the former abbot's residence support the current Neoclassical one, constructed in the 18th century. In front of the keep are several ancient stones lambing enclosures transformed into hotel rooms, with their corrals landscaped.\nThe monastery was closed down in 1835 during Isabella II of Spain's rule due to the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. The Desamortizaci\u00f3n, or secularization, of the place brought monastic life to an end and the main church was destroyed. The main building has been converted today into a quiet hotel.\nIn February 1836, the Mendizabal Confiscation Ecclesiastical Act declared the sale of all property belonging to the regular clergy, and the proceeds were intended to amortize the debt. The decree was part of a program that sought to win the Carlist Civil War to raise funds and troops to restore confidence in the credit of the State and in the long term, allow for tax reform. Mendizabal, in the preamble, set out other basic objectives of the seizure: clean up the Hacienda and reduce debt, get access to the property of bourgeois sectors, which would improve production and revalue, and create a new social sector related to the system owners and to the side of Queen Cristina.\nSince it was abandoned in 1840, Pablo Muntadas Campeny, a Catalan wealthy merchant, bought the monastery, maintaining farming and livestock in the place. He was surprised by the cool environment in this dry remote rural area.\nHis son, Juan Federico Muntadas, shaped the park by making changes to paths and walkways and planting. Closest to the circuit of the 19th-century Spanish spas, and aware of the responsibility of conserving the landscape and the precarious state of the monastery, Campeny bought the abandoned monastery and its surroundings, and tried several viable businesses. These include a spa, a hotel and a salmon farm. In 1860, after discovering the Iris cave, it was opened to the public. In 1867, he created the first fish farm in Spain, and naturalized brown trout and Iberian crayfish in the waters of the Piedra River. Subsequently, in 1886, the Fisheries Centre of the Monasterio de Piedra was ceded to the Spanish Government. The center continues today to have rivers full of species for reforestation. The result of these activities is the garden that we know today was declared \"Paraje Pintoresco Nacional\" in 1940.\nDon Juan Federico Muntadas, founder and architect of the park, naturalized several salmonid species in the Piedra River. He explored the existing caves, cleaned and opened a path, and brought beautiful tree species, bearing a spa to the condition and use of medicinal waters spas of the era.\nThe church has three naves and its transept is very spoiled, especially the vaults, which fell completely following the abandonment bound by the confiscation. The Monasterio de Piedra is accessed by a medieval wall that stands as the medieval watchtower. The monastery's construction progressed in three architectural stages: Gothic (13th century), Renaissance Gothic (16th century) and Classical-Baroque (18th century).\nThe five apses with the semicircular central are important parts of the head. The western gate is well preserved, despite the shabby facade. It has the looks of a late Romanesque style, with pointed arches and teeth of a saw, much like other Cistercian monasteries.\nThe faculty is decidedly Gothic, with vaults and arches of great simplicity. The Chapter of the Monasterio de Piedra is probably very valuable, especially after its exemplary restoration that has returned all its glory. \nIt has a square. The vaults are ribbed pillars with multiple columns in the center (with traces of original paint) and supports the walls in the form of brackets. It is also has a dramatic faculty room with double lancet arches and pointed eyepiece multitude of elegant columns with vegetable-based \"crochets.\" \nOther preserved units that one should not fail to see are the monks kitchen, the refectory and the Cilla.\n\n\n== Park ==\nThe monastery is located near the Piedra River Canyon, home to many species of birds, damselflies, trout, and endangered fish like the South-west European nase and an endangered species of barbel. The canyon itself includes a network of mossy, garden-like caves (natural and man-made), waterfalls and lagoons that contrast with the otherwise dry hills of southern Aragon. The tallest waterfall is \"Horsetail\" (Cola del Caballo), more than fifty meters high. The dissolution and precipitation of local limestone has created numerous rivulets, springs, and Karst topography. The Piedra River meanders around a mountain known as \"El Espol\u00f3n\" (The Ram). In 1959, a dam was constructed across the river, which created the 1300 acre La Tranquera Reservoir, flooding part of the canyon, some of the best local farmland, and several villages. The roofs of some drowned houses can still be seen when the water levels are down. The reservoir provides domestic water supply, irrigation and electrical energy. The region is a popular tourist destination for hiking, camping, and water sports.\nThe native flora of the area includes oak, pine, holm and kermes oak, interspersed with meadows of lavender (Lavandula stoechas). There are cultivated almond trees, grape vines, and cherry trees. At elevations above 800 meters, the scrub oaks give way to forest vegetation, including maritime and Corsican pines, which have been cultivated throughout the 20th century. At lower elevations, there are also cultivated Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), walnut, horse chestnut, ash, maple, laurel, and cypress trees. Near the water there is a diverse flora, including willows, belfry, reeds (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifoli, Juncus articulatus, Juncus inflexus), grasses (Imperata cylindrica), yellow iris, poplar, tamarisk, plum feral, cherry feral, elms, vines (Clematis vitalba, Vitis vinifera, and ivy), wild roses, wild broom (Osyris alba), dewberries and blackberries.\nMany mammals live in the park, including foxes, beech marten, wild boars, rabbits, deer, badgers and genets, though not in large numbers. Bird species include colonies of vultures, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, hawks, kestrels, owls - especially Scops owls, partridges, quail, doves, larks, robins, and finches. Several European thrush species and the barbary dove are numerous enough to influence the dispersal of plants like Celtis australis, Cynanchum acutum, and bittersweet nightshade. The Tranquera Reservoir and Gallocanta Lagoon create marsh land, which are home to mallards, ducks, pochard, coots, teal, herons and cormorants. Frogs, painted frog, newts, lizards, and various kinds of snakes can be found here as well. The most common fish are trout, catfish and nase, and some areas are stocked with carp and rainbow trout. Local invertebrates include the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, tarantulas and other spiders, butterflies, Brachycera flies, damselflies and dragonflies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Bienes de Inter\u00e9s Cultural in the Province of Zaragoza\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMonasterio de Piedra\nParque Natural del Monasterio de Piedra",

        "wiki": "Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English) is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904, (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles).  The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population.\nThe city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace.\nTogether with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Caesaraugusta ===\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.In the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family. Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039, the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. The city control was held by Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Arag\u00f3n, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition: those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Early Modern history ===\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called mot\u00edn de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Late Modern history ===\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.Railway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The opening of the Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.The July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.Following the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.In 1979, the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental. ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.The municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2, making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulf\u00farica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is  also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 \u00b0C (112.1 \u00b0F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) during cold spells.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.The city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Log\u00edstica de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de G\u00e1llego.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercan\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga.\nOne of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.

        "wiki": "The Buenos Aires Underground (Spanish: Subterr\u00e1neo de Buenos Aires), locally known as Subte (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8su\u03b2te], from subterr\u00e1neo \u2013 'underground' or 'subterranean'), is a rapid transit system that serves the area of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first section of this network (Plaza de Mayo-Plaza Miserere) opened in 1913, making it the 13th subway in the world, and first underground railway in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Spanish-speaking world, with the Madrid Metro opening five years later, in 1919. As of 2015, Buenos Aires is the only Argentine city with a metro system, but there is a proposal to build a metro in the city of C\u00f3rdoba (the C\u00f3rdoba Metro), while a proposal to build a metro in Rosario was shelved in favour of a tramway network.Currently, the underground network's six lines\u2014A, B, C, D, E, and H\u2014comprise 56.7 kilometers (35.2 mi) of route that serve 87 stations. The network is complemented by the 7.4 km (4.6 mi) long Premetro line, and the 26 km (16 mi) long Urquiza suburban line, with 17 more stations in total. Traffic on lines moves on the left, because at the moment of system's open Argentina drove on the left. As of 2015, the underground also has 4 closed stations, and lines E and H are undergoing expansions. Over a million passengers use the network, which also provides connections with the city's extensive commuter rail and bus rapid transport networks.\nThe network expanded rapidly during the early decades of the 20th century; by 1944 its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s expansion resumed at a quicker pace, and four new lines were planned for the network. Despite this, the network's expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 new lines, F, G and I; and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the I line is postponed for future expansion, plus several other route amendments.\nThe entire network was nationalised in 1939, remaining in state hands and operation until the mid-1990s when it entered into a concession model. The previously state-operated lines were offered as 20-year concessions to interested private parties; the two complementary lines were also included in this privatisation and all have been operated by Metrov\u00edas since 1995, though the network and rolling stock remain the property of the City of Buenos Aires.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Subte opened in 1913, becoming the 13th underground system in the world, as well as the first in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Hispanophone world, followed by the Madrid Metro in 1919. The network was originally built and operated by three separate private companies and later nationalised in 1939. In 1952 it was absorbed by a unified state administration, in 1963 it became the property of a newly founded company, which changed hands in 1979. The Subte then entered into a concession model in the mid-1990s through which private sector parties were to submit bids to execute investment plans \"designed and funded\" by the state, while implemented by the concessionaire. All the Underground lines, along with the Urquiza Line and Premetro were offered as 20-year concessions to interested private parties. By 1995, Metrov\u00edas took over the Subte under a $395 million plan.\n\n\n=== Early days ===\n\nDiscussions on the need to build an underground transportation system in Buenos Aires began in the late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, which was one of the most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis exacerbated by the monopolisation of the lines, which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.In this context, the first proposals for the building of an underground system were made, along with requests for government grants: first, in 1886, and several more in 1889. However, the Ministry of Interior (Ministerio del Interior, in Spanish) denied the city administration the power to license building in the city's subsoil and for this reason, subsequent drafts were submitted directly to this ministry. In 1894, when it was decided to construct the Congress building in its present location, the underground idea was revived, since it would shorten the travel time between the Casa Rosada and the Congress. In 1896 Miguel Can\u00e9, former Mayor of Buenos Aires (1892\u20131893), expressed the need to build an underground railway similar to the one in LondonThere were numerous proposals at the time to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6-metre-high (20 ft) steel and iron posts positioned in 10-to-15-metre (33 to 49 ft) intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build, and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.The first Underground line was opened on 1 December 1913 and was built by the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company (AATC), which had been given permission to build in 1909. That line was made up of one of the existing sections of Line A, linking the stations of Plaza de Mayo and Plaza Miserere. 170,000 passengers took part in the line's first trip. On 1 April 1914 the line was to expand to R\u00edo de Janeiro station and on 1 July was extended to Primera Junta Station.In 1912 the Lacroze Hermanos company won a concession to build another Underground line. The company was a competitor to the Anglo-Argentine company, operating tramways in Buenos Aires as well as the Buenos Aires Central Railway, which later became part of the Urquiza Line. Construction began in 1927 and this line became Line B when it was inaugurated on 17 October 1930. During 17\u201318 December 380,000 passengers travelled on the line's then 32 cars. The line was originally intended to continue above ground, with the current Federico Lacroze station to be the central terminal of the Buenos Aires Central Railway (today the General Urquiza Railway), however nowadays the overground service forms part of the Urquiza Line instead.By the 1920s, the Argentine government was dissatisfied with the lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made in expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constituci\u00f3n and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compa\u00f1\u00eda Hispano\u2013Argentina de Obras P\u00fablicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constituci\u00f3n railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agust\u00edn P. Justo, then President of Argentina.CHADOPyF opened Line D in 1937, from Catedral through Tribunales; with Line E following later in 1944, from Constituci\u00f3n to San Juan y Urquiza, later joining with Boedo station. By this point the advent of the Second World War had slowed expansion significantly, but the network was 29 km (18 mi) in length with each of the three companies \u2013 unusually for an underground network \u2013 continuing to run their respective lines, which were financed entirely with private capital, unlike the country's railways which had been largely dependent on subsidies.\n\n\n=== Nationalisation ===\n\nThe entire network was centralised and nationalised in 1939 under the management of the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) and the lines were given their current lettered naming scheme, from A to D in the order in which the lines were opened. In 1952 the CTCBA was absorbed by the Buenos Aires Transport General Administration (AGTBA) and in 1963, the administration was dissolved and the Underground network became the property of the Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires company (SBA).In the early years of nationalisation, interchanges were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.Four different long-term expansion proposals were put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous lines to the network as well as extending the existing ones. Given the political instability characteristic of Argentina during this time, none of these proposals came to fruition, though aspects of them have been incorporated into contemporary expansion plans. One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city's commuter rail lines through tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires Underground, and while this was also shelved, it has been adapted into the current Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.During the 1960s and 70s, efforts were primarily concentrated on Line E, which was re-routed from its terminus at Constituci\u00f3n to the centre of the city at the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to boost passenger figures, something which proved to be successful. The segment was opened by president Arturo Illia in 1966 and Spain offered CAF-General El\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola trains in order to cancel part of the debt it had accrued with Argentina; trains which continue to serve on the line today. The line was extended westward to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moreno in 1973, in what would be the only expansion of the decade.\nIn 1979, SBA became Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires Sociedad del Estado (SBASE) under Buenos Aires mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore of the National Reorganisation Process military junta. After a long period of stagnation, the Underground began to be expanded again with Lines B and E within the scope of these plans, though only the extension of Line E was commenced and completed before the transition to democracy where expansion was once again stalled. During this time, four Premetro feeder lines were planned leading out from the western termini of Lines D and E as well as one in Puerto Madero, however only Line E2 was completed in 1987 and these plans were scrapped in 1994 when operation of the Underground changed hands.\n\n\n=== Privatisation ===\n\nIn 1994 the operation of the network was privatised, along with the country's railways, and is now managed by Metrov\u00edas. SBASE (as part of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires) maintained ownership the network, its rolling stock and infrastructure, and administers its expansion and budget. One cosmetic change carried out in the 1990s under private operation was the re-assignation of the colours of the lines, with Lines B and D switching colours, Line C changing from purple to blue and Line E changing from yellow to purple. The change of colours was also accompanied by a standardisation of the network's signage to match the new schemes.In 2012, the role of Metrov\u00edas was lessened to simply operating the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri's mayoral administration and Metrov\u00edas became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. The relationship was further strained in 2013 when Metrov\u00edas' 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving the door open for a state-run or mixed operation. Among the public, privatisation has proved unpopular, with a survey carried out in 2015 indicating that 82% of passengers would like the Underground to be operated by the state instead of a private company.In more recent years, Line A and Line B have been extended westwards, adding a total of 4 stations to each line between 2003 and 2013. During the same period, Line H was opened 2007, making it the first completely new line on the underground since Line E, excluding the Premetro. There have also been significant modernisations of infrastructure, signalling systems, stations and the network's rolling stock.The current contract expires on 31 December 2019 with bids being prepared by:\nKeolis in partnership with Transport for London and Eduardo Eurnekian's Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica\nMetrov\u00edas in partnership with Deutsche Bahn\nRATP Group\n\n\n== Network and services ==\nThe network comprises six underground lines, labelled \"A\" to \"E\" and \"H\" and which are further identified by different colours, covering a total route length of 56.7 kilometers (35.2 mi) and serving 87 stations. There is also one surface 7.4-kilometer (4.6 mi) Premetro line with an additional 17 stations. Daily ridership was approximately 1.11 million in 2015. With the current usage patterns, the entire system is overstretched, and during weekdays overcrowded and with insufficient services. An expansion programme is underway, and it is expected to enlarge the network to 97 kilometers (60 mi) in the future. Similarly, new rolling stock has been incorporated across lines since 2013 to improve capacity and the last of the current orders are set to arrive in 2016 and followed by further orders of new rolling stock, which is expected to increase ridership figures to 1.8 million by 2019.\n\n\n=== Fares and operating times ===\n\nFares are AR$19.00 flat per trip on the Subte, though these can be as low as AR$11.40as 41st or more per trip depending on how many trips are made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$7.00., as the fare have been increased multiple time due to devalue of Argentine Peso. While tokens have been used in the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3\u20134 minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6 minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.Trains originally ran until 01:00, but following the privatisation of the service through concession to Metrov\u00edas, the company established an earlier closing time of 23:00 in 1994 to carry out works on the lines; this change was only meant to be temporary, but was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions as well as a campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 on weekdays and 3:00 on Fridays and Saturdays. These proposals have been rejected by Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced schedule is needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.The subte operations are radio-controlled and monitored remotely from the Metrov\u00edas Central Operations Post (PCO in Spanish). In it, 24 operators have been monitoring four of the six subway lines (lines C and H have separate monitoring) since 2001. As of 2015, last formations arrive at their respective terminals at approximately 11:30pm, where maintenance and cleaning operations take place until about 04:00am.\n\n\n=== Premetro ===\n\nThe PreMetro line E2 is a 7.4-kilometer (4.6 mi) tramway feeding Line E. The Premetro line opened in 1987. It carries approximately 2,300 passengers daily and is also run by Metrov\u00edas. In 2015, SBASE began making plans to refurbish and rebuild many of the stations, including a brand new central terminal, as part of a plan to modernise the network, which also intends to increase the amount of rolling stock in circulation. By the end of 2015, the Intendente Saguier terminal had been refurbished, though other works on the line were delayed.The Premetro was originally intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, the role of the network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.\n\n\n=== Urquiza Line ===\n\nL\u00ednea Urquiza (in English: Urquiza Line) is a 26-kilometer (16 mi) suburban electric commuter rail line originally designed to be part of the Underground system as part of Line B, and operated by the Underground operator Metrov\u00edas. As a result, it has similar characteristics to Line B, using third rail electrification and standard gauge as opposed to the broad gauge used in the Buenos Aires commuter rail network. It runs from the Federico Lacroze terminus in the barrio of Chacarita, to General Lemos terminus, Campo de Mayo in Greater Buenos Aires. The line is completely at grade (ground-level) and uses third rail current collection. It operates 20 hours a day, 7 days a week at 8-to-30-minute intervals. The Urquiza Line transported 15 million passengers in 2013.Originally the line was planned to run into the centre of Buenos Aires through a long tunnel. But when the tunnel was finally built in 1930, it ended up as the Line B. The access ramp still exists and is in use today, but for maintenance and storage purposes rather than for passenger services. The Urquiza Line itself opened in 1948, so suburban passengers travelling on the Underground's Line B have to transfer to the Urquiza Line at Federico Lacroze station, named after its builder, about 6 km (3.7 mi) from the city centre.\n\n\n== Stations and connections ==\n\nStations are listed from East to West or North to South. Stations in gray have yet to open. Stations in bold are the current termini. Small interchange icons indicate interchanges under construction\n\n\n=== Ghost stations ===\n\nThere are four ghost stations on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations \u2013 Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte \u2013 were closed in 1953 since stations in that part of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.The Line E stations were closed in 1966, after the line was re-routed from Constituci\u00f3n railway station (where it connected with Line C) closer to the centre of the city, leaving the San Jos\u00e9 vieja and Constituci\u00f3n stations out of the network, a move which tripled traffic on the line. The two stations have been used as workshops and storage areas in the past.At one point it was considered that the two former Line E stations and tunnels should be used for Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.\n\n\n== Expansion plans ==\nThroughout the past, there have been several plans to expand the Underground system as a whole. The underground's routes are said to spread out like \"branches of a tree\" from the Plaza de Mayo, something Miguel Delibes described as \"restrictive\". Current expansion efforts attempt to address those restrictions by creating more north\u2013south lines and moving termini away from the city centre. The current expansion plan was approved in the year 2000 under Law 670 and has seen the creation of Line H, as well as the extensions of Line A and Line B westwards. However, in 2015 an alternative plan has been proposed which would make numerous amendments to the Law 670 plan.\n\n\n=== Works in progress ===\n\n Line H's extensions to the north from Corrientes to Plaza Francia, serving intermediate stations at C\u00f3rdoba, Santa Fe and Las Heras, and south from Hospitales with stations at Nueva Pompeya and S\u00e1enz, were initiated with ground-breaking ceremonies on 17 January 2012. Since then, following concerns that the construction of Plaza Francia station would damage the natural beauty of the area surrounding the Recoleta Cemetery, the station was relocated to Facultad de Derecho next to the University of Buenos Aires's faculty of law, with the change delaying the opening of the station until 2018. Cordoba and Las Heras were opened in December 2015, while Santa Fe opened in mid-2016, providing the line with a connection to Line D. The 20 new Alstom trains to serve the expected increase in passenger numbers as a result of the connection with Line D began arriving in the country in 2015.\n\n\n=== Planned lines ===\n\nThe future expansion outlined in Law 670 sees the addition of three new lines. These lines' routes have already been approved by the Legislature of the City in Law 670. 39.3 km will be added to the network, expanding it to about 97 km in total length and providing several stations with various interchanges. This will also create new north\u2013south routes, resulting in an appropriate network to avoid the city centre.\nThe new lines will mean that more than two million inhabitants of Buenos Aires (accounting for about 70% of the city centre's population) will live within 400 metres of a metro station. The new lines will run between 56 new stations.\n Line F will run from Barracas to Plaza Italia in Palermo and will include 16 new stations. The planned route length of this line is 10.8 km. Construction is due to begin in 2020, once the northern extension of Line H is complete, and as originally planned, the line will have automatic trains and platform screen doors. Line G will connect Retiro and Caballito/Villa Crespo; 12.5 km long with 15 new stations. Originally, construction was due to start in 2012\u20132013, however city legislators opposed the turnkey construction proposed by Chinese firms since the total cost would have been 30% higher if it was done with local companies. After this, it was decided to prioritise the other construction projects in the network.\n Line I will run Parque Chacabuco to Ciudad Universitaria with 18 new stations. The route length is 12.6 km. The future of this line (which had the lowest priority in the expansion plans) is currently uncertain since it has been proposed that a Metrobus line be built instead, which would follow the same trajectory as the line.\n\n\n=== PETERS plan ===\n\nIn October 2015, the city of Buenos Aires together with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan Estrat\u00e9gico y T\u00e9cnico para la Expansi\u00f3n de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts and the need to adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, Line I is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro \u2013 a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.Such plans are subject to approval by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment of many of the current expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the Peters plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning that Line C's extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be redundant, and that the Retiro Norte node would also be made redundant by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.\n\n\n== Modernisation of existing lines ==\nMuch of the modernisation in recent years has centred around the Underground's rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular on Lines A and H. Along with this came the construction of new underground workshops and storage areas on lines A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities on Lines B and D.In September 2015, the president of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015\u20132019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, with the exception of Line E. Lines A and B are to receive Automatic Train Operation systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D is also to receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.Other works being carried out during this period include the improvement of disabled access in older stations, new ventilation systems on lines B, C and D, improvements in electrification (such as replacing overhead lines and substations) on lines A, B, C and D and the replacement of 14 km of track on Lines C and E. The total investment in this period for these new projects has been set at US$1.34 billion.\n\n\n=== Stations ===\n\nStarting in 2007, the network's stations began to receive technological updates ranging from Wi-Fi to interactive terminals. Through BA-WIFI (the citywide free internet service), passengers can use internet free of charge across all stations and aboard trains, though this has been delayed on Line A due to complications surrounding the line's age. There are also several \"digital spaces\" across the network and in its commercial galleries where seating areas are provided, along with recharging stations for mobile devices.In this period, there has also been widespread cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.\n\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\nThe Buenos Aires Underground has had among the longest serving and most varied rolling stock in the world, in part due to the network having been originally built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with the exception of a few UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro-Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.\n\n\n=== Current fleets ===\nIn more recent years, there have been moves towards greater modernisation and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which the government of the City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing the average age of the fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.The network's oldest cars \u2013 the La Brugeoise cars \u2013 were retired in 2013, while its historically most widely used cars \u2013 the Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel cars \u2013 were to be retired in 2015, though this was pushed back to June 2016 following delays on the opening of Santa Fe station on Line H. While there has been much movement of rolling stock, often in a \"hand-me-down\" manner from higher frequency lines to less used lines (the primary recipient being Line E), the transition to newer models has gone fairly smoothly, despite shortfalls in some lines following extensions. The Fiat-Materfer cars have been the primary stand-ins while the new trains arrive, though this role has also been filled by the Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel cars, delaying their retirement.Though Line A ran on a different voltage to the rest of the network, it was converted to the 1500 V used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960s rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan 300/400/500/900 series Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500 V, after which the entire network will be standardised.\n\n\n== Culture and heritage ==\nThe Buenos Aires Underground has historically been characterised by murals and other artistic works in its stations, making it a kind of museum throughout the system. These works, and a number of complete stations, are considered part of the cultural heritage of the city and several of them were declared National Historic Landmarks in 1997.\n\n\n=== National patrimony ===\n\nLine A is renowned for having kept its original 1913 rolling stock running on the line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service in the world at the time. They were built by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian rolling stock manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were originally designed to run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.\n\nIn March 2013, La Brugeoise subway carriages were replaced by new Chinese 200 Series rolling stock, just 11 months prior to their 100-year anniversary on the line. The original rolling stock has since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500 V to run tourist services on the line. During the festivities of the 100-year anniversary of the underground on 1 December 2013, many restored La Brugeoise trains circulated Line A and there was a symphonic orchestra at Plaza de Mayo station as well as free rides for the entire city in order to mark the event. Throughout the week that followed, there were also numerous displays and events across the different lines of the Underground.Currently, the Polvor\u00edn Workshop \u2013 originally inaugurated along with Line A \u2013 is being transformed into a museum to display artefacts and the former rolling stock of the Underground. The workshop also serves as the headquarters for the Association of Friends of the Tramway and many of the Underground's historical artefacts are stored there, such as the wooden UEC Preston \"palace cars\", which also make appearances on Line A during special occasions such as anniversaries and even the inauguration of president Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn in 1983, where he and other officials were transported from the National Congress to the Casa Rosada using these cars.\n\n\n=== Artwork and exhibits ===\n\nThe network has over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from historic murals to modern art. Styles also vary, from mosaic to fileteado, sculpture and installation pieces. Many stations are decorated with intricate ceramic tile work, some of which date back to 1913 when the Underground first opened its doors. Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Ra\u00fal Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.\n\n\n==== Line A ====\nThe oldest line on the network has maintained its original appearance from 1913 and 1914 on the Plaza de Mayo \u2013 Primera Junta segment following restoration works in 1988 for the 75th anniversary of the line and again in 2007. These older stations feature no advertisements, but instead have recreations of original advertisements from the early 20th century. The Line's newest segment, which runs from Pu\u00e1n to San Pedrito, displays more modern artworks, such as those by Uruguayan artist Guillermo Roux at San Jos\u00e9 de Flores station.\n\n\n==== Line B ====\nIn Tronador \u2013 Villa Ort\u00fazar station there are 18 stained glasses that refer to the history of the Villa Ort\u00fazar neighbourhood, where the station is located. In Los Incas \u2013 Parque Chas station there are murals related with different Pre-Columbian era civilisations are exhibited. In 2015, SBASE faced criticism for its incorporation of new artworks in multiple stations on the line. Many of these artworks were painted directly over tiles dating back to the 1930s when the line was opened by the Lacroze company, while others were completely removed and destroyed.\n\n\n==== Line C ====\nFrom Constituci\u00f3n to Diagonal Norte, the line features murals of Iberian landscapes created by Spanish artists such as Ignacio Zuloaga and Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza, which date back to the time of the line's opening by CHADOPyF. General San Mart\u00edn station includes photographic reproductions of the Museo de la Ciudad (City Museum) activities, photographic reproductions and images of the Plaza San Mart\u00edn and photographic reproductions of streets and building of the South zone of the city.\n\n\n==== Line D ====\nThe line's murals on its original Catedral \u2013 Palermo route date back to 1937 and 1940, and began to be restored in 2013. These include murals by Argentine artists Benito Quinquela Mart\u00edn in Plaza Italia station. There are also numerous showcase exhibits in its newer stations, with a series of ceramic reproductions by Ra\u00fal and Daniel De Francisco in Juramento station, ceramic reproductions of 4 murals made by Ra\u00fal Soldi in Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez station and showcases exposing works made in the Ceramic School No.1 in Olleros station Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n station was the network's first \"museum station\" and holds numerous exhibits, among them busts of key political and cultural figures in Argentine culture and history such as Jorge Luis Borges and Manuel Belgrano displayed in glass enclosures in its platform walls.\n\n\n==== Line E ====\nSome modern murals on the line include an homage to the 1996 Argentine film Moebius at San Jos\u00e9 station. The film used the line as its primary filming locations and the murals depict scenes from it. Recently opened Correo Central station has received an award from the Association of Structural Engineers in Argentina for the quality and creativity of the work.\n\n\n==== Line H ====\nThe newest line on the Underground has many Hermenegildo S\u00e1bat mural reproductions related to tango in all stations. Its numerous stations depict different tango singers and poets relating to the neighbourhoods in which they are situated. Santa Fe station was renamed to Santa Fe - Carlos J\u00e1uregui in 2017, in honour of LGBT rights activist Carlos J\u00e1uregui.\n\n\n=== Graffiti ===\n\nGraffiti on the Buenos Aires Underground became particularly prevalent in the late 2000s and early 2010s, and by 2013, four out of every five cars on the network had some degree of graffiti. By January 2015, all the painted cars had been cleaned by night-time cleaning teams using a product specially developed for SBASE which allowed the removal of graffiti without damaging the livery of the cars. Cleaning the 410 vandalised cars had cost the City of Buenos Aires AR$ 10.25 million, while a coat of anti-graffiti paint has been applied to the cars to make future cleaning easier using alcohol.SBASE, along with the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, have adopted a zero tolerance policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400\u20136000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often being made to clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.Painted cars were often worked on by organised groups in a \"whole car\" (graffiti jargon for covering the entire visible surface of the vehicle) manner, severely reducing visibility from inside the cars. Numerous arrests have been made on these groups which often consist of foreign nationals from countries such as Chile, Germany and France; two German nationals and a Chilean national were arrested in January 2016. One high-profile arrest of such a group saw four Argentines detained in 2015 after vandalising a 200 Series train on Line A. Their houses were subsequently raided, uncovering a vast collection of stolen Subte paraphernalia as well as documented evidence of their activities in the form of videos and photographs.According to Clar\u00edn, people from across the world have visited Buenos Aires with the sole purpose of \"bombing\" (painting cars in a clandestine manner), while competition among different groups exists in the form of greater points being earned for painting newer cars or the level of danger experienced. In most cases, the people involved are university educated and with stable employment. In January 2016, a group called Soketes Calcetines was discovered to be offering tourists graffiti tours of the Underground, giving them a chance to paint cars for a fee. The group documented their activities and uploaded them to YouTube in order to promote the business, which has been subsequently shut down with its members arrested.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe Buenos Aires Underground is featured in the 1996 science fiction film Moebius directed by Gustavo Mosquera. In the film, the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of an underground train are investigated by a topologist. The film is based upon the short story, \"A Subway Named M\u00f6bius\" that takes place in the Boston Subway.Other films with scenes shot in the Underground include Highlander II: The Quickening, Focus and The Official Story.In Ricardo Piglia's 1997 novel Plata Quemada, the bank robber protagonists enjoy riding the underground regularly. In Ernesto Sabato's novel On Heroes and Tombs, Fernando, one of its main characters, develops a paranoia with blind people in the underground.One of Jorge Luis Borges' earlier editorial jobs was for Urbe, a promotional magazine for the underground system, which was privately owned at that time. In the magazine, he wrote several articles on sci-fi topics under various pseudonyms.Line B and some of its stations feature heavily in the 2013 Argentine point-and-click adventure game Reversion: The Meeting.El Eternauta is a science fiction comic book created by H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld and Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez in 1957. The story is about an alien invasion in Buenos Aires. Part of the action takes place at the Plaza Italia station, as the heroes try to use the tunnel to escape from the aliens, and successfully exploit the weakness of the alien leader to kill him. The comic book, published in the 1950s, made reference to the \"Canning\" station, a former name of the Scalabrini Ortiz station.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Buenos Aires Underground stations\nList of Latin American rail transit systems by ridership\nList of metro systems\nRail transport in Argentina\nTrams in Buenos Aires\nTransport in Argentina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInteractive Buenos Aires Underground Map (in Spanish)\nBuenos Aires Cuidad Subte \u2013 Official Page (in Spanish)\nMetrov\u00edas  \u2013 Official Page (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "Pablo Luna Carn\u00e9 (May 21, 1879 Alhama de Arag\u00f3n \u2013 January 28, 1942 Madrid) was a Spanish composer. His best-known composition is the aria \"De Espa\u00f1a vengo\" from the zarzuela El ni\u00f1o jud\u00edo.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPablo Luna received his first lessons in music theory from an organist at a church in his birthplace, Alhama de Arag\u00f3n. His father, Pablo Luna Ferrer, who was a member of the Civil Guard, had moved with his family to the valley of the Ebro. He studied harmony with Teodoro Ballo and composition with Miguel Arnaudas. As a violinist, Luna would make money in hotels, cafes, churches and a small chamber orchestra, as well as in theaters. In 1903 he wrote his first operetta, Lolilla, la Petenera which was followed in 1904 by La Escalera de los Duendes (The Ladder of the Elves).\nIn 1905, he moved to Madrid to learn more about the world of zarzuela. In particular, he contacted Ruperto Chap\u00ed, the second director of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, and Tom\u00e1s Barrera Saavedra, a later director of the orchestra, Jer\u00f3nimo Gim\u00e9nez y Bellido and others. He also knew the librettist Luis Pascual Frutos, who wrote the libretto for the operetta Mussetta, which premiered successfully in 1908. This operetta was followed by many other stage works.\nIn Zaragoza premiered with great success 11 March 1911 his zarzuela Molinos de viento (Windmills). Luna was the same who led the orchestra on the night of reopening of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, after a fire, in 1914. In 1918, he released one of his greatest works, El ni\u00f1o Jud\u00edo (The Jewish Boy), an exponent of the new style full of exoticism and sophistication. In March 1925 a grand concert was given in his honor and he was awarded the gold medal of the city of Zaragoza. He closed the trilogy of his three most successful zarzuelas with Benamor (1928).\nHe also wrote eleven screenplays under the pseudonym Garc\u00eda Sandoval. Pablo Luna has various streets named after him, and has a school with his name in Alhama de Arag\u00f3n (Zaragoza).\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Works for orchestra ===\nUna noche en Calatayud, suite-fantas\u00eda\n\u00a1Arre borrico!, jota\n\n\n=== Works for band ===\nBallesteros, paso-doble jota\nDanza del Fuego from \"Benamor\"\nFantas\u00eda from \"Molinos de viento\"\nIntermedio from \"La P\u00edcara Molinera\"\nSelecci\u00f3n from \"El Asombro de Damasco\"\nSelecci\u00f3n from \"El ni\u00f1o jud\u00edo\"\nSelecci\u00f3n from \"Una noche en Calatayud\"\n\n\n=== Theatrical works ===\nRevistas\n\n1909 A.C.T., Que se va el t\u00edo, (with Tom\u00e1s Barrera Saavedra)\n1909 El Club de las solteras, Pasatiempo c\u00f3mico-L\u00edrico in 1 act and 5 scenes, with libretto by Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez del Puente, (with Luis Foglietti)\n1911 El paraguas del abuelo, cuento fant\u00e1stico in 1 act (with Tom\u00e1s Barrera Saavedra) -

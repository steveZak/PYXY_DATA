        "wiki": "Beirut ( bay-ROOT; Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e, romanized: Bayr\u016bt; French: Beyrouth, pronounced [b\u025b\u0281ut]) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. No recent population census has been conducted, but 2007 estimates ranged from slightly more than 1 million to 2.2 million as part of Greater Beirut, which makes it the third-largest city in the Levant region and the fifteenth-largest in the Arab world. Located on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast, Beirut is an important regional seaport.\nIt is one of the oldest cities in the world, having been inhabited for more than 5,000 years.  The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the Amarna letters from the New Kingdom of Egypt, which date to the 15th century BC.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with most banks and corporations based in its Central District, Badaro, Rue Verdun, Hamra, Ryad el Soleh street, and Achrafieh. Following the destructive Lebanese Civil War, Beirut's cultural landscape underwent major reconstruction. Identified and graded for accountancy, advertising, banking, finance and law, Beirut is ranked as a Beta World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayr\u016bt (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French occupation. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician Berot or Birut (\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd15\u200e Brt). This was a modification of the Canaanite and Phoenician word be'rot, meaning \"the wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The etymology is shared by the biblical Beeroth (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea) which was, however, a different settlement somewhere near Jerusalem. The name is first attested in the 15th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.The Greeks hellenised the name as B\u0113ryt\u00f3s (Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nBefore, under the Seleucid Empire, the city had been already founded and known as Laodicea in honour of the mother of Seleucus the Great. It was distinguished from several other places named in her honour by the longer names Laodicea in Phoenicia (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u1fc3, romanized: Laod\u00edkeia h\u0113 en Phoin\u00edk\u0113i) or Laodicea in Canaan (Phoenician: \ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd03\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd00 \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd14 \ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd0d, romanized: Ll\u02bedk\u02be \u02be\u0161 bkn\u02bfn).\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nBeirut was settled more than 5,000 years ago and the area had been inhabited for far longer. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Fran\u00e7ais in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.Beirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.Beirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticised by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area.Beirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.Beirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.Beirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement was on an easily defended island in the river that, however, progressively silted up and joined it to the mainland. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, and Ottoman remains.\n\n\n=== Phoenician period ===\n\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorisation was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\n\n=== Hellenistic period ===\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon in his contest with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the end of the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of this Hellenistic period. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control, however after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, veteran soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken.Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions. Consequently, the city quickly became fully Romanized: it was one of four Roman colonies (coloniae) in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation.\nIts territory under Claudius reached the Bekaa valley and included Heliopolis (Baalbek): it was the only mostly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia region, because it was settled by Roman colonists who even promoted agriculture in the fertile lands around Yammoune. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony. Its law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught there under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire. After the 551 Beirut earthquake the students were transferred to Sidon.The post-war salvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. Prince Arslan bin al-Mundhir founded the Principality of Sin el Fil in Beirut in 759. From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon, which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon, today's Lebanon. As a trading centre of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was overshadowed by Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197.  John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204.  He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512\u20131520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks.\nAfter Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\n\n==== Vilayet of Beirut ====\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Dr. Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\nThese families are:\n\nAll other families of Beirut are considered to have descended from one of those seven main branches, such as Nahhas, Yanout Inkidar, Hajjal, Hamza and others who derived from the Sinno Family (p. 14).\nSinno is considered to be an old family in Beirut, descending from the Muslim Leader Tareq Bin Ziyad.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Capital of Lebanon ====\n\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975\u20131976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city has somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has been host to the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960\u20131964, 1999, 2001\u20132002.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.In the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) characterised by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, winter is mild and rainy. Summer is hot and can be virtually rainless and very dry although it can get very muggy, especially in August. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October - April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public garden ( sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact concrete roofs cover 80% Of the capital area.\n\n\n=== Quarters and sectors ===\n\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikha\u00ebl)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRemeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-BlatThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs.Badaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favourite hip nightlife destination.Two of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more common.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. The city boasts significant Muslim and Christian communities. In Beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups. At the end of the civil war the Copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. The original seventeen included four Muslim sects: Shi'a, Sunni, 'Alawi, and Druze; Twelve Christian sects: Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholics, Protestant Evangelicals, and other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, Assyrians (Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic), Copts; and Jews (very few remain in Lebanon today, but children of Lebanese Jewish parents may register as citizens at Lebanese Embassies.) Briefly, Christians are 52% of Beirut, Muslims 47%, and 1% others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognised by Lebanese civil authorities.\nBefore the civil war the neighbourhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict.  East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. The southern suburbs are populated largely by Shia Muslims, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian.\nThe city is also home to a small number of Latin Rite Roman Catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with Archbishop Paul Dahdah, OCD, as the apostolic vicar.\n\n\n== Beirut Central District ==\n\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country.\" It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, F\u00eate de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticised for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down  \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.Finally, the actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. With its seaport and airport\u2014coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates\u2014Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban, Lebanon's central bank, the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\n\n=== Banking and finance ===\n\nThe Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East,\" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).The largely pedestrianised Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-fa\u00e7ade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouch\u00e9, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouch\u00e9 Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighbourhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighbourhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighbourhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming caf\u00e9 and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.  There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath caf\u00e9s of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.Hamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighbouring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic Bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighbourhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colourful and chic caf\u00e9s amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totalling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.Many of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighbouring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organised, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialised procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International organisations ===\nThe city is home to numerous international organisations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes.\nThe American University of Beirut and Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph (USJ), are the oldest respectively English medium and French medium universities in the country.\nThe Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to the Lebanese American University (LAU), which is also, together with many of its programs, accredited by US bodies and considered lately one of the top universities in the Middle East. Beirut is also home to the American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), as well as the Notre Dame University \u2013 Louaize (NDU), Universit\u00e9 La Sagesse (ULS).\nNotre Dame University (NDU)'s degrees are becoming more and more valuable with time. NDU received its accreditation from NIASC in 2015.\nThe Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing the university colleges, university institutes and universities in Beirut and nationwide.Among the private secondary schools in Beirut are, College Saint Joseph Antoura, Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais, Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame de Jamhour, College Melkart, Carmel Saint-Joseph, Coll\u00e8ge Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Nazareth, Coll\u00e8ge du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Gemmayz\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge Protestant Fran\u00e7ais, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by ferry from Cyprus via the nearby city of Jounieh or by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC \u2013 \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.The ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.Beirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilisations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading centre of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.Beirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighbouring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.Planet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.In October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels\u2014priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a pterodactyl is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" \u2013 an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish\u2019n\u2019Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of M\u00e9moire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life \u2013 a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year.

          "A great museum, beautifully presented with iconic artifacts all of which have great explanations in several languages. An easy way to spend a half day, but don't waste money or time on a guide as at $45 its not worth it and better to take your time over the artifacts you want to",
          "Unmissable!! An important way to get to know all people that passed by Lebanon in the last 9.000 years. It's also fun to visit the Museum before travelling to archeological sites such as Baalbek and Byblos, you get there already knowing who walked those paths and built those",
          "as the mother land of the Phoenician, I will expect more info about the history and what influence it has imposed on the world. There may be such info in the exhibition but probably buried in the thesis-like write up on the wall. It is not well curated and I am expecting this to",

          "Although it is not very big, this museum goes through milleniums of history and how Lebanon\u2019s area fits in all of it. I think a guided tour is better for people who don\u2019t already know a bit about Lebanon\u2019s history. Keep in mind that we are talking Phoenician until modern roman",
          "As you walk in, look to the right and at every hour (on the hour) there is a short video explaining how the museum protected exhibits etc during the war (before you pay your entrance fee!) For me this made the visit all the more interesting and would recommend it.",
          "This is a great place. Not very big, but has a lot of objects. As most of it is archlogical, I recommend going there with a guide though. Otherwise I don\u2019t think that you would get much out of it.",

          "We stopped by here on our way back to the airport. For a history buff, there is so much to see. The AV presentation, is more to do about the museum itself - how it got curated and stuff. There is so much to see. and I believe there is more being that construction is still",

          "So. This is not the Louvre, most artifacts were saved from the war of 1975-1991. We were AMAZED by the intricacy of statues found at the necropolis in Tyre, or the oldest city of Byblos. Beautifully detailed....and so thankful they were saved. Thankful that the museum wa",

          "We came to the museum the day after our visit to Byblos where our guide told us all about the site and what we would see in the museum. It was nice to see all he told us about in Byblos and recognise it all.",
          "This is a very special place. Set over three floors there are some spectacular exhibits but this is all in the detail. The roman mosiacs are almost liquid in their beauty, the stunning display of sarcophagus are breath taking ( arranged in rows with mirrors , the face are",
          "Considering Lebanon is a living museum in itself, the museum is surprisingly quite empty. There is so much in Lebanon likely yet to be discovered so im optimistic that the National Museum will grow in time, and it seems to lack a 'National Treasure' item, or key piece. There",
          "Honestly, the university (AUB) archeological museum is of similar quality to this, and free and in the city centre. Full of treasures and it all looks amazing. About $7 Uber from Bliss St. But hard to get to and no cafe or facilities. I wouldn't rush out to get here if you had",
          "The exhibitions are on 3 floors. It has a range of exhibits from Phoenician Sacrophages on the basements, to coins on the first floor. There is a charge of 5000 LP, but it is worth it. Many of the exhibits are unique and interesting.",

          "This museum is a jewel not to be missed. There are two floors and a view of the current archeological dig outside the first floor. The first floor contains large stonework like sarchophagi, mosaics, stele and other works of art. Upstairs are the smaller items like jewelry,",

          "It is am absolute miracle that the museum has survived through the civil war, Israeli invasion, many local battles, etc. It is a symbol of Lebanese history with the many cultures and civilizations which passed through, or ruled, and left a historical print in Lebanon. There are",

          "So, as many times as I have been to Byblos, it was educational to see artifacts that had come from Byblos and carefully restored. Same for the wonderful sarcophagi from Tyre. They do NOt take dollars so be prepared w LBP. They are strict about closing at 5. Parking may be a",

          "For starters, the building was lovely. The downside was that this was a archaeology history museum and not the history of Lebanon. If you're going here to find out about the history of the country then this will do little to help. Only 5000LBL to enter so a very cheap way to",
          "If you ever visit Beirut, one of the places that you have to see is the national museum. You can have an idea how old this city is. Check the film about how some pieces were protected during the civil war.",

          "This museum is a gem. It's not that large, but contains a number of truly stunning pieces. There is a special poignancy and power to the collections arising from the way they survived the ravages of the civil war, and the story of this, including examples of damage to exhibits",

          "I'm a Lebanese citizen and it was my first time at the museum in Beirut! My cousin is visiting from the USA and we decided to go there. Amazing! Well preserved national treasures that survived the civil war. Sarcophagi, mummies, mosaic, ancient pottery, jewellery, coins... a",

          "I planned to spend perhaps a half hour and wound up spending 90 minutes. There is a short video which explains the work that went on to restore the museum and art works due to the civil war, I found it added greatly to my understanding of the exhibits. The museum makes",

          "As someone of Lebanese heritage, it's not often that I get to brag about something the country has done exceptionally well, but the National Museum is definitely such an opportunity. The collection is absolutely amazing, and the presentation is truly world class. I encourage",
          "We visited this lovely museum. Helps to understand the vast history of Lebanon. Has a small entrance fee of about $3. Do not miss the downstairs as we nearly did. Well worth the visit and takes about 1-2 hours.",

        "wiki": "The Sursock family (also spelled Sursuq) is a Greek Orthodox Christian family from Lebanon, and one of the most important \u201cSeven Families\u201d of Beirut. Having originated in Constantinople during the Byzantine Empire, the family has lived in Beirut since 1714, when they began to establish significant positions of power within the flourishing Ottoman Empire. The family, through lucrative business ventures, savvy political maneuvering, and strategic marriages, embarked on what Leila Fawaz called \"the most spectacular social climb of the nineteenth century,\" and, by their peak, had built a close network of relations to the families of Egyptian, French, Irish, Russian, Italian and German aristocracies, alongside a manufacturing and distribution empire spanning the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Sursocks were one of Beirut's aristocratic Christian families that moved freely in Ottoman, Egyptian and European high societies. The Sursocks were an integral part of an international bourgeoisie centered in Alexandria, Beirut, Cairo, Istanbul, Paris and Rome. They were one of the \"Seven Families\" in Beirut's aristocratic nobility. Their wealth and sophistication are also reflected in their residences,  equal in elegance to any Italian palazzo, which remained largely unscathed despite fifteen years of  mortar fire and violence.In the 17th century, members of the Sursock family served as tax collectors and held other key positions on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, they benefitted greatly from the 1858 Ottoman land reforms, during which they acquired large tracts of fertile land in Palestine and Syria, in addition to extensive holdings from Egypt to Beirut. \nThe means by which this Greek-Orthodox Ottoman family came into possession of such particularly palatial real estate were multiple. As a long line of land owners and tax collectors, the Sursocks were able to leverage their finances and capital using their connections to American, Russian, German and French consuls over the decades to establish extensive economic and political connections.\nThe family developed wide social ties and was close to key Ottoman and European figures, frequently playing host to a wide range of royals and diplomats, including King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, William I, Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, amongst other monarchs.The Sursocks built their fortune through their successful manufacturing and transportation empire, which extended from Turkey to Egypt and ultimately to the United Kingdom. Dimitri Sursock was the founder of \"Sursock and Brothers,\" a prominent firm in nineteenth century Beirut which acted as an agent for Lascaridi and Company in the 1850s and 1860s and shipped grain to London, Cyprus and throughout Europe. The firm and its assets were subsequently taken over by his sons after his death: Nicolas, Moussa, Loutfallah, Khalil, Ibrahim and Joseph.In addition to their manufacturing and export activities, the family increased its fortune as landowners in the Ottoman Levant, amassing profits from both rent and tax collection, as well as from the sale of their many properties. Based in Beirut, the family owned many properties along the Mediterranean region, and, for over one hundred years, the Sursocks owned a significant amount of real estate in the heart of Mersin, Turkey, including many shops and properties in the eponymous Sursock Quarter of the city. Their financial activities were wide-ranging, and included shipping and the production of silk and other goods built for transport to London and throughout the region.\nThe Sursocks also became heavily involved in banking in Egypt and Lebanon, where they helped finance major projects including the Suez Canal, the Beirut-Damascus highway, and the Beirut Harbour Company. The family also served as direct creditors to Ismail Pasha and other members of Egyptian royalty, who soon found themselves heavily involved with and indebted to the family. As a result of their extensive financial activities, the family was branded \"the Rothschilds of the East,\" and indeed engaged the Rothschild banking family during their sale of the Jezreel Valley to the Jewish National Fund in 1906. The Sursocks are recorded as having been deeply intertwined in Freemasonry at the time, under the Grand Orient of France, with many speculating on the reasons behind the family's rise. George Dimitri Sursock, Worshipful Master of the Grand Orient lodge, recorded his extensive dealings with, and on behalf of, the masonry.However, members of the family also gained notoriety for taking advantage of the famine in Lebanon during the First World War by selling overpriced basic food supplies, and for selling large swaths of Arab land in Palestine to Jewish settlers, who demanded the oftentimes forceful eviction of the peasant residents.In the wake of the Lebanese Civil War many members of the family  relocated to various European and Asian capitals, but Lady Cochrane Sursock remained in Beirut as the family matriarch. Despite the vast damage  to Beirut during the conflict, the main Sursock residence lies untouched alongside buildings whose outer walls bear scars caused by years of violence.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor many decades, the Sursocks were Lebanon's leading business family. As business partners of the Otis Elevator Company, they were successful industrialists and played a key role in the development and manufacturing of elevators.The Sursocks have shaped Lebanon's history from the late Ottoman period to present; indeed, the selection of Beirut, which would come to be known as the 'Pearl of the Orient,' as the provincial capital was in no small part the result of their entreaties to the Porte.According to Lady Cochrane Sursock, daughter of Alfred Bey Sursock and Donna Maria Teresa Serra di Cassano, the name is a corruption of \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u0399\u03c3\u03b1\u03b1\u03ba (\"Kyrie Isaac\", meaning Lord Isaac).  The family left Constantinople at its fall in 1453, settling near Byblos. Other sources list the name as having been derived from the Arabic phrases for \"secrets\" and \"market.\"\nTowards the close of the 18th century the Sursock family then moved to Beirut where they subsequently became successful traders, exporting grain from the east Mediterranean to the United Kingdom, whilst also engaging in the import of textiles from Europe to be sold throughout the Middle East. Nicolas Sursock founded the Banque Sursock et Fr\u00e8res in 1858 and purchased extensive properties throughout different parts of the Ottoman Empire.The Sursocks soon became prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and dragomen to numerous European and American consul-generals and were afforded political privileges and protection by the various countries with whom they had ties, including Russia,  Germany, Greece, Ireland and the United States of America. Moussa Sursock, the 8th Duke of Cassano, his brothers and his father Alfred are reported to have travelled on Greek and Russian passports as well as to have gained prot\u00e9g\u00e9 status with other European consulates in Beirut as a result of their wide-ranging activities. Furthermore, the Sursocks' heavy involvement in Egyptian affairs allowed the family to form close relations with members of the monarchy including Khedive Sa'id of Egypt, who reigned from 1854 to 1863, and his nephew Isma'il Pasha (1863-1879), affording them preferential deals on large infrastructural projects and extravagant public works.\n\nThe Sursocks\u2032 success was measured by their admission to the highest circles of both the Ottoman and European elite political spheres. They formed close connections with officials in Istanbul, while aristocrats often approached them to intercede on their behalf with the Ottoman government. One sign of their intimacy with the sources of Ottoman power was the appointment of Alfred Sursock to the post of secretary at the Ottoman embassy in Paris in 1905, who then joined Moussa, Michel and Yusuf Sursock in taking seats within the Ottoman power structure. In addition to connections with Paris, a French report written the following year listed Moussa Sursock as dragoman of the German Consul, and a year later, Mathilde Sursock married Alberto Theodoli, the Italian president of the League of Nations Permanent Mandates Commission, in Paris, thereby extending the family's reach around the Mediterranean. Further evidence of the Sursocks' influence can be found in the court accounts recorded under Russian Grand Duke Nicolai Nikolaevich, identifying Nicolas Sursock, who had long maintained a strong relationship with the court, as an \"Honorary Dragoman\" of Russia.\nAlfred, meanwhile, moved throughout the titled circles of Europe and married Donna Maria Teresa Serra di Cassano, daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano, who came from an old Italian princely family from Naples. Their daughter Yvonne would be known as Lady Cochrane after marrying Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Baronet, bearing four children.\nMichel Sursock, a deputy to the Ottoman parliament, became infamous during the great famine in the First World War for hoarding grain and speculating on the supply. He would not sell the grain, which cost 40 piastres in peacetime, for less than 250 piastres.\n\n\n== Assets ==\nBeirutWhen Moussa Sursock died in 1890, his grand share of the Sursock family assets was divided amongst his brothers, nephews, wife, three sons and five daughters. The assets left to the family included a wide range of real estate in and around Beirut, Mersin (Adana, Turkey), Tartus (Syria) and Alexandria (Egypt) which afforded the heirs significant influence over the region. Moussa also passed on extensive rural holdings, including entire villages in Egypt and Palestine, land situated on Mount Lebanon and, notably, a chateau that would become the fashionable resort of Sofar on Mount Lebanon.The Sursock villa in Sofar, constructed in the early twentieth century by Alfred Sursock for his wife Donna Maria di Cassano, bears original foundation inscriptions that proclaim the wealth of these merchants-turned-aristocrats. Though this Greek Orthodox family of foreign proteges often adopted the style and manners of French and other European elite, the Arabic inscriptions indicate deep traces of an Ottoman alliance stretching back centuries.Nicolas Sursock built himself a spectacular private villa in 1912 and decreed in his will that the villa be transformed into a museum after his death. Thus, when he died in 1952 the villa was bequeathed to the city of Beirut. The Sursock mansion,  built in 1912, is an exceptional, pearl white structure at the top of a hill in Beirut's luxurious Achrafieh neighbourhood. Bringing out the best of both Venetian and Ottoman architecture, the building is a pool of influences, not dissimilar to the capital itself. Originally the residence of aristocratic art-lover Nicolas Sursock, it was bequeathed to the city on his death in 1952. The Sursock Museum collection consists of 5,000 pieces, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, and iconography, all of which date back to the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The Sursock Museum building embodies Lebanese architecture with its Italianate, specifically Venetian, and Ottoman architectural influences.\nThe museum is currently undergoing an extensive US$12 million renovation led by French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte and Lebanese architect Jacques Aboukhaled.Rue Sursock, in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, is named after the family, which owned and continues to own palatial homes on the street, such as Sursock House. Lady Cochrane Sursock, who in 1946 married Sir Desmond Cochrane, is the owner of the Sursock House, as well as a vast amount of property along Rue Sursock, up to the fashionable Rue Gouraud. Nicolas Sursock transformed the house into a museum of art and amassed a large collection of art and glass. But it was Lady Cochrane's father, Alfred Bey Sursock, who initially expanded the size of the Sursock palace gardens and contributed most to the collections of art, carpets and other exquisite items, which are amongst the finest and best preserved in the Middle East. The palace is also home to a large collection of Italian artwork from the 16th and 17th centuries, many contemporary Lebanese pieces and antique Lebanese jewelry.In 1918, the Sursock family financed the building of the Beirut Hippodrome. Alfred Sursock, who funded the endeavor, agreed to a deal with the city of Beirut regarding the development of 600,000 square meters in Beirut's pine forest. The Hippodrome project was to include a public causeway, a movie theater and a casino in addition to the hippodrome itself. The hippodrome complex was ultimately built in 1921, with the casino eventually becoming the seat of the French Mandate Authorities in Lebanon.\nThe Sursocks had also previously built Lebanon's first casino, the Sawfar Grand Hotel, in the late 1880s.In 1882, a consortium headed by the Sursock family won an Ottoman concession for the construction of a railway across the Jezreel Valley. The family sought to build a railway there both to raise land value around the line, which was mostly family-owned, and to enjoy economies of scale in the transport of goods from the Hauran, also owned by the family, to the Mediterranean Sea for export.\nIn 1883, Sir Laurence Oliphant founded a company along with Gottlieb Schumacher, one of the founders of the German Colony of Haifa, to find investors for attaining a construction permit for the Sursock family, and capital for the construction itself.\nOn June 13, 1883, early surveying work was completed and Oliphant began to look for investors, both in Britain and Germany. In a letter he wrote to the Duke of Sutherland, Oliphant claimed that the construction of the line was extremely important both politically and economically, that it would eventually serve as the connection between Asia Minor, the Fertile Crescent, and Egypt, and expressed fear that the line would be under sole German ownership. Oliphant and his peers advertised the line as extremely profitable for investors, estimating the gain at 34%, and promising additional permits to construct additional extensions, a modern port in Haifa or Acre, and a shipping company. For that purpose, Oliphant purchased additional lands on Haifa's coast, and in the Megiddo area.\nDespite these efforts, the plans failed \u2014 the British government, the only one interested in the project, sent the Duke of Sutherland to inspect it, who refused to help sponsor the project. The Lebanese families headed by Mr. Sursock, who wished to build the railway for their personal needs, instead saw their permit and subsequent deposit with Sultan Abdul Hamid II  expire two years later.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\n\nMichel Sursock was a high-ranking member of Ottoman parliament and a senior dragoman to the Persian Empire, having been granted the title \"Senator of the Empire.\"  Similarly, Moussa, Michel-Ibrahim and Yusuf Sursock all served as members of Ottoman parliament for a number of years, beginning in 1912.Girgi Dimitri Sursock (1852-1913), married Marie Assad ZAHAR, dragoman at the German General Consulate in Beirut. He was decorated with the Order of Osmanieh. He publishes several books, including \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 and \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a. He is in contact with many intellectuals of al-Nahda, but also with foreign scientists, including the orientalist Martin Hartmann. Freemason, he was for many years the Worshipful Master of \u201cLe Liban\u201d Lodge in Beirut.\nGeorge Moussa Sursock had developed close ties with a wide variety of rulers and members of Europe's monarchy, from Franz Joseph of Austria to William of Germany and Louis Prince of Battenberg. Moussa was also involved in Freemasonry, as is evidenced in archives and letters addressed to the Grand Orient in Paris, dated April 1906, as well as in other sources such as \"Les Grandes Families.\" Alfred Bey Sursock married Donna Maria Teresa Serra, daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano. His daughter Yvonne married the British aristocrat Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Bart. and became known as Lady Cochrane Sursock. His first cousin Nicolas married Alfred\u2032s sister-in-law Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano, also a daughter of the Duke. Nicolas\u2032 eldest sister married Marchese Alberto Theodoli, and his youngest, Isabelle, married the head of the Colonna family, an ancient Roman family whose history spans nine hundred years.Catherine Aleya Beriketti Sursock, who was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1938 and was formerly the wife of Lebanese aristocrat Cyril Sursock (son of Nicolas Sursock and Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano), married Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan in November 1972 in the British West Indies. (His father, Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III is said to have traced his bloodline to the Prophet Muhammad and was the leader of the Ismailis, who form the second largest branch of Shia Islam). \nThe Prince's marriage to Catherine brought with it three sons: Alexandre Sursock, who married Thai  Mom Rajawongse Charuvan Rangsit Prayurasakdi, Marc Sursock and Nicolas Sursock.Alexandre Sursock, son of Cyril Sursock, married Princess Mom Rajawongse Charuvan Rangsit of Thailand (by Mom Nalini) on 9 September 1978.Michail (Michael) Sursock is a leading figure in Asia's Private Equity and financial sphere, where he continues to serve as an adviser to numerous companies, having built his name as a leader of several multinational businesses across Europe, America and Asia. Michail has spent time as CEO of KKR Capstone for Asia Pacific, as a Managing Director at Motorola Inc, and as a President with Mars across three continents. Additionally Mr. Sursock is an Advisor and Speaker at the Tuck School of Leadership Dartmouth  and a member of its Asia Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Marshall Goldsmith Leadership 100.\nRobert Sursock, over many decades, established himself as a premier banker in Paris and beyond, having built and grown such institutions as PrimeCorp Finance, Gazprombank Invest Mena and Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Invessement.Cairo's most famous restaurant entrepreneur, Nicha Sursock, the co-owner of world-renowned restaurant and bar \"L'aubergine\", is also a member of the prominent Greek Orthodox family, while Cici Tommaseo Sursock was a renowned artist having hosted exhibitions throughout the world, including in Lausanne, Beirut, Cairo, New York, Rome.Isabelle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sursock fell in love with Prince Marcantonio VII Colonna, who brought her to Italy, where she was able to integrate successfully into Roman high society at a time when it was up against the rise of Mussolini. After the fall of the monarchy, Isabelle effectively replaced queen Marie Jos\u00e9 as the substitute queen of Italy, hosting regal receptions where royalty and, among the bourgeoisie, only financiers and bankers were allowed.Donna Isabelle, as she then became known, occupied a prime position amongst the \u00e9lite of Roman society throughout her long life up to the 1980s, and was a lady of great intelligence and power who intensely guarded the artistic collection of the family throughout the darkest periods of both world wars, shielding persecuted Jews and resisting the fascist powers wherever possible. She and her husband were immensely loyal to the Holy See, so much so that she was given the rare honor of Vatican citizenship.The \"alternate queen,\" as she was known in Italy's elite circles, never abandoned her palace (Palazzo Colonna), which she so profoundly loved, and continued to weave her diplomatic skills at the highest level, receiving heads of state and royalty from half the world. Narrowly escaping arrest by the Neofascists, Isabelle dedicated her life to preserving the uppermost interests and image of the family.\n\n\n== Sursock Archives ==\nThe halls of the Sursock Palace contain the historical archives of the Sursock family empire. The archives, which are divided into three categories (public, private, and commercial-accounting), primarily span from the years 1876 to 1978 and record the activities of Alfred, Moussa, Nicolas, Princess Isabelle, Lady Cochrane and other particularly prominent members of this small Greek-Orthodox family.An extensive study on the archives and the family itself can be found in Lorenzo Trombetta's 'The Private Archive of the Sursocks (Sursuqs), A Beirut Family of Christian Notables: An Early Investigation.'\n\n\n== Land sales to the Rothschild Family and early Zionist settlement ==\n\nJezreel ValleyThe family owned more than 90,000 acres, or 400,000 dunams, (364 km\u00b2) in the Jezreel Valley in Palestine, having purchased it from Ottoman authorities in their dealings with the empire. Evidence of the remarkable concentration of wealth accumulated by the Sursocks, who already owned tens of thousands of acres of the finest land in the region, can be found in records detailing their sustained purchases of numerous new villages every year.In 1872, the Ottoman Government sold Marj ibn Amir  to the Sursock family of Beirut. The Zionists began to show interest in buying the Jezreel Valley in 1891, but the Palestine Land Development Company (PLDC), a Zionist land purchasing agency, made its first purchases in 1910. In 1897, Theodore Herzl writes about the Sursock family in his diary, noting the onset of negotiations with the Jewish Colonisation Organization for the purchase of 97 villages in Palestine.In ancient times Esdraelon was the granary, and regarded as the most fertile tract of Palestine. The Sursocks were absentee landlords in the vast Marj Ibn `Amer (Jezreel Valley) in Northern Palestine. The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1901 by funding from the Baron to buy and develop land in Ottoman Palestine for Jewish settlement. The PLDC acquired land for the Jewish National Fund (JNF). Official purchasing organizations such as the Palestine Land Development Company focused on consummating the transfer of some 65,000 dunams of land in the Jezreel Valley owned by the Sursocks. On 18 December 1918, the PDLC concluded an agreement with Nagib and Albert Sursock for the purchase of 71,356 dunams in the Jezreel Valley, including Tel Adashim. The Ottomans tried to limit mass land acquisition and immigration, but had their hands tied by European pressure and also corruption and greed of officials and large landowners. The sale of land in Marj ibn Amer is a noted case. Hankin of the KKL transacted the final settlement of purchase in 1921. Hankin originally worked for the PLDC and then became the main land speculator for both agencies. The buyers demanded the existing settlers be relocated and as a result, the Arab tenant farmers were evicted, with some receiving compensation the buyers were not required by law to pay. Because the villagers paid tithes to the Sursock family in Beirut for the right to work the agricultural lands in the villages, they were deemed tenant farmers by the British Mandate authorities in Palestine, and the right of the Sursock family to sell the land to the JNF was upheld by the authorities.\nEdmond de Rothschild began investing in Palestine at the age of 37, in 1882. In 1923, he founded the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association (PICA), which carried on his work under his son, James Armand de Rothschild (1878-1957). By 1930, PICA had amassed 5,200 hectares in various parts of the country, on which it established 50 settlements that reflected the diverse models that had evolved by this time: villages (such as Pardes Hanna, Binyamina and Givat Ada, all named for members of the Rothschild family), kibbutzim, moshavim and urban localities such as Bnei Brak and Herzliya. PICA continued to assist rural settlements as well as developing or financing economic enterprises of lasting importance in the Israeli economy \u2013 wineries, the Potash Company, the Electric Company and Nesher Cement, to name a few. By the end of the Mandate (1948), PICA possessed a large proportion of the Jewish-owned land in Palestine.In the next 17 years, the Baron spent $100 million in purchasing lands, building factories, schools and hospitals.  In 1912, the PLDC contracted to purchase a large tract in the Jezreel Valley from the Sursock family of Beirut and Alexandria, but was unable to complete the transaction due to World War I.In 1929, under the British Mandate, the Sursocks sold the valley to the Baron Rothschild. The European dynasty of German Jewish origin that established European banking and finance houses from the late eighteenth century had established a fund to buy land in Palestine and encourage the immigration of Jews to Palestine.The Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association \u2013 PICA- was founded in 1924 by Edmond to administer the settlements in Palestine and took over the role of the Jewish Colonisation Association of 1900. PICA was the largest Jewish landowner in Palestine. Edmond\u2019s involvement with Jewish settlements began in 1882 when he funded Rishon Le-Zion (\u2018The First in Zion\u2019) He established Zikhron Yaakov and Mazkeret Batya (named after his parents) and built  social and religious institutions there. Edmond also stimulated the economic development by investing in new crops, such as wine, grapefruit and avocado, and industrial enterprises such as silk production. After Edmond\u2019s death in 1934 his son James de Rothschild (1878-1957) presided over the affairs of PICA until in 1957, the year of his death, he decided to transfer all PICA holdings to national institutions. His determination to continue to support Israeli institutions was carried out after his death by his wife, Dorothy (1895-1988), who founded Yad Hanadiv. When Edmond died in Paris in 1934, he left a legacy which included the reclamation of nearly 500,000 dunams of land and almost 30 settlements.\nIn 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (JNF-KKL). Urgency for large colonization, quick purchase, and rapid self-sufficiency by means of general agriculture made the Jezreel Valley the focus of land purchasing plans. The Zionist Organization thought the Jezreel Valley to be more desirable than even the coastal region where smaller parcels of land were available for purchase. Buying parcels in the coastal region involved more complicated purchasing negotiations. The coastal region was also the center of orange cultivation, a type of agriculture that would not yield a profit for several years, thus potentially impeding the Labor Zionist idea of self reliant settlement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine, evidence to the Shaw Commission, 1930\n Media related to Sursock family at Wikimedia Commons",

          "What is now the Nicolas Sursock Museum was once a home to one of Beirut's richest and most affluent families. It is now home to hundreds of artworks from some of Lebanon's most famous painters and sculptors. Each floor represents a different era in Lebanon's modern history.",
          "A big residential building has been allowed on part of the land of the garden; thus the museum does not appear so magnificent as it is and it should. Partly shadowed, it looks now as overwhelmed and threatened by a nasty giant.",

          "I visited this museum somewhat on a whim due to the suggestion of my tour guide. Nicolas Sursock was a wealthy Lebanese aristocrat who bequeathed the building and a number of pieces of fine art to the city after his death; everything was renovated about a decade ago to the tune",
          "The exhibitions on the upper floors are wonderful. The design and general architecture of the building is superb. On the lower ground floors there are various installations which are some of the best I have ever visited. Treat yourself to this wonderful Museum",
          "This is a lovely save with art work curated by Nicolas Sursock from the 1950s until the civil war began. He arranged a sequence of traveling shows over the years that brought foreign collections in to Beirut and collected some wonderful lebanese art over the years leading up to",

It is known for its upscale apartment buildings, numerous restaurants, and cliff-side caf\u00e9s that line Avenue de Paris, which forms part of the Corniche Beirut.  The corniche or the wide, seaside sidewalk of Avenue de Paris is popular on weekends and evenings where strollers and joggers crowd the pavements.\nOff the coast of Raouch\u00e9, there is a natural landmark called the Pigeons' Rock (also known as the Rock of Raouch\u00e9). Located at Beirut's westernmost tip, the two huge rock formations, which stand like gigantic sentinels, are a popular destination for locals and visitors alike.Raouch\u00e9 also is claimed to be the remains of a sea monster the Greek hero Perseus killed to save Andromeda. The stone is rock as Perseus used Medusa\u2019s head on the monster to turn it into stone.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nSome historians believe that the word \"raouch\u00e9\" derives from the Aramaic word rosh or Arabic word ras, both meaning head.  Other historians argue that it is a corruption of the French word roche (rocher), meaning rock.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe shores near Raouch\u00e9 have yielded the area's oldest evidence of human existence, flints and basic stone tools, which are displayed in the AUB Archaeological Museum.\n\n\n== Present status ==\nThe area adjacent to Raouch\u00e9, called 'Dalieh', is presently in the process of being sold to real-estate developers. A campaign was started early 2014 against the privatization of Raouch\u00e9 and the adjacent area-called al-Dalieh-which was initially titled \"The last that remains\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeirut Central District\nAvenue de Paris\nRas Beirut\nBeirut\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Great sunset view, you can bus from Central Beirut, we bussed back and had dinner in downtown Beirut. It is a bit of a walk if you get off too early but it's pretty, and you get to see the sea.",
          "amazing place that you should really go and visit , try not to go during day in summer as it will be very hot",
          "A beautiful location at the cities edge in the aqua blue waters of the Mediterranean. Boats can be rented, swimmers, and diving! Or just sit with a coffee and enjoy the beauty.",
          "This natural rock is very nice to see but not an activity on it\u2019s own. My adivce, go have breakfast or dinner at Al Falamanki. The view from there is fantastic. My photos are from the restaurant.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you get the chance! Stunning view all day, but especially at sunset. I\u2019d recommend having a meal at one of the many restaurants that face directly towards Pigeon Rocks - lovely",
          "Beirut residents and tourists alike enjoy the magic of the sunsetting here. It is definitely an experience",
          "The pigeons are rocks in the sea that, together with the sunset, offer a magnificent exhibition for taking pictures. IT IS A LAST THING TO COME WALKING TO THEM, YOU SEE THE QUANTITY OF GARBAGE THROUGH THE SEA.",
          "The Pigeon Ricks are at Raouche along the Beirut corniche promenade. These rocks look stunning in the beautiful clear blue water. There are also several restaurants and cafes overlooking the rocks from the corniche cliff top. Well worth a work around the corniche to view these",
          "Worth to see this place , for me it was the most beautiful place at all Lebanon , stones , water and the view is amazing , I saw also that some party's they organized there , restaurants around have amazing view sure but not good service and as general menus at most Lebanese",
          "A couple of rock outcrops in the ocean surrounded by over priced bars. We sat at one of these bars for sunset drinks and it was nothing special, try a roof top bar in town instead",
          "Such a natural historical place to enjoy with a view from the top that its caf\u00e9s give you a lifetime opportunity to enjoy!",
          "Nice place to take some pictures. Try to take a boat tour as it's really better to take pictures from there, but always bargain the price",
          "You can\u2019t visit Beirut and not swing by the Pigeon grotto or Rock in Raouche. Avoid getting there in the afternoon/evening when it is very crowded and you can\u2019t find a place to park. You can take a boat trip from the fishermen\u2019s harbor to visit the rock. They will take you",
          "Love it. But parking is always difficult if you happen to have rented a car. Otherwise, have someone drop you off or take a taxi or walk. It's a pretty scenic area. Lots of tourists, lots of locals, so active day and night. Safe place but it doesn't hurt if you watched your",
          "Absolutely beautiful part of Beirut with stunning views of the Rock and the sunset but the area is ruined by the trash, I was disgusted with people just throwing their rubbish everywhere. Even with the amount of trash around I wouldn't or couldn't even think about throwing my",

          "You can take the Hop-on Hop-off Bus and it stops there. Why? Don't know. We stayed on the bus and did a drive by. That was enough for me.",
          "I always see this rocks in Arabic movies. But first time to see. Very nice scene there. You should have time to have a boat through it. Also the area Al Rouch is very beautiful.",
          "People gather along the Corniche across from Raouch\u00e9 Rocks to watch the sunset. Spectacular. We were lucky to have a great seat at Bay Rock cafe to watch sun go down. We ordered a 1/2 bottle of Ros\u00e9 wine and it was 2 for 1 so we got a full one. Perfect.",
          "I didn't really understand why so much fuss is made of these rocks. We walked for a long time to get there and were very disapppinted. Perhaps its becuase we didn't get the perfect sunset? Lots of pollution wherever you look.",
          "The view for the rocks is really great.We went to see the sunset & it was so lovely. There\u2019s lots of restaurants & bars around.",
          "The Raouche Pigeon Rocks in Beirut are as picturesque as advertised, especially if you climb down to the rocky coastal breakwater. From out on the coast you can see different horizon views, a different Beirut cityscape, sea caves, old boats, and even chickens.",
          "When you are walking along The Corniche (the main boulevard), the Pigeon Rocks are nice to visit as well. When walking, you probably will be asked if you want to visit them by boat. Depening on the price, that could be a good option, but the view from the coast is great, so no",
          "Nice area to take a walk by the sea. Have a cocktail or ice cream in one of the cafes or shisha and dinner.",
          "We were walking all over Beirut and decided to walk here one day to take in the views. We arrived took some pictures and that was it. There's not much to see besides the rocks but there's a Starbucks with the view and various other restaurants you can pass your time at.",
          "Lots of restaurants around the corniche w views of the pigeon rocks. A must see to be convinced that this busy, congested, lively, fascinating city IS really indeed Beirut!!",
          "Raouche Rocks a great place to visit by boat for tour, or you can just see it from far from the road",
          "You could start or end your walk along the Corniche here and it's a nice view of some natural rocks. It was interesting watching the little boat trips navigate their way through the rock when the water was choppy - I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed being on one of those boats! There",
          "Located in the south of the Corniche [some say south of the Corniche], these limestone rocks are very well known and make good photographic subjects, especially the one with the arch in it. They are part of the fabric of Beirut, requiring a brief, but necessary, visit.",
          "Best Photo place in Corniche. Beautiful walking way and nice view. Don't go back to your home before watching sunset in Pigeon Rocks",
          "The Raouch\u00e9 Rocks or also called Pigeon Rocks are a must see site along the Beirut Corniche or beach sidewalk beside Avenue de Paris.

          "The Pigeon Rocks are just amazing . Although I didn't visit the inside of the caves, the rocks were nice. The whole view around them was nice.",
          "It's a famous place to visit in Beirut however I really don't know why, you can add it to the list but don't expect much as it's only rocks and sea side corniche, it can be an evening plan for a walk but not to waste the whole day on it .",
          "Raouche is a very iconic place. It is one of the first things that come to mind when one thinks about Lebanon. It is beautiful no matter when you visit.",
          "Great place that I had the opportunity to admire from above when we were landing by the plane. Better go late in the afternoon and stay till the sunset which is wonderful.",

          "Nice place to chill and explore the close restaurants and bars. Highly suggested for sunset and sunrise.",
          "Another sight of Beirut that needs to be seen in person! Photos are beautiful, but seeing this landmark with your own eyes is something else.",
          "As far as rocks go, they are very nice, coming out of the sea, with a passage inside. Beirut doesn't have that many attractions anyway, apart from night clubs.",
          "After navigating the gigantic pileons of cement (still don't know what they are) and going down a foot path, it was hopskotching on the rocks. Next time I visit, I will bring a blanket and make a picnic out of the day.",
          "We stopped of here during a taxi ride round the town the view is spectacular we were lucky enough to see a boat speeding under the rock and round the area",

          "Every now and then I take my family for a promenade on the corniche of Beirut. Pigeons rocks is my favourite place especially at night. Nice view from the corniche!",

          "Awesome site, it looks like a view where you'd have to travel less for, but it is found literally on the edge of the city. Can't miss it if you're in Beirut!",
          "A beautiful boardwalk perfect for a family activity gives view to Raouche rocks. The view from the Starbucks is beautiful and uninstructed",
          "Worth seeing if in Beirut. Go to one of the restos located nearby stare at it with a coffee. Go early in the morning so the sun is behind you.",

          "Great sight to look at and especially in the sun! Nice walk along the coastal line and just enjoy the views.",
          "Beautiful to see the sea waves hit these rocks. I couldn't see any resemblance nor link with pigeons.",

          "We walked here on a sunny day and while it was a nice view, probably not worth the walk back through a housing estate was we picked our way back to Hamra. Plenty of small and larger eateries and small fun fair nearby which I assume is open at weekends and in season.",
          "We saw that Pigeon Rocks was recommended so we took a walk on the corniche, which was very nice, to see this site. There are a couple of cafes, including Starbucks, which have a nice view of the rocks. I wouldn't say this is a stunning, must see site but its a nice walk and a",

          "It\u2019s worth taking the time to admire this beautiful formation if you\u2019re in the city. It is walkable from the corniche, although admittedly mostly uphill. When I passed by I didn\u2019t get any advances to purchase boat tickets, possibly because I was on my own, but the view from the",

          "It's the most well-known landmark in Lebanon, it should be your No.1 To-do-list in Beirut, you can get a sea tour with a small boat, but you have to bargain with the boat owners to have a sea trip around Raouche rock with a reasonable price. You should also go all the way down",

          "Raouche is a great place to have and afternoon walk and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sea and the rocks. You can descent into the edge of the water where some boats take you for rides around the rock. The rock itself is inaccessible due to its structure and I think it is",

          "It\u2019s worth the walk up from the corniche as it truly is a nice view. There are some (illegal) cafes/restaurants along the way that aren\u2019t necessarily the nicest places for food or drinks - I\u2019d recommend walking down to the sand banks to get a closer view. As the sun sets behind",

          "As I've said before, I can't fathom the notion of throwing your trash over the railing where all can see. It just ruins the experience of viewing these sea stacks. Pitiful.",
          "The rocks themselves are rather small and a bit dirty but there are lots of restaurants overlooking them, so it\u2019s nice for a sundowner or an early dinner",
          "You cannot miss visiting the pigeon rocks. Though there is a limited area where one can take good pictures of the rocks due to the restaurants being built exactly obstructing the view, they are still very important to visit. I would suggest sunset hours or early morning for good",
          "I loved seeing this offshore rock couple, especially during sunset. Strolling on the Corniche seaside promenade, you'll pass the Pigeons' Rocks. By the way, if you happen to go scuba diving at a dive site in Beirut, the dive boat will likely take you inside the caves next to the",

          "A stunning set of rocks welcome you to the city of Beirut. Pigeons\u2019 Rock is located at Beirut\u2019s western-most tip, the two huge rock formations stand like gigantic sentinels to the city. Locals love to walk along the corniche at any time of day, but during sunset it is",
          "In the late afternoon, ideally on a weekend day, take a stroll along the Corniche - a seaside promenade where families and friends come to walk, socialize, hang on the rocks of the beach or watch the sunset. For sunset itself make your way to the Raouche, an incredible rock",
          "No entry fees u just watch the amazing rock from a fair distance and u can take a boat in the sea and have a tour around it! Try bay rock cafe restaurant and have a beautiful lunch facing the rock. A bit pricy resto but deserves the scenery",

          "A beautiful photographic location where the local authorities try to keep it maintained with beautiful lightening at night and outstanding view during sunrise. However, don't try to go there during Eid or any celebrations as the place will be over crowded and you won't have any",
          "A very nice rock formation perfect for photos, both in day time and at sun set. It's close to the city centre, so you can easily walk. However, it's a few meters above sea level, so a bus is recomended if you want to wear your high heels. Bars and restaurants are close by,",
          "A must see place. Has been standing in the see for ages and we hope to keep on - no mstter of polution. The place was full of plastiv bottles, debris etc. Somebody should keep it clean and teach people ptotect our nature. The rock is magnificent, a gate to the see and Phonetians",
          "On of the few sites that the Lebanese have managed to keep untampered and as God/nature made. The rocks are lit at night. Sunrise walk by them is heavenly. Some places have 24 hr coffee. I stopped and had one before and after my morning walk. A piece of my Lebanon once",
          "The rocks itself are impressive, but around it there is nothing really worth it to do more than just drive by.",
          "Beautiful place to see sunrise rise and sunset and good to incorporate in a walk on the Corniche. Also had some nice restaurants close by.",
          "The rock looks more beautiful at night with the lights and the music coming from it, nice place to what the sunset",
          "take a long walk on the Raouche marina, where you can enjoy the sea breathe and a nice sunset. some merchant sell coffee from their cart or corn knob and fava beans! (yum). the pigeon rocket is facing the marina at all time.",
          "This can be viewed from a seaside sidewalk. Our guide stopped let us out to take pictures and enjoy the famous rock formations. Easily for all to view and enjoy.",
          "I made the walk from Zeiytuna Bay and it started out great. Unfortunately when you get there you no longer have a sea view but some restaurants and shops then it becomes awkward. Just a small space to enjoy the view and seats are not available. There is a Starbucks across the",
          "We were lucky enough to have Pigeon Rocks for a view from our hotel in Beirut. The sea an ever changing colour as it washes around the bases. Locals and visitors congregate on the Corniche above the rocks at sunset and they are a must-photograph landmark. Don't miss sunset over",
          "Beatiful view from the top. You can easaly walk down the the hill by using the passage way to the left side of the rocks. From there you will be able to see the rocks from the other angle, also the city on top of the clifs. There are some cafes with amazing view of the rocks",
          "This is an iconic Beirut location and you can easily see why - beautiful rocks in a tranquil sea setting, complete with salty breeze. Visiting in the early evening is the perfect time.",
          "If you will go to beirut lebanon , you must visit this place , you will enjoy it very much , it is really very nice",
          "This is one of the infamous locations in Beirut It\u2019s very nice view, when I visit Beirut I have to stop even for few minutes Under the rock there is a sharks pool (it could be a myth) but I heard stories about it from locals Don\u2019t miss it",
          "Nice place with good potential if only the place will be cleaned from all the rubbish, plastic, etc... however since it was not so clean and accesible it was nice rest place and being it in europe or mediterean it would be crowded so this was positive. Some restaurants at cliff",
          "Nice view if you get a front-row seat in one of the few cafes overlooking the rocks. And the beachfront walk from AUB is nice too. But I liked the beachfront area around Zaitunay Bay better for walking and eating.",
          "You gotta see these beautiful rocks onto Meditarrean Sea. Also its so windy so you can breathe fresh air.",
          "Had a wonderful spot to watch the sun go down over these rocks at the Bay Caf\u00e9 - we got there around 430 and our timings was perfect - watch the boats blast around it and through it. Lots of activity and our view was amazing from the By Caf\u00e9. If we had time I would have loved to",
          "Together with my girlfriend, we were able to sit in the evening at the Restaurant near the rocks and admire the sunset. The Pigeon rocks soon became artificially lighted with majesty, so that all the corners could be seen. A show must be watching. Who was in Beirut and does not",
          "It is recommended for the end of a walking after HAMRA STR or for the beginning of walking in the coastal zone of Beirut ...about 4 km to Zaituna Bay (marina) !",
          "Pigeon Rocks is the ideal place to view the sunset over the Mediterranean or just to appreciate the natural beauty of the rocks. Bay Rock restaurant has indoor tables facing the rocks and is another great way to view the sunset while enjoying a meal. Boat rides are also",
          "LEBANON is so dear for me, specially Raoucheh Rocks! This time I had a tour with my family using a small boat, it was amazing! Even the water of the sea at this area is different.",
          "Very relaxing view; the Raouche adds to the beauty of the Cornice where you can walk and enjoy a coffee or a meal in one of the many restaurants overlooking this magnificent view especially at sunset.",
          "I think its overrated place. Just a rock in sea. No more.take a picture and run away. Nothing to do else",
          "So, if you really want to enjoy, go sit in one of the many restaurants and watch the sunset above the rocks. It is amazing.",
          "I would say that there are not so many interesting places in Beirut, everything is outside the city, therefore Pigeon rocks is one of the attraction that can be visited within the city. There are a couple of restaurants that have a nice view from a terrace. Soon they might build",
          "Great natural landmark in Hamra along the coast. Beautiful scenery and it looks better during sunset.",
          "The rocks are very average and the corniche is dirty and overcrowded. The place looks better in pictures. Not worth being visited.",
          "A place with nice views on specially formed rocks in the sea close to the shore Nice Caff\u00e8 and restaurants with gardens over the cliff with magnific view and feeling while having caf\u00e9, tea, wine or something to eat",
          "Its a nice view from the road and you can walk down the rocks to get a closer look, however there is no actual path so be very careful. There are a few restaurants that overlook it also but otherwise, a few large rocks close to the shore. Boats weren't operating when we went as",
          "Loved the view from above and under, i actually got the chance to get a boat ride with a small fee. and we went into caves and under the pigeon Rock. the view and sites were spectacular, can't compare to anything I've seen before. Its a must see.",
          "There still are some spaces where you can have a look at the rocks without having to eat or consume something. The best spots have been privatized. Wish the city authorities would defend public interests better for instance by making an effort to improve the trail going down to",
          "If you want to see where the locals hang out in the summer, walk along the corniche. You will see elders chatting away while the young jump into the sea from rocks and the children cycle on the pavement. Pigeon rock is located at the far end of the corniche and is such a",
          "If you are type of person who loves the sea views U have to go and visit this place There is a lot of cafes and restaurants at this area and most of them got the view of Pigeon Rocks I do recommend Petit cafe as it got a nice view for the rocks and the environment of the",
          "Loved it. I hired a limousine especially to drive me their just to take a picture with the rock and get back to the hotel. It's a must see",
          "this is a place you must visit at the sunset time, there are a lot of restaurants located by the sea where you can seat outside and enjoy the stunning view",
          "Iconic Pigeon Socks is must see tourist attraction when in Beirut. Beautiful view of the seaside on the promenade, nice for a walk.",
          "Best time to visit is at the sunset. Watch Out for people asking to take pictures. But you may want to have dinner and sheesha here.",
          "Nice place to sit around. Have a long sea side walk. Enjoy the Mediterranean from a little height. Nice eating joints around catering for all kinds of taste pallets.",
          "Don\u2019t think twice... just go there enjoy the place, you can also have a short boat ride that will go through the rocks. If the weather is good and not raining , you can go down to near place of the rocks and enjoy the view towards Al Rawshe. You must go there.",
          "This is the place that almost every one visiting Beirut has to stop and take a picture. Also, it\u2019s nice to walk in that area with a number of restaurants close",
          "The Pigeon rocks make for a beautiful souvenir picture. They have been hewn by the Ocean waves and are very picturesque. This year's a very famous landmark here in Beirut it is worth your time to visit it while you are here. Don't forget to go and walk around downtown in the",
          "I really recommend visiting Lebanon in February as the weather is so beautiful. You can walk down to the rocks for free and climb up top to have a great view. Don\u2019t take a stroller with you though as you have to climb. We climbed up with my 1 year old daughter and she enjoyed",
          "The best view in town of these rocks is from the Bay Rock Cafe. They have lovely views, good food and staff are pleasant. You can have a beer or a meal. Lebanese mezze is served and recommended.",
          "Of course if you go to Beirut you have to stop by and see Pigeon Rock. No real activities other than taking in the view. There was however a random guy offering to take us on a boat ride through the caves nearby for 20 bucks. Only drawback is the parking is horrendous.",
          "Whenever you visit Lebanon \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde7 stop by Raouche. The place is amazing you will understand how grateful our God is to let the natural make this beautiful Raouche as it is right now",
          "Stop there it is a must by the sea and the beautiful tour around the area overlooking the sea where there are restaurants and cafe where you can sit to admire in the day or in the night there beautiful faraglioni rocks",
          "it\u2019s very nice place , and its more than a thousands years and good panorama from all sides also the Cornish it is the main landmark of Beruit :)",
          "It is worth to see. Great view. Great picture. There are some restaurants pointing the rocks. The only thing was annoying: the begger women around.",
          "Perfect example of selective erosion/abrasion, only few minutes from the city center, beautiful shapes! Geomorphologists and nature lovers will like it a lot!",
          "Check the place out - it\u2019s very nice and significant since it\u2019s been their for thousands and thousands of years! Also check out the Nestl\u0113 cafe there next to Starbucks, it\u2019s a bit pricey but you\u2019ll get great coffee and very nice desserts",
          "The rocks and mediterinian sea is wonderfull. Especially if you visit there while sundown. Beatiful wiew with smoking sise (argile) or drink a cup of coffe.",
          "This landmark is iconic. As the sunsets, the magic begins. Worth visiting the during sunset and in the mornings if you want to take a boat ride.",
          "It is a landmark of Beruit. Therefore must visit it when you are in Beruit. There is very nice view. You can see it while walking on Cornish.",
          "The rocks are amazing. It seems that the sea worked for thousands of years to sculpture these rocks to give them as a gift to Beirut. A must see for lebanon visitors.",
          "One of the best area and a must see place in Beirut. This area is filled with so many restaurants and coffee shops. It is the longest sea shore in Lebanon. You can do some jogging on this area in addition to so many other activities.",
          "If you visit Beirut and you do not have a walk on Raouch\u00e9 corniche, you will miss seeing the famous Pigeon Rocks that deserve to take a photo of them.",
          "Breathtaking anytime of the day but at night the Raouche is the best. The view is best enjoyed with a arguile and drink in the Petit Cafe, we enjoyed every minute of it. The best view in Beirut! A must when in Beirut.",
          "But little bit dirty. At least you should go Just because it s one of the symbol of the Beirut You ll see lot of locals and when there is strong wind it s stunning and scary !",
          "Really nice place to watch the sunsets, while in Beirut. Very romantic and relaxing. Having a cup of coffee on the terrace of one of the nearby cafes or restaurants, to appreciate the view, is a great idea too.",
          "The view is really nice and the christmas tree is very nice also should try to place something on the pigeon rock in every event hapening",
          "Located in the sea , very attractive iconic symbol for Beirut , Must click photo there :) . The place full of sales people, they laterally can sell you any thing , advised to keep cool and avoid them to enjoy the site seeing",
          "Had dinner there and smoked Shisha .. Excellent service and nice food. Average cost $ 40 - $ 50 per person for dinner.",
          "great view \u2026walking on the corniche on the seaside , you will pass in front of raouche rocks where many cafes are set right on the corniche where you can sit and enjoy the marvelous view with a nice cup of tea or a water pipe if you wish \u2026 you can enjoy breakfast in the morning",
          "Best to visit during the day but it is really pretty at night. A favorite for locals brides like to have photos taken along the strip because of the rock",
          "Let's be honest: Beirut is not beautiful. The rocks on the western shore are one of the few picturesque spots, and it gets crowded of people waiting for the sunset - and several married couples taking wedding pictures. arguably the best sunset spot in a city that lacks public",
          "Didn't think much of these rocks. It's again a personal opinion. Some people may love it but I personally thought it they're just naturally shaped rocks nothing else. But atmosphere was nice around this.",
          "Take a walk on the Corniche early in the morning as the sun shines on this natural wonder, also known as Pigeon rocks. The Corniche is a long walkway along the coast which offers an interesting view of the Beirut seafront.",
          "Well, it's a rock, okay, two - but it's not very unique, you can find this all over the world. There're more interesting things to do and see than the rocks",
          "You can visit Beirut without seeing the iconic rock formation and taking a stroll along the Rouchet Corniche or sit outdoor at any of the cafes and restaurants along the road. The view is amazing but like everything else in Beirut the traffic jam could be disturbing. Overall",
          "nice for a quick stop, as it is one of the landmarks of Beirut. However you will live if you don't get to see it...",
          "This is one of the views that I like the most in Lebanon and has few restaurants there where you can enjoy of a beautiful view and excellent food",
          "While visiting Beirut we drove out to see these rocks. It was a sunny day and the rocks are interesting. We could see people taking boat tours through the hole in the largest formation. They are a nice view Unless you are going on a boat ride or stopping at a restaurant with a",
          "Nice walk fresh Air people from all around the world amazing view to the Mediterranean Sea eye catching Rock",
          "Our friends took us to see the \"rock.\" I never expected it to be this amazing. It was in the early evening. The boardwalk was packed with people and vendors. Beautiful and safe area. Don't miss it.",
          "Great view of the area with parking right at the site. Some touristy selling of trinkets etc but no overly bothersome. There are boat rides if you like and plenty of people fishing.",
          "Located in the heart of Ras Beirut and is a landmark that you should see. Walking in the Cornish which overlook it is very Nice.",
          "The gigantic rock formations -2 of them which are connected- located in the western part of Corniche can be visited by boat - however there is nothing much to see and we would say that this unique rock formations which are featured heavily in Tourist brochures is better seen",
          "The view is beautiful from there and it's free. From one side the beautiful ocean, from the other side the beautiful mountains and from behind the skyline of the city. When you are in Beirut, this is a must see.",
          "It's interesting to see a number of rocks standing in the sea just in front of you. Some of the rocks are located further in the sea than others so you can only get there by the boat (which are plenty of those waiting to take you on board). A few rocks are connected to the",
          "We got our taxi driver stopped to take Beirut's landmark : Pigeon Rocks. Also the drivers and locals never say the rocks' name as Pigeon. Raouche or something like that. Only 2-5 minutes enough to take a selfie with it. That's all.",
          "Although the place has a nice view from the top (cafes or avenue), I was really disappointed of how dirty and not mentained the rocks and area around are. Go there for sunset only and enjoy a drink in one of the tourist traps cafes with terrace. Nothing else to do.",
          "The Rocks are great but the best are all the coffee shops overlooking it. Best place to watch the sun set over the Mediterranean",
          "we were looking forward to see these rocks, but we were not nicely surprised by so many rubbish on the way to Rocks...... Streets in town were much cleaner. Take proper shoes, very steep slope.",
          "Been to Beirut a few times- these rocks always provide a soothing view in the pristine blue Mediterranean Sea. Something that stays there irrespective. An evening walk to this place is always very relaxing",
          "If you're near hear, why not stop by the pigeon rocks in Raouch\u00e9, and admire the stone formations eroded by the sea. If you're not near, I would say it's worth sitting stuck in Beirut traffic for :)",
          "A nice view of the sea from this location and also an excellent place to take a lot of photos. Make it part of you cornice walk.",
          "Great walk for sunset. Lots of people but not noisy or disruptive. Erosion at its best. Couple of pricey cafes overlooking the rocks but keep walking, you can see it for free. And buy a flower necklace of gardenias for lgb 1000.",
          "What is there to say about pigeon rock? This is a can't miss destination if you are in Beirut. It's like going to London and not seeing the tower bridge. I really look forward to seeing if I could charter a boat so we can see it up close next time we are in Lebanon. It is",
          "We can say that LA ROUCHE is the icon of the city in Beirut. A must stop for pictures there is the best option if you have free time at this amazing city, also is recommend it to drink something around the hundreds of coffees or restaurants with the views of this pigeon rock!!!",
          "This is one (if not the) landmark in Beirut. It's truly beautiful but with so many people trying to rip you off with overpriced boat trips the experience becomes less exciting. The are around it should also be cleaned up to live up to the expectations. There are a few nice",
          "A must-see for everyone visiting Beirut for the first time! Could be accessed for closer view from the corniche (main road) through, sadly, a quite dirty path! Boat tours are available too though not well organized (people would approach you and offer a boat tour)! Or you could",
          "While I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, I definitely think it's worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood. Go down to the rocks where you will find people offering boat rides and you can even cliff dive with the locals.",
          "They were nice to see and classic for photos, they are free to see. So I think it is nice to see while you are there.",
          "Visiting the pigeon rocks is a must for any visit to Lebanon. It is a picturesque landmark . Highly recommend it.",
          "I was little disappointed, as I did not find the rocks as impressive or spectacular as I imagined from the pictures. The best views would be from the many restaurants & cafes lining the view.",
          "this is a very famous site in Lebanon it is a must to see, you can see it even printed on the lebanese money bills, you may take a look of it from beirut cornishe for free, or by chosing to sit on a coffee shop that is over looking it or by taking a boat tour and go through it,",
          "Raouche (or pigeon rocks) is so beautiful! Every time I come to Lebanon I have to take a trip to Beirut just to see these beautiful rock formations that mimic those of Capri on the Amalfi Coast of Italy. Great photo opportunity, but also great place to walk and eat. There are",
          "It is a great place for an afternoon walk by the sea. The view is memorizing but only if its on ur way. Not worthy to make the trip to catch this view.",
          "Try catch a picture at sunset! Great views, if you have a little more time - stop at the restaurant for a drink or meal.",
          "This is a must when you visit Buirut. My only issue is that they have now planted shrubs along the walkway so your view of the Pigeon Rocks is limited to about 3 areas.",
          "Good to have a walk in and lots of shops and restaurants across from the beach. There was heaps of rubbish on the actual beach though and near the rocks.",
          "There's always a but. The rocks themselves and the coastline are beautiful and you can walk out onto the jutting portion to get a better look at the rocks. The walk is a bit tricky and down a rough path on the rocks, so some balance and care is needed but once you are down the",
          "Beautiful at day and at night one of my favorite places in Beirut, also you're higher up than expected when viewing form Al Falamanki or Le Petit Cafe restaurants. Great for reflection or just enjoying a nice bite to eat with a stunning view and plane spotting!",
          "I remember, when I was in Greece, I took a ferry to Santorini ISLAND because I read everywhere that I shouldn't miss the sunset of Oia village in Santorini! Everyone was looking at the horizon to see what s/he had read in either on the web or in the book. It was dark and people",
          "Nice views of the rocks. Go to the restaurant on top. Good food and nice views while having lunch or a cold drink.",
          "When you visit Beirut this is a pretty iconic spot to visit. Quite nice, very busy at all hours. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes along the cliffs nearby to get something to eat so worth a visit.",
          "its one of the most famous place in Lebanon to visit it its in sea front of Beirut , rawchee there is lot of restaurant there to sit and watch the sunrise",
          "too bad the corniche is not cleaned up at that spot. It could be so much nicer with a little bit of improvement.",
          "It's a mini version of 12 apostles of Australia...not as spectacular but a good sight. A dirty beach front spoilt the experience.",
          "Beautiful spot, viewed from the corniche or one of a small handful of cafes that line the corniche. If you could see it from a fishing boat, from the ocean, that would be better. Try not to look too closely or you will notice all the trash in the water and on the beach and on",
          "Though it's only a big rock in the sea, but this place is a must see when you reach beirut. Unfortunately the place is a little bit crowded and sometimes you can see weird people, but take a photo and i'm sure you'll put it on your profile. Why don't you arrange a little trip by",
          "We went there to have breakfast in one of the cafes overlooking the rocks; Petit Cafe. It was a very nice view. We saw however some boats in the sea where people swim nearby the rock and boats going through them. I bet this would be so cool.",
          "Any visit to Beirut is not complete without seeing Raouche. The best view is from Petite Cafe while having breakfast and then hiring a small boat to take you directly to the rocks and through them.",
          "Nice stroll along the shore ; Buildings are quite recent, we preferred getting back inside town to enjoy older constructions with character.",
          "Visit it by day or by night for a beautiful scenery. They also have trips by boat that takes you under the rock.",
          "You just can't visit Lebanon without having a look at this Rock in Raouchi. There is a place to walk for pedestrians and take photos . Sunset time to visit this location is best...you can have a bicycle ride too...",
          "good place where you can go to take photos and nothing else. there is nothing around. not even shop where you can buy water. in total you need 5 to 10 minutes here :)",
          "We did not travel to the rocks themselves, but we dined at a restaurant on the Corniche which overlooked the rocks. The view was stunning and there was a lovely aura of peace and tranquility as we looked out over the rocks. An unmissable photo opportunity when you're next in",
          "I highly recommend taking a walk over to pigeon rock at sunset, its gorgeous. The water below is so clear. Maybe plan to eat at one of the restaurants overlooking the Rock and have a lovely meal as the sun sets. So glad we went there.",
          "You can't visit Beirut without have seen this beautiful view. I even can't remember how often I visit the PigeonRocks... and this time I was lucky. And had a stunning beautiful sunset.",
          "I wouldn't say it's a must visit attraction, but it looks beautiful especially from a top of the tall building. My hotel was just opposite, the room had a view to the rocks - it was stunning!",
          "I really enjoyed walking down towards the rocks to get a good view. There are several exotic looking rocks and inundation on the seashore from the waves. Very beautiful. You can also take photos from the road above.",
          "Nice area, full of restaurants, with amazing views of the sea, very well known for all visitors as one of the main sightseeing .",
          "Visited in 2010 and heard sad stories about suicides in this place. But now is for sightseeing. But it's a nice place",
          "Seems like every tour guide wants you to see Pigeon Rocks - which is fine but there is not really a lot to see - lots of hustlers trying to sell boat rides there - it is ok",
          "Situated in a not very accesible area. maybe by boat, but we were only able to view from afar. Located in the buzy Roauche area. Many great restaurants nearby",
          "If you are visiting Lebanon for the first time, this is a must. It represents Lebanon. So beautiful during sunset",
          "This is by the Beirut seafront and its pretty - worth stopping by for a photo opp. What was more interesting was the fact that the new apartments in this area cost upwards of $20m a floor, or so our tour guide informed us. Place has a nice vibe, many places to grab a coffee or",
          "It is nice place to go to. The sunset there is very nice. I think the good about this place is cafes where you can enjoy coffee there.",
          "You should visit this place for sunset. Incredible view. Having breeze in your face with iodine smell. You can have a coffee and nargile in Bay Rock Cafe",
          "one of the best place during the travel you can consider to take hands of your partners .find a place near sea with shadows take some rest and enjoy a nice view.also you can take a boat and drink some tea there . one of the negative point of this place that is necessary to",
          "A must stop on your trip to Beirut. A national symbol. So make sure you stop by. Boats are available for rent that will take you thru the hole and around the rocks. Plenty of nice restaurants to catch lunch.",
          "Overall, if you're in the area it's worth a visit but not necessary to go out of your way for. You can walk down onto the rocks, however it's a rough path with steep stairs, sand & rocks (no proper walkway). If you're up for a bit of adventure & a hike, it's a fun detour.",
          "We stepped into the Bay Rock Cafe and were already pretty impressed by the views of the rock until we looked over the edge and saw possibly the most polluted natural landmark I have ever encountered and I've seen a few! The water around the rock has thousands of plastic bags,",
          "Nice local place visited by lots of tourists as it is emblematic to the country. It's sad that there is no maintenance and grass covers the view.",
          "Its a beautifull place for relax and beautiful nature decorated by god hands if u visit beirut if u should visit the place",
          "I spent 4 hours around the rock with a very interesting sea view, endless limits with fresh air and a sea trip inside the rock full of wonderful caves. You have many restaurants and cafes looking directly to the rock, you can spend time have lunch, drink usual tea and enjoy",
          "Very lovely part of Beirut, if you visit Beirut you should definitely come here You can do a boat trip too, but we didn't bother, instead we just walked down and took some photos",
          "It's not a place you would make an event out of. You wouldn't say 'I can't wait to go to Pigeon Rocks!!!' It's not Ayers Rock or the Grand Canyon but I would go there to 'chill' (although the weather will probably be hot - what a contradiction). Go there for a nice relaxing",
          "I've been there while the weather was cool, the cornish is a nice walk all along with nice restaurants on the other side. You can even take a boat ride and go through the rock if you would like. Great people there.",
          "It is really a charming place to visit. We always see it in TV but being there is different. Try to enjoy it from the cafe and enjoy a drink or a meal. You will not regret it. Then you can walk along the beach to see the rock from different angles. You can also go down a small",
          "We used to visit this restaurant several times every year, each time we enjoy the unique view, the great food and the professional service, every time we enjoy our visit, I recommend it.",
          "the sea was heaving when we were there and the power is spectacular. we had a ver nice meat at the Bay Rock restaurant, directly overlooking the sea,",
          "Goog place to watch sea eating something. But there is no special thing. In my opinion, you go to Pigeon Rock without small expectation. Then you will be satisfied.",
          "Located at the western edge of the Corniche, these geological structures are evidently left over from an earthquake in the distant past; they are on everyone\u2019s short list of things to check off even if you\u2019re just passing through town. I made numerous trips here during my nine",
          "Worth seeing , you may sit on Rock bay cafe have a gr8 meal watching the Raosha Rock then go have a tour in the boat , we visited 4 caves had amazing photos , there is another longer trip , but we didn't have time cos we had to leave to the airport , the trip we took is abt 20",
          "An excellent view and a must see along your journey in Lebanon. The view on question is scenic and is immeasurable come sunset",
          "It's such a BEAUTIFUL place. A definite must see. However, sadly, there is way too much litter around. Plastic bags, bottles and all sorts of trash is scattered all over the area.",
          "Well worth a visit but was sorry to see so much garbage littering the area. The Lebanese flag might need to be replaced soon too, that one is faded and torn.",
          "Especially during sun set the view is excellent. I believe you can a take a boat tour around the rocks. Even if you cannot, still enjoy the view and the magic sun set.",
          "Interesting to see such a vibrant local atmosphere; dancing swimming and picnicking, but a shame that so much rubbish is left and that there's clearly no effort made by the state to keep it clean. This is clearly a place where local families come to spend the day and didn't",
          "Been here in Lebanon many years and used to come during weekdays while send kids to school in ACS, peaceful and great deep blue mediterranean sea view, few joggers and randomly street food vendors passing by, a wonderful picture. did a yaght trip go throw the rocks which was",
          "Raouche is a stretch of coastline along a cliff commanding views of the sea and especially Pigeon Rock, which is an iconic and a Lebanese national symbol. All along the walk are restaurants taking in the good views. I would recommend having a coffee or light snack as the food",

          "Some native guys ask us for shipping we accepted that and it was great we went at the hole in the rock token some pics and enjoyed it",
          "The area is old, many beggars asking for money. The area is known for some famous traditional sweet shops like \"halaab\". The view of the rocks is breathtaking. Some ppl will offer you sea trips through the rock, but they are overpriced.",
          "The location was very close to our hotel (Lancaster Plaza) so we had chance to visit it several times. It seems it was possible to rent a boat but we preferred to limit our visit to some photo shooting. People say it's love rocks (and I think it is).",
          "One of the main attraction in Beirut. Nice place by the Marina for walking and enjoying the view. You won't be disappointed",
          "Naturally it is amazing, but unfortunately this beauty doesn\u2019t deserve the garbage around. A very nice place to watch the sunset over the Mediterranean Sea and here the sounds of the waves. I recommend walking down to the beach in spring time especially after this location.",
          "It is a nice view from the street.we have managed to visit this place often with a boat. It is really fascinating to drive near the huge rocks or to drive thru it with a jet ski.it is incomparable and worth to try.",
          "We took my parents here when they visited from the US. I'm glad we did it, to say we did & get the pictures, but it wasn't anything 'special' in the way it is done. You just jump in a boat, take the picture and return. It would be nice if it was an actual 'experience'. But, it",
          "Beirut in general used to be less crowded and more clean streets, it still a very nice place to visit, but requires more care. The place around the rock is safe with nice people.",
          "This is a very nice location for a Snap or Selfie. A giant rock with a giant gate inside - always worth a visit.",
          "We saw it at night time .However ,still a very nice view ,places around it sold overpriced water and coffee .",
          "Visible from the Cornice, Pigeon Rock is even more beautiful if you climb down the narrow, rocky trail.Plus you get a good view of the Cornice from down there",
          "This areas has a number of restaurants overlooking the rock where you can sit right on the the seafront and admire the nice views.",
          "If you are in Lebanon, this is a Must See and if you have a further chance to take a boat to pass through the rock - that's even more amazing... you can't leave Beirut without pausing for a photo with this Rock in the background. You can also enjoy the view by staying in a cafe",
          "Good and safe place for walking, eating and enjoying the nitght life of Beirut. One the best sunsent ever..with the Mediterranean sea.",
          "Rouche is super cool. Reminded me of capri. Its good for a quick picture during sunset. Nice for running on the side walk aswell",
          "What a wonderful walk all along the corniche to end up at this wondrous spot...with an abundance of viewpoints and cafes, the rocks and vista themselves are outstanding",

          "Standing in the middle of sea like a huge castle...this site has been a huge and an impressive symbole in Beirut dating back to several decades. While ur in Beirut u cannot but stop at this site contemplate its majesty and take a couple of selfies!!!",
          "Just cannot believe the rave reviews about this place ! We walked all around the Corniche to find these, with high hopes and these were the most underwhelming thing I saw in Beirut. The rocks are nice, but the area is not and the scramble down to the rocks is full of broken",
          "This one of Lebanese history in Beirut , super view to seeing the sea and watching this Rock in , I come every week",
          "Much ado about nothing. Some rock, not even that big. One had a hole a boat can travel through. We were among many looking, however. Keep moving ahead.",
          "It's a great long walk from Corniche down to here. Highly recommended to take the time to do it and enjoy the view.",
          "nice attraction and one of the most famous spots in lebanon,deserves a visit to see it closely by a boat",
          "Worth seeing especially if you want to take a stroll to the end of the corniche. Not much else nearby, but worth seeing on a sunny day.",
          "You need few minutes to take some nice pictures. That area of corniche is not the best or the cleaner one.",
          "This place has so much potential!!! We crawled down to get a better vantage point and it was really pretty, like formations you see in travel magazines, it's too bad that on the way down we encountered SO MUCH TRASH! It was quite a pity that it isn't better maintained with",
          "The pigeon rocks in Raouche are a huge tourist attraction in Beirut. They offer ana amazing backdrop for photos. It's great to capture sunset at the rocks. You can take boat rides and go right next to the rocks and underneath them.",

          "It is a simple place but it is very attractive to visit with good camera shoots. But it needs some care and improvements",
          "So far the best place i have seen yet is the pigeon rock, restaurant around are quite nice and lovely staff ,Well if locals stop littering around that would be best place in Lebanon..all in all its a good place",
          "It\u00b4s a famous sight in Beirut. Before my visit, I checked for many times in the post cards and Lebaneses Restaurants in Europe. Good for pictures, but I recommend to include in your city tour, and do not go to this place only.",
          "It is a very beautiful place. Naturally created and have been there for so long that it's considered one of the landmarks of Lebanon. When you see the pigeon rocks you know this is Beirut. Plus it's a very beautiful sight to see from the airplane before landing. I love the",
          "It is a nice place to see. It shows what nature is capable of doing. Don't expect to much, what you see on the pictures is what you will see in real life.",
          "Just a rock. It is very famous and people are taking photos with it in the background. However, nothing impressive.",
          "I really was shocked with all garbage lying around. Though I only would blame the people visiting that place. For example, a high class restaurant facing the rock where people can sit and enjoy dining at the edge of the cliff. I could see people throwing napkins and empty",
          "It was a lovely sunny day , we walked from our hotel in hamra to this location with google maps ! A long walk but one to remember , these rocks are bang in the beginning of the sea but are beautiful and you can also take boat trip under it or you could chill and have dinner wand",
          "My friends and I walked along the promenade from downtown Beirut for what seemed to be a life time! We got to the rocks in Raouche at around 4pm and sat in one of the cafes enjoying a coffee before the sun went down. This was by far my favourite part of our trip. It was",
          "I live in Beirut so I see the Pigeon Rocks on a daily basis in my commute and I got used to their splendor. If you're visiting Beirut for the first time, they're a must see. I particularly like them at sunrise and sunset. You can take a small boat tour and pass under the rocks.",
          "Just an average corniche walk. Nothing too famous. Although real-estate is very expensive there, and the surrounding hotels, and some of the caf\u00e9s are nice.",
          "I traveled to Beirut a while back, probably in 2012 and I feel obliged to write this review because I enjoyed my time there despite the tight schedule. I had work all day long and took advantage of my free time before 9 to see Beirut. I rented a bike and cycled along the coast",
          "This famous Lebanese landmark is well worth the effort to see. Sitting in a small inlet these two rocks are picture perfect and are rather impressive. The viewing area is well maintained and offers a number of opportunities for some great photos. There is also a number of eating",
          "Raouche area in Beirut is famous for its Pigeon Rocks. The view is fantastic and renders peace of mind. If you feel like a walk this is the place to be. It is enjoyable to walk by amongst many or to sit at the banks available for all pedestrians facing the sea. Cafes and",

          "I lived across the street from Pigeon Rock in the late 50's. I don't know if this is true today ... but at least once a month someone would commit suicide by jumping. I also remember boy scout troops camping on top of the larger of the 2 rocks. The apartment where we lived is no",
          "What a nice view i just see , it is a very mandatory place to visit in lebanon If you didn't see it during your visit to lebanon , you won't considered as a lebanon visitor Everything was great and almost perfect during my visit to this place except one thing \" The uncounted",

          "This is a nice place to hang out and to see. Walking along the cornice and you come to this place. At sunset it looks really nice and it is one of those things that are nice to see.",
          "A nice scenery where you may take a nice photo to post on your favorite social media platform, but it is just a weird rock in the sea. I would not define it as WOW! However, with good weather the numerous cafes looking the rocks should be pretty busy and the entire area should",
          "Perhaps with a boat to cross the hole of the rock will be exciting, but from the corniche, it is only a typical view.",
          "the pigeon rocks should be visited at sunset. there are many caf\u00e9 shops were you can enjoy the view on their terraces.",
          "its a must to see, the rocks are just beautiful with the waves hitting it and a background of the sea. They are some coffeeshops there serving shisha where you can enjoy the great view",
          "The rocks were pretty cool looking, but I didn't consider them a must-see in Beirut. They were pretty easy to see but we only stayed for a few minutes.",
          "A truly amazing natural sight. You can either see these rocks from the street above, which allows you to see both rocks well. Or there is a small trail that leads down in which you can get a nice panorama view of one of the rocks and the Beirut skyline. Two words of caution:",
          "Weird geological phenomenon of rocks and very clear water. Amazing view. Top attraction in Beirut, a must see",
          "We stayed opposite pigeon rocks. We only viewed them from our hotel but believe you can get a boat tour to the rocks and around the caves. It was too cold and windy for us to do that whilst we were there but would have liked to.",
          "Food was tasty - on the balcony opposite the rocks. Lovely evening. Staff very friendly and helpful.",
          "Definitely worth the visit, having been told about the pigeon rocks it was top of my lis of things to see in Beirut.",
          "I went to the cafe which overlooks the rocks and I was in awe... they are even more impressive in person. Must see! Very peaceful to sit and eat and smoke hookah while looking out at this sight.",
          "We had breakfast at Petit Cafe which has direct views of the rocks. It makes for great pictures of Lebanon.",

          "These rocks were beautiful and very easy to get to. They are just right off of the Corniche- which was also nice, safe and picturesque by the way! This can be a quick stop, but it really was beautiful- especially at sunset!",
          "I guess you would have to be born and raised a Beiruti to fully appreciate these rocks, today mostly known for a place love-hungry couples could visit, and previously for a favorite venue for people wanting to jump to their deaths. Also, the only rocks the construction company",
          "It is a land mark that every one must see. One of the greatest location u can take a selfie at. I didn't give it a full mark because I think the city can do a little better job. For starters the city can allow more street vendors since this site sits on a great scenery",
          "A Lebanese must see icon. The beauty of the rock with the sea varies depending on the time of the day and the month. After enjoying the Pigeon Rock's views, walk across the street to the local Starbucks and enjoy a cup of coffee while you watch the rock and the masses of people",
          "A Must-see if visiting Beirut. Rock formations are incredible. There is a passage to climb down to the sea level, which opens an opposite view towards city buildings. I would recommend visit before sunset, around 5PM.",
          "Nice place with nice view People walking by selling coffe and nuts. And the nice nice restaurant's right in front of the rocks",
          "Guess you have to visit here even if it's for a short time. Better in the evening at sunset but anytime is fine. Nice place for a leisurely walk if the time is at hand",
          "What should be one of the scenic highlights of the coast road in Beirut has the shine taken off it by the mass of garbage smothering the cliff face and sea surrounding the rocks. Littering seems to be a Lebanese pastime, and it's very sad to see. Still a nice place for a walk,",
          "Don't miss the Pigeon Rocks while in Beirut. At least take a quick look from the corniche, and if you have time, linger at one of the restaurants to the north of the rocks to enjoy the view, especially nice at sunset. You can walk down to water level on a path south of the",
          "Very beautiful view of a natural sight seeing. The area surrounded by multiple cafes and restaurants offering a variety of styles. Very good spot for taking pictures unique for Beirut.",
          "The rocks emerged from the sea. Beautiful sight. Sea waves splashing the rock is so nice to see. Wind blows most of the time and making Flag on the Rock, dance.",
          "It was worth the walk in the hot mid day sun.... Took me around half an hour from Hamra by foot. Apart from feeling like I was melting in the sun, the view was beautiful! A lot of Cafes near by to enjoy a drink or something to eat while you enjoy the view also. Another bonus is",
          "Love the area, u can get anything nearby. The ice cream, food , seafood or local food. It's nice when u go before sunset. Stayin at Elite Duroy hotel which u could just walk to this area. It's nearby. The area most of it is very convenient. It's my 1st time but local people are",

          "Don't miss it if you are in Beirut. One of the beauty of nature. We went by a boat and also viewed it from the corniche. We also watched it from a restaurant during the sunset. It is simly beautiful and a must see in Beirut.",
          "Most of the landscape occupied by restaurants! Like many other public places in Beirut it is grimy and dirty Parking is another problem...",
          "Good visit during sunset. I recommend grabbing a drink, bite to eat at the many restaurants overlooking the rocks.",
          "A large big natural tock in the middle of the sea u must see while you visit beirut The name of the region is named after the name of the rock Raouche",
          "Great location on Cornish with amazing sea views and sunsets behind Roche Rock. Few good food venues",
          "Its possible to come from Hamra street, because it goes down the hill. Sunset is great where, also possible to take boat trip to go trough the hill",
          "Very Good place to walk away from downtown traffic only but not that much good rocks,the corniche is the best thing there only .",
          "For the best pics visit Rotana Arjane rooftop and take some of the most breathtaking photos of the rocks",
          "You can't actually go to Pigeon rock, but you can enjoy the view from the Corniche or one of the neighboring Cafes. It's beautiful and I bet the view is even better from the top of the rock!",

          "You can enjoy the pigeon rocks view from several cafes nearby and have tour breakfast or brunch. Also tou can go for a run in the early morning and enjoy the sea breeze. In the afternoon u can sit for a shisha either u bring it or at a cafe with a kaake or have a corn cob.",
          "If rocks are your thing then Pigeon Rocks are for you! A brief stop off during a tour of Beirut (near the Corniche). Gorgeous day so views out to sea were amazing.",

          "It's a nice mountain but very simple. Basically in 5 min you will finish taking photos, maybe it's better to do a boat trip around but we didn't try it..",
          "Nice place to hangout with friends, enjoy dreaming watching the sea, you can sit in one of the nice restaurants around taste a hookah, taste a kaake, or have a ride on a bike",
          "The Best thing you can do is to hire a small motor boat that takes you down inside the pigeon rock for only 25K lira .(do not pay more ) However this small boats lack all safety precautions , they do not offer life jackets to the passengers which is unsafe especially if you",
          "with a view of the harbour and this beautiful contribution from nature it really is amazing and even went under it with boat !",

          "It's one of the places to visit in Beirut. Nice view of the sea and the rocks. But the embankment is quite dirty. Looks untidy and poor hygiene, though it's good for walking. It's a shame that the people can't keep such a nice place in a better condition. \ud83d\ude23",
          "The rocks in themselves are great and watching the boat Cruise in between seems to be a thriller.. Quite a good spot to go In the morning alone the corniche.. Poor management and lack of vision has the place running down..the access road to it is not pretty clean and thrash",
          "This is primarily a photo-op and a chance to enjoy one of the best sea views in the city. Also a chance to take in some fresh sea air.",
          "its kinda just a big photo opportunity, there are also lots of restaurants and cafes that obstruct the view. Many kids also begging for money right by the motorway which is quite sad.",
          "Good cafes over looking the rocks. Far too much rubbish around the area and in the sea. One of the few places we visited that felt in need of some attention",

          "I went here with my parents. We walked around and it was very nice. We even took a boat ride. The only thing you need to be careful of is that there are a lot of refugees around and some may follow you. They aren't dangerous but hold onto your bags and mindful.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Grand Serail (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u200e, al-Sar\u0101y al-Kabir; French: Le Grand Serail; also known as the Government Palace) is the headquarters of the Prime Minister of Lebanon. It is situated atop a hill in downtown Beirut a few blocks away from the Lebanese Parliament building.\nThe Grand Serail is a historic building, the most important of three Ottoman monuments on the Serail hill. The other two are the Council for Development and Reconstruction and the Hamidiyyeh clock tower.\nThis historic building has earned its importance through successive roles which it held since 1832\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Barracks ===\n\nAfter its short-lived victory over the Ottomans in 1831, an Egyptian military contingent took position and set up its barracks on the western side of a hill overlooking Beirut and outside its walls. Ibrahim Pasha selected this hill for military reasons. It was a high hill overlooking Suq-al Munajjidin (the weavers' bazaar), this Suq, known today as the banks street (shari' al Massarif), was located on a strategic area within downtown Beirut, and close to Tal'at al American (American Hill), near Bab Yaacub (Jacob's Gate). In his book \"Taqwim al Ikbal\" Sheik Abdel Basit al Unsi describes that hill as being well situated, west of the city, away from the population and overseeing the sea and Beirut. Thus because of its situation, it allows the contingent to control the city and its suburbs.\nWhile the Egyptians were on that hill, the people customarily referred to it as the \"Al Thakanat\" (the barracks) because it was the lodging place that was selected by Ibrahim Pasha for his troops.\n\n\n=== The Garrison ===\n\nIn 1840, the Ottoman Empire with the support of the Prussian, Russian, and English navies, recaptured authority over Syria. The Ottoman military authority took interest in the hill overlooking Beirut and set up a military base there. The building was first used as the headquarters of military and civilian departments and then, after its expansion, it turned into the headquarters of Ottoman governors. Beirutis referred to it then as al Quishleh (modern Turkish: K\u0131\u015fla), a Turkish word for \"Garrison\" or \"soldiers quarter\". Construction and fortification of the barracks was started in 1853 and was further expanded during the Crimean war. Until 1856 the Grand Serail only consisted of a single floor, another floor was added and the ground floor then served as the cavalry stables. Between 1877 and 1894 major structural modifications were made which gave the Serail its final form.\n\n\n=== The Hospital and the Courthouse ===\nSultan Abd\u00fclaziz (ruled 1861\u20131876) ordered the building of a hospital (Hastahane in Turkish, usually shortened to Hastane in current modern Turkish), which was built in 1865, people referred to it as the military infirmary. The hospital building included two wings. Its northern wing housed a drugstore (ajzah). When the French entered the city in 1918, they turned the hospital into a courthouse. Later the courthouse was moved to another location and the building became the Institute of Fine Art of the Lebanese University.\nhowever the war that raged through Beirut destroyed most parts of the courthouse and turned them into ruins until prime minister Rafik Hariri donated the sum needed for its reconstruction and renovation. Since its inauguration in 1992, the building serves as the headquarters of the Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction.\n\n\n=== The Hamidiyyeh Clock Tower ===\nIn 1897, a clock tower was built near the Grand Serail to celebrate the anniversary of Sultan Abdul Hamid II's coronation and to make up for the absence of a public clock indicating mandatory Muslim prayer times especially that many foreign institutions had built western style clock towers. The construction of the clock tower was approved by the Sultan following a letter of supplication from Beirut's governor Rashid Bey. The ceremonial laying of the first stone took place on 9 January 1897 (the birthday of the Sultan) in the presence of high officials, military representatives and members of the municipality of Beirut.\n\n\n=== The High Commission ===\nIn 1918 after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World war one, the Flag of the Arab Revolt was briefly hoisted over the Grand Serail until the arrival of the allied forces who entered Lebanon by land and from the sea and occupied Beirut and the entire Lebanese coast on 8 October 1918. French colonel Depiepape was appointed by the commander of the allied forces General Allenby, he took control of the grand Serail and became the military governor of the country. With the removal of the Flag of the Arab Revolt, the Grand Serail was turned into the headquarters of the French Governor, who was granted the title of high commissioner of the French Government in the Levant. From then on the Grand Serail was referred to as the High Commission. In 1926 the French introduced changes to the northern facade of the Grand Serail. Thus a lobed arch balcony above the decorated entrance replaced the northern arched gate, which was moved to the southern entrance. The new balcony became a loggia for high commissioners and prime ministers' speeches. The French also removed a crown from over the arch of the northern entrance because it contained an engraved marble tablet showing the symbol of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n=== The Presidential Headquarters ===\nSheik Bechara El Khoury, who was the first post-independence President of Lebanon, holding office from 21 September 1943 to 18 September 1952, turned the Serail into the presidential headquarters before moving it to the Qantari Palace in Beirut.\n\n\n=== The Prime Minister's Headquarters ===\nThe Grand Serail became the headquarters of the Lebanese prime minister Riad as-Solh who was the first Prime Minister of Lebanon (1943\u20131945), after the country's independence and has been used as the Office of the president of the council of ministers headquarters ever since.\n\n\n== Architecture and Renovation ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Grand Serail ===\n\nThe Grand Serail followed the architectural design epitomizing the new Ottoman military organization known as the  \"New Order\" (ni\u1e93\u0101m ced\u012bd). Its elevated location and austere fa\u00e7ade copied the Selimiye Barracks in Istanbul. The finished structure consisted of two tall floors with the longer fa\u00e7ade spreading over 80 metres (260 ft). The eastern fa\u00e7ade is adorned by an arcaded protruding portico flanked by two symmetrical wings each divided by three rows of 16 windows. The monumentality of the building was further emphasized in 1861 when the military hospital was constructed.\nParticularly hit during the civil war, the Serail was a scarred site at the end of the hostilities. Its renovation to its present state of grandeur is a symbol of the vision and challenge involved in the BCD reconstruction. Restoration was completed in 900 work days in 1998.\nToday, the Grand Serail is a blend of heritage architecture with a modern interior and high-tech amenities. A faithful adaptation of the original Ottoman structure resulted in a larger, more functional building. The external walls were completely restored and stone from demolished buildings was used in the additional floor, thereby preserving a homogeneous facade. All contracting and handicrafts, including stone, marble, steel or carpentry works, were carried out by Lebanese firms.\nThe Serail covers 39,700 sq. m of floor space. The Grand Serail's four wings are disposed around a large courtyard which flanked at the center by a limestone and Carrera marble fountain. Both the exterior and interior facades are covered by a total of 588 arches and arcades (282 lobes arches, 197 pointed arches, 6 rounded arches, 11 mandolin arches, 92 pointed arcades). The north gate is constitutes the central structural element of the four facades. It is 11 metres (36 ft) high and 7 metres (23 ft) in width and was inspired by the Beiteddine Palace's gates. In the middle of entrance's arch a marble tablet was inscribed under the request of prime minister Rafik Hariri which reads: \"\u0644\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0644\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u062a\u0635\u0644\u062a \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643 \" which vaguely translates:\"If _political_ rule lasts perpetually for anyone, it would not have reached you\". The two upper floors comprise the Prime Minister's residence and office, offices for his staff, as well as the cabinet room and ministers' offices. The ground floor consists of a banquet hall, two receptions areas, a press room and a courtyard. Finally, an underground level includes a car-park, offices and rooms for the personnel. In all the Grand Serail includes 430 rooms and chambers in addition to the quarters for the maintenance and other service rooms.\n\n\n=== The Hamidiyyeh Clock Tower ===\nThe Hamidiyyah Clock Tower was designed by Youssef Aftimus, and restored in 1994 to its original condition. The Clock Tower stands 25 metres (82 ft) tall, it was the tallest structure in Beirut at the time of its completion. It was built of Beiruti sandstone, Jounieh limestone, Damascene Basalt and Deir el Qamar red stone. The clock tower's 300 kg bell, suspended on the third floor was accessible by a set of 125 cast iron steps inside the tower's 4 by 4 metres (13 ft) shaft. This floor has four miniature neo-orientalist style balconies topped by the four large French made clock faces which were especially imported by the Ottoman embassy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchitecture of Lebanon\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nlebanonpanorama\nLebanon.com the quarterly\nSolidere\nPCM.GOV.LB\n[1]",

In the 1950s the square became a popular venue for cinemas and coffee-houses. During the Lebanese Civil War, it formed the demarcation line that divided the city in half.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nInitially name \"Sahat al-Burj\", the Municipality of Beirut modernized the square in 1878 as the main meeting place of the city. Beshara Effendi designed a garden with fountain and kiosks, overlooked by the Petit Serail - the seat of Beirut\u2019s governor general \u2013 as well as public buildings and souks. After that, the square underwent a lot of transformations until 1931, where it took the name of Martyrs' Square in commemoration of the martyrs executed  there under Ottoman rule and a monument was erected.  In 1950, the Petit Serail was demolished. The new Rivoli cinema blocked the link between the square and the harbor. Martyrs\u2019 Square became Beirut\u2019s bus and taxi terminus and a popular venue for cinemas, coffee-houses, modest hotels and the red-light district. During the Civil War (1975-1990), Martyrs\u2019 Square formed the demarcation line that divided the city in half. In 2005, an international competition was launched for the design of a new square with its axis open to the sea, reestablishing Martyrs\u2019 Square as Beirut\u2019s premier public space and heart of the capital.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMartyrs\u2019 Square originated as an open space (maydan) beyond the city wall. The ancient watchtower of Burj al-Kashef marked its outer limit, and gave the square its first and still surviving name, Sahat al-Burj (Tower Square). \nIn 1773, a Russian cannon placed near the Burj caused the square\u2019s name to be changed to \u2018Place du Canon\u2019 (Cannon Square). It became \u2018Place des Canons\u2019 (Cannons Square) in 1860, when the initial Russian cannon was replaced by cannons from the French fleet. Named \u2018Hamidiyyeh Square\u2019 in 1884 to honor Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it became \u2018Union Square\u2019 and then \u2018Freedom Square\u2019 with the advent of the Young Turks revolution of 1908. In 1931, the square took the name it still officially bears today, Martyrs\u2019 Square, to commemorate the martyrs executed there under Ottoman rule and the Martyrs\u2019 Monument, Beirut was erected. \nFirst enclosed as a formal urban space in the 1860s, the Municipality of Beirut modernized the square in 1878 as the main meeting place of the city. Beshara Effendi designed a garden with fountain and kiosks, overlooked by the Petit Serail - the seat of Beirut\u2019s governor general \u2013 as well as public buildings and souks. The tramway, built in 1906, placed the square at the center of Beirut\u2019s transport network. During the early years of the French Mandate, the Duraffourd and subsequent Danger Plans created the \u2018Place de l\u2019Etoile\u2019 (Etoile Square). They proposed the demolition of the Petit Serail to open Martyrs\u2019 Square to the sea, an ambition that was foiled. The square was neglected and Etoile Square became the geographic and administrative center of the capital. \nIn 1931, it was renamed Martyrs\u2019 Square after those executed there on 6 May 1916, in the last years of Ottoman rule. The nationalists were a cross-confessional group that were fighting for Lebanon's autonomy and independence:\n\nEmir Aref Chehab\nSa\u00efd Akl, note the difference between the martyr and the modern-day poet\nFather Joseph Hayek\nAbdul Karim al-Khalil\nAbdelwahab al-Inglizi\nJoseph Bshara Hani\nMohammad Mahmassani\nMahmoud Mahmassani\nOmar Ali Nashashibi\nOmar Hamad\nPhilippe El Khazen, Journalist from Jounieh, Lebanon\nFarid El Khazen, brother of Philippe and also a journalist & editor\nSheikh Ahmad Tabbara\nPetro Paoli\nAbdel Ghani al-Arayssi, editor of al-Mufid newspaper\nMuhammad Chanti, publisher of ad-difa'a newspaper in Jaffa.\nGeorge Haddad, journalist and poet\nThe first Monument aux Martyrs was commissioned by the French Mandate authorities and unveiled on 19 December 1930, on the twentieth anniversary of the declaration of the state of Greater Lebanon. However, the statue by Youssef Hoyek - which became known as Les Pleureuses or the weeping women - was deeply unpopular after independence for its depiction of grieving Christian and Muslim mothers joining hands over a cremation urn. It was attacked with a hammer in 1948 before being finally removed in 1953, and is now displayed outside the Sursock Museum.The more triumphant Martyrs' Monument by Marino Mazzacuratti was inaugurated in 1960.\nIn 1950, the Petit Serail was demolished. The new Rivoli cinema blocked the link between the square and the harbor. Martyrs\u2019 Square became Beirut\u2019s bus and taxi terminus and a popular venue for cinemas, coffee-houses, modest hotels and the red-light district. \nDuring the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), Martyrs\u2019 Square formed the demarcation line that divided the city in half.\nIn 2005, an international competition was launched for the design of a new square with its axis open to the sea, reestablishing Martyrs\u2019 Square as Beirut\u2019s premier public space and heart of the capital.\nIn late 2019, Martyrs' Square became a major focal point of the anti-government protests.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1773: Initially Sahat al-Burj, it became Place du canon, after the Russian cannon that was placed on the square.\n1860: Renamed Place des canons after the Russian cannon was replaced by Cannons from the French fleet.\n1878: Municipality of Beirut modernized the square as the main meeting place of the city.\n1884: Named Hamidiyyeh Square in honor of Sultan Abdul Hamid II.\n1906: The tramway was built and placed the square at the center of Beirut's transport network.\n1908: Named Freedom Square following the advent of the Young Turks revolution.\n1931: The square took the name of Martyrs' Square in commemoration of the martyrs executed  there under Ottoman rule.\n1950: The demolition of the Petit Serail, which was earlier proposed during the early years of the French Mandate.\n1975-1990: Civil war, Martyrs\u2019 Square formed the demarcation line that divided the city in half.\n2005: International competition was launched for the design of a new square.\n\n\n== Pictures of Martyrs\u2019 Monument ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipality of Beirut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDavie, May (2001) Beyrouth 1825-1975.

        "wiki": "Bayt Beirut (Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e; literally \"the house of Beirut\") is a museum and urban cultural center celebrating the history of Beirut and namely the civil war. The cultural center is in the restored Barakat building, also known as the \"Yellow house\", a historic landmark designed by Youssef Aftimus.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Barakat house, commissioned by Nicholas Barakat and his wife Victoria, was designed and built in 1924 by Lebanese architect Youssef Aftimus, the architect who designed Beirut's city hall. In 1932 two more stories were added by architect Fouad Kozah, giving the building its current form.Middle-class families lived in the building's eight spacious apartments until the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war, when Christian militiamen moved in. The Barakat building became a vantage point for snipers overlooking a combat zone; it ensured the control of the Sodeco crossroad because of its airy architecture and due to its location on the demarcation line that separated the warring factions.The civil war devastated the Barakat building and neglect took its toll on the structure, which became the scene of repetitive acts of vandalism; it was sentenced for demolition in 1997 when the owners decided to sell the property. It was saved by Lebanese heritage activists, particularly architect Mona Hallak who first investigated the house in 1994 during one of her visits with the \"Association pour la Protection des Sites et Anciennes Demeures au Liban\" (APSAD), an independent organisation for the protection of historic monuments and buildings. Activists had articles about the structure published in the press almost on a daily basis, wrote petitions, and organized rallies in front of the building. Protestations finally led to the suspension of the decision to destroy the building. In 2003 the municipality of Beirut issued a decree of expropriation for public interest. The decree stated that the Barakat building will be restored to accommodate a memory museum and a cultural center (which will later be known as \"Beit Beirut\") with objects tracing the 7000-year history of the city. The decree also provisions the construction of a modern annex to the building on the empty lot around it, which will house offices of the municipality's urban planning department as well as an underground parking lot. The French government provided technical assistance to the Beirut municipality but the cultural specialists who were supposed to visit and counsel on the museum's development were delayed because of the 2006 and 2007 Lebanon conflicts and political instability. The Beit Beirut project was delayed until the return of relative political stability in 2008. The project saw the collaboration between the municipality of Beirut, the City of Paris and the French embassy in Lebanon. In 2009, Lebanese architect Youssef Haider was commissioned by the Beirut municipality to lead the building's restoration works. Even though Haidar had experience in rehabilitation as he had previously worked on the restoration of traditional buildings in downtown Beirut and Tripoli, his selection was contested since he was chosen without having recourse to an open competition. Haidar was assisted by a committee of architects formed by the Municipality of Paris; this committee has worked to develop the rehabilitation project of the museum and is formed by members from a variety of disciplines. Beit Beirut was slated to open in 2013 but didn't open until April 28, 2016; planning and restoration costs amounted to 18 million US dollars.Beit Beirut will temporarily re-open to the public in August 2017, despite lacking staff, services and direction.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Barakat building is built in the Ottoman revivalist style with ochre colored Deir el Qamar limestone which gave the building its name. The building consists of two four-story high-end residential blocks in addition to a roof terrace. The two blocks' facades are joined together by an open colonnade adorned with wrought iron work. The blocks are separated by a central atrium connecting to the main entrance to the landscaped garden in the backyard and to the buildings' staircases. The Barakat building stands on Damascus road, where a tramway station once stood.\n\n\n== Significance and function ==\nDuring the reconstruction phase that followed the Lebanese civil war, many important buildings were demolished. Activists were able to save a number of individual structures. The Barakat building with its bullet-peppered colonnade and facade became a dominant symbol of the civil war in Beirut.\nHistorians and sociologists have observed that a Lebanese tendency to disremember the civil war and its episodes that don't figure in the Lebanese history curriculum. The last chapter in the Lebanese history textbooks address the withdrawal of French colonial forces from Lebanon in 1946. Lebanese intellectuals and architects lobbying to save the Barakat building argued that the creation of a collective memory and a unified account of the civil war would help the Lebanese to move forward and mend the societal divisions. In 2007, then Beirut's mayor Abdel Menem al-Aris affirmed that the prospected memory museum will showcase the city\u2019s history and most notably the civil war. Although part the exterior is slated for renovation, the ground and first floors of the Barakat building's ruined facade will be kept in its decrepit state, to serve as a reminder of the city's wartime history. Bullet holes and sniper barricades are to be kept in their original places as well as the belongings of Fouad Chemali, a local dentist who occupied an apartment in the building's first floor since 1943.  The Beit Beirut second floor is to function as a permanent exhibition which recounts the history of Beirut from the nineteenth century onward. The exhibition will include documents, records and the municipality's archive which will be made accessible to the public. The upper floors will be renovated to house a multifunctional hall for temporary cultural, artistic and musical events.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nInitially known as Barakat building, the structure was dubbed the Yellow house due to the yellow ochre color of the sandstone. The name of the building changed with the alteration of its function; it was called the building of death during the civil war. The cultural center hosted in the building was first called \"Museum of memory\" and \"Beit al Madina\" (the house of the city) before settling for \"Beit Beirut\" (the house of Beirut).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Roman Berytus (Roman Baths) are located in the middle of downtown Beirut, Lebanon between Banks Street and Capuchin Street. The remains of a Roman bath of Berytus now surrounded by government buildings were found and conserved for posterity.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nRoman Berytus Baths is an ancient Roman thermae or bath site inside the Roman city of Berytus.  It was discovered in 1968-1969 and underwent major renovation in the mid-1990s.The archaeological ruin of one of the baths has been preserved and is occasionally used as a performance space, thus reflecting the ancient traditions of the site. One of the Baths is used as an artistic performance and concert space. The modern site is also home to Mediterranean-style gardens that contain a variety of medicinal plants once used in bathing balms.\nThe Roman bathhouse was a meeting place for all citizens. Roman Berytus had four major bath complexes (thermae). The bather moved from warm to hot baths, through rooms of varying temperatures. Located under the floor, the heating system (hypocaust) located under the floor allowed the air, warmed by wood fires in adjacent vaults, to circulate between pillars of terracotta disks that heated the marble floor; terracotta pipes in the walls allowed the air to rise up to the ceiling. Water from the boiler fed the marble-tiled pools in the hot room (caldarium), and a large stone basin (labrum) contained cool water for the bathers\u2019 use. The bathing routine ended with a body massage of therapeutic oils. The high vaulted, spacious halls of the bathhouse also accommodated performances of jesters and musicians. \nToday, the location of the Roman Baths is occasionally used as a performance space, thus reflecting the ancient traditions of the site. The modern garden contains also a variety of medicinal plants once used during classical times.\n\n\n== History ==\nRoman Berytus Baths were discovered in 1968, then underwent major renovation in the mid-1990s. \nThe Roman bathhouse was a meeting place for all citizens. Roman Berytus had four major bath complexes (thermae) and the first was created in the early first century under Augustus. An intricate network of lead or clay pipes and channels distributed the water from the Cisterns external to the Baths to the various pools of the Roman Baths. \nIn the second century was probably visited by the emperor Hadrian. The terrible Berytus earthquake -that happed in 551 AD- destroyed all the baths.\nToday, the Roman Berytus Baths  reflects the ancient traditions of the site.  One of the Baths is used as an artistic performance and concert space. The modern site is also home to Mediterranean-style gardens that contain a variety of medicinal plants once used in bathing balms.\nActually the gardens of these \"Baths\" are located inside the famous Garden of Forgiveness of modern Beirut.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBerytus\nRoman Baths\nThermae\nHypocaust\nCaldarium\nLabrum\nSerail Hill\nCisterns of the Roman Baths, Beirut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMouterde, Ren\u00e9 et Lauffray, Jean (1952) Beyrouth ville romaine, Publications de la Direction des Antiquit\u00e9s du Liban, Beyrouth.\nLauffray, Jean  (1977) \u00ab Beyrouth.

          "It is an open museum For traces and remains of Roman baths... Its floor was demolished, leaving only the mud structures that were used in the air heating system. It is located in the center of Beirut, between Banks Street and Kabbouchy Street. There is a small amphitheater",
          "This is an awesome place. I was amazed that an excavated Roman Bath was available to visitors and at no cost. Lately, information boards have been installed. These enrich one's visit. It is a pity that more is not made of such a wonderful attraction.",
          "Roman baths can be very interesting. The Roman bathing scene was highly evolved and stereotypical from city to city. From the frigidarium to the caldarium, all the elements are here including the hypocaust heating system. But you can't enter the ruins. The parts exposed are",
          "I visited it at both night and day, it's very difficult at night due to poor lighting. Also, no whatsoever service available around, could have been better with a small cafe or something. There's seating though, but I think it's poorly designed and does not give the proper",
          "Obviously I was used to Baalbek so I probably was expecting more from the stop at the Roman Baths but...there isn\u2019t much to see! Frankly the heating system that you can see is really interesting but unfortunately I was expecting a real sightseeing \u201csession\u201d and that wasn\u2019t the",

          "Very good example of a typical Roman Bath illustrating clearly the system of under floor heating. Part of the Bath is submerged under concrete, a pitty.",
          "good to have look while being around but not a place to go and visit on purpose. small and there are a lot of places that are better to see",
          "We were touring Place de l\u2019\u00e9toile and found these nice ruins. I wouldn\u2019t make it a must see but if you are in the area than it\u2019s worth a small detour. But don\u2019t organize your stay around it.",
          "The Roman baths are a little piece of history in between moder Beirut. It's just great that you can see back in history! Good information signs placed as well.",
          "Beautiful place located in the center of Beirut city showing the ancient Roman baths and there is a small garden more than",
          "one of must visist places , you can have nice pictures as well , it doesnt have a lot of information but sign boards gives you the details if you are without guide.",

          "i never expected to find this piece of history in beirut its located in the banking district a little jewel for history buffs",
          "A good place to visit if you are in central Beirut. You can\u2019t stop at the upper end of the roman baths as it\u2019s right next to the Government buildings. We stopped to take a few pictures and the security came and asked us to move along, although we were the only tourists there at",
          "The Roman baths are very accessible and close to other local land marks such as St George\u2019s cathedral and the al Amin mosque.",
          "One of major archaeological remains that was conserved in Beirut downtown, specially when six other roman baths were dismantled and removed by promoters",
          "It is rather amazing such great Roman infrastructure could survive even to the degree it has. You have to view it from above to protect the site. There are indicia of the aqueduct that carried water to this social setting. It is located near other tourist attractions and is",
          "Just off of the famous Beirut\u2019s Martyr Square and directly next to the side of the Saint George Maronite Cathedral are the remains of a Roman Cardo Maximus, which is a very special place to view and inspect. There are the five Roman columns which are the remnants of a Roman",
          "It is not very big and does not have much information in the place, it can go unnoticed easily. It is well worth the visit if you are near in Nijmeh Square or Beirut Souks.",
          "Apparently while excavating to build something else between the Greek Orthodox church of St. George and the Maronite Catholic Cathedral of St George, they found the remains of a very large Roman bath. Definitely worth spending a while looking at it. There are benches provided",
          "It\u2019s a must visit when in Beirut. A well preserved area and the surrounding is very nice as well. Amazed that it is right in the middle of the city. There is no entrance fees, just spend 15-30 mins enjoying the view.",
          "I am sure with some TLC this site could become a very touristic and much desired site to visit. The age of this site is baffling.",
          "The baths are well reconstructed and part of the historical area that is the only interesting spot in Beirut. Needs a 10-minute of Beirut visitors.",
          "We were on a tour and were amazed to find this treasure in the middle of city. I have traveled a long way in other countries and paid a lot of money to see less. Well worth looking this site up just round the corner from the clock tower.",
          "As someone who lives pretty near to Chester (a large Roman site) in the UK, you would think I wouldn\u2019t find this impressive. I was bowled over by a) the scale of the place b) the quality of the ruins and c) how it\u2019s right in the centre of the city - with commercial buildings on",
          "The Roman baths are located not far from the clock tower but can be missed if you don\u2019t have google maps. It is very interesting to see but besides that nothing else is going on around there. Allow 10-15 minutes.",
          "walking around Beirut downtown, you do not expect such a site. This is where Romans first invented hot water. The site is well preserved and is a must visit.",
          "Nice Roman baths, although there is better examples in other places. It is nice that they decided to preserve them, in between the fancy buildings.",
          "We were surprised to stumble upon this while walking back to our hotel one night. The city is built right around it! It is small in comparison to other Roman sites I have visited, but interesting just the same.",
          "Was taking a stroll downtown Beirut and out of nowhere, BANG!, There they were, Roman Baths, very unexpected that as you see the exquisite streets, shops and beautiful buildings in the downtown area, then all of a sudden these 6th century BC Roman Baths. But they add a rich",

          "Walking in the middle of new Beirut, there they were! Like an open hole filled with Roman antiquity. Tour leader barely stopped, so not much time to appreciate the wonder of it all.",
          "I have seen better, there are near all you can see during walking tour of Beirut, I repeat, just OK.",
          "Just a short walk from the Rolex Clock Tower, the Roman Baths is free to see and are viewable from the street. You look down upon the excavations from the street. However there were no information boards that I could see and luckily I had a guide to explain the history to me.",
          "As you explore the downtown of Beirut, it is important to remember the layers of history built upon each other from Phoenician to Roman. You cant walk around them but the site reinforces the amazing engineering of the Romans.",
          "Very close to the parliament, these roman baths are an interesting spot to be seen. Part of the journey of the city",
          "I advise you to have some can that can explain about Beirut. you can find some events on Facebook as 'Beirut free tours' a wonderful young guy that explain to the tourists about the history of this part of Beirut.",
          "Even though there is not much to see, it is still a must to pass by and check the remains of this roman bath in downtown Beirut when you are walking through the old/renovated city center.",
          "These Roma. bathes located under the parliament hill are actually not accessible to people as they fall in a deep pit. Although they are very interesting to look at, there is nothing done to keep a visitor standing for more than 5 minutes at the site . no historical",
          "Very interesting and well preserved roman ruins of Beirut. It good place to visit within a walk through downtown of Beirut. It is within walking distance of the Place L'Etoile.",
          "Very interesting, very well preserved site. You look down from pavement above. Shows all the original features of how Roman Baths worked.",
          "The most amazing part of looking at the Roman Baths is to imagine how the were operating almost 2000 years ago. The size is huge and just by looking at the construction I am amazed. Well worth a view, of cause you cant walk around in the ruins and touch the stuff but still worth",
          "Difficult to find, but certainly great to see. Great renovation, not much of explanation on the site itself.",
          "Hidden between the Banks' streets and the Grand Serail, this historical site is a very interesting attraction in the middle of downtown. You can sit on the stairs and admire this 2000-year-old structure that once was part of the Roman city of Berytus.",
          "After spending two days visiting places like Baalbeck and Byblys... this was a big disappointment. It was over run with weeds and rubbish. We almost missed it , it is so poorly marked. Amazing to think it still exists in the middle of a 7000 year old city. However, definitely",
          "This won't take long as they are not vast, but the ruins are worth a visit. They are right in the centre near lots of other sights in downtown.",
          "near the center of Beirut and many spots to view in the whole area. Roman Baths Great visit and good time",
          "Interesting to see the multitude of seating places in the bath, and the size. Nicely excavated, and made into a park in the middle of downtown.",
          "Historically significant, it's a shame you can't get into the ruins though. Pretty location, well worth passing by on a walk through town. Beware of the soldiers though.",
          "ok, it has its historical significance, but the roman ruins in beirut are not particularly remarkable, specially because there's not much information on the sights, and visit is limited to a reduced area. want some good roman ruins? take a day trip to baalbeck instead.",
          "Although I write that the rating is very good, you are only to look at it from above and it difficult to find explenations. But still it is amazing to see.",
          "While these ruins were found when rebuilding they are an interesting site for the mere fact that they are historically significant and still remain today after so much discord in the area.",
          "Right in the center of town and plenty of spots to view the whole area. Great visit for an hour or so.",
          "very nice, small, but very nice. hard to get in - it is in quarded area, but if you get in, do not miss it !",
          "Amazing Roman ruins right in the centre of town. You can wander all around the outside but can't actually go in.",
          "These are just something to see quickly from above. There is not a lot you can do and can't really access the area. They light it up at night as well, which is a fine time to see it as well.",
          "An ancient Roman Ruins located near the downtown of Beirut . . . The fences would keep a distance between you and the location . . A nice place to visit and take some photos . . The maximum time to spend would be around 15 minutes",
          "Lacks information and organization - sits to the side of the Great Mosque. Some detail about what you are viewing would be most helpful - reminder of the age of the city.",
          "This is a nice place to see eventhou is not really taken care of. Just a tiny little piece of the Roman history while in Lebanon.",
          "Well preserved remains of Roman baths just in the middle of the city near Place de L'Etoile. I was really surprised the area was deserted and there was no information about the site, just an empty board that was installed at some point probably - but with nothing written on it.",
          "I visited Beirut on business and had a free weekend. Recommend walking along the corniche (beach walkway) to old central Beirut. Several Christian churches, mosques, and ruined Roman baths. A lot of streets are secured or closed for construction. But it's a. I've walk and there",
          "They were closed to public access for the entire week we were there. I had a plains clothes security officer come up and demand that I delete all the photos I took from my camera. He stood and watched as I deleted each photo to be sure they were taken off. Security was insane",
          "These Roman baths are in a slightly hard to find location, but you can walk to them and it is certainly worth it. They are not that extensive but they are very well preserved.",
          "If you want to know more informations about this site, You must to pay for a guide. Few informations in the sign. No spend more than half hour. More than it, I recommend Beirut Museum.",
          "This is yet another reminder of the place in history held by Lebanon. An ancient Roman Baths that is quite extensive indicating the size of the Roman settlement. Begs the question, what else is still to be found in Beirut. Worth the visit.",
          "Historical and magnificent where the east meets the west. It depicted the rich and varied history of this country.",
          "While having a walk in Beirut Downtown pass by the Roman Baths which are open to public any day any time.",
          "Near the Al Amin Mosque and pl Etoile (7' walk). Nothing special, but if you stay several days here, it is worth a pic.",
          "Just opposite of the Serail the whole area is currently under military security. So be care what picture you take.",
          "The nice thing of these ruins is the fact that they are located just next to supermodern buildings. You have 2,000 years history enveloped in a block :) Per se, the ruins are not so wow, i wouldn't have visited them if I did not be in the area.",
          "Usually walk past it as you go around downtown. Great to see such a old structure in a modern part if the city. Gives a good perspective of the past",
          "I was not thrilled to see it, it is an ancient place sounded with modern big buildings. Next to it, is a pleasant park but because of the proximity to the Government Palace there were a lot of soldiers and you could not relax.",
          "Very interesting to see these ruins, as surrounding them is also the very old, old and new buildings of Beirut.",
          "The whole thing's been beautifully done as well, with seating and view points and the like. It's just a shame that there are no information boards explaining what you're looking at.",
          "It is all Roman beneath this part of the city attesting to its importance in antiquity. Apart from the baths remains, there are also extensive ruins in an L shape next to the very ancient Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George. Anyone with an interest in this era will consider",
          "When seeing the other sites in Beirut it is inevitable that you will pass by the Roman Baths. You just simply look over the railing for a few minutes and move on.",
          "if you want to see an ancient breath near the new building, so you have to visit this place near the downtown",
          "I've been a couple times while downtown just to take a minute and relax. It is very quiet and calming. The lighting comes on just as the sun is going down making it a very tranquil spot. The Map location is wrong and must be updated. It is located near the Souks.",
          "Rather interesting Roman remains, showing clearly behind-the-scenes (actually under-the-floor) constructions. You can't actually climb down among the remains but get a pretty good view from above and there are a couple of benches, too.",
          "I have never seen the ruins being worked on and they become more dwarfed all the time by the high rise buildings going up on all sides of Beirut.",
          "Wonderful place for a mid-day stroll. Nice surroundings (if you don't mind numerous checkpoints), safe, and clean. This historical site if a great reminder of Lebanon's fabulous past.",
          "This is one of the better preserved Roman Baths I have seen. It is a quick visit but there are places to sit nearby. Don't plan to spend more than 45 minutes here. Best to include in other planned activities for that day (such as seeing the Ottoman clock tower).",
          "Impressive and well preserved ruins, right in the middle of the city. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Very nice almost intact underground Roman baths , very well maintained with all details of chambers and water passages , not to miss if you visit downtown Beirut",
          "Lovely to see the preservation of history in such a place.Nicely lit at night this makes a nice quiet place to walk past if you take in the soukes and other rebuilt areas.",
          "I have seen Roman Bath excavations before in several parts of the Middle East, but this one simply wowed me. It is the remains of a very large bath house, that is in excellent condition. It is also in a very pretty section of downtown Beirut, near the Place de L'Etoile. It's",
          "If you are into history, this place is a must, the huge columns make you feel the thrill, it;s defiantly a place of art",
          "At city centre of Beirut . Nice quite historical place that you can reach it by walking . All interesting places are nearby.",
          "hidden in the middle of the city it is a great surprise. You feel like you stepped in the past for a few seconds. best way to visit is as part of the whole downtown area.",
          "Our guide told us how the whole of area around Beirut has many layers from past civilizations and this one shows the Romans",
          "I expect to see this kind of ruin in Rome, but didn't expect it in downtown Beirut! What a treasure and I am so glad it is as well-preserved as it is. See this when you visit!",
          "If you have been and seen other roman baths don't loose your time going there, especially if it is walking as there are some roads blocked by army (December 2015). You can travel elsewhere as lebanon has a lot of places worth a visit like Baalbek Tripoli Biblos etc...",

        "wiki": "The Jeita Grotto (Arabic: \u0645\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u0639\u064a\u062a\u0627\u200e) is a system of two separate, but interconnected, karstic limestone caves spanning an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi). The caves are situated in the Nahr al-Kalb valley within the locality of Jeita, 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Though inhabited in prehistoric times, the lower cave was not rediscovered until 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; it can only be visited by boat since it channels an underground river that provides fresh drinking water to more than a million Lebanese.\nIn 1958, Lebanese speleologists discovered the upper galleries 60 metres (200 ft) above the lower cave which have been accommodated with an access tunnel and a series of walkways to enable tourists safe access without disturbing the natural landscape. The upper galleries house the world's largest known stalactite.  The galleries are composed of a series of chambers the largest of which peaks at a height of 12 metres (39 ft).Aside from being a Lebanese national symbol and a top tourist destination, the Jeita grotto plays an important social, economic and cultural role in the country. It was one of top 14 finalists in the New 7 Wonders of Nature competition.\n\n\n== Location ==\n \nThe Jeita cave is situated at the center of the western flanks of the Lebanon mountains, more specifically in the Nahr al-Kalb valley, its natural entrance is about 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level. It's located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) east of the Mediterranean coastline and 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of Beirut within the confines of the municipality of Jeita, in the caza of Keserwan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAncient vestiges of a foundry were found in a smaller cave near the Nahr al-Kalb river, suggesting that the cave was used in antiquity to produce swords.The modern discovery of the underground river of Jeita in 1836 is credited to Reverend William Thomson (an American missionary) who ventured some 50 metres (160 ft) into the cave. Reaching the underground river, he fired a shot from his gun and the resulting echoes convinced him that he had found a cavern of major importance.In 1873 W.J. Maxwell and H.G. Huxley, engineers with the Beirut Water Company, and their friend Reverend Daniel Bliss, president of the Syrian Protestant College (later the American University of Beirut) explored these caverns. In two expeditions carried out in 1873 and 1874, they penetrated 1,060 metres (3,480 ft) into the grotto before finding their progress blocked by an underground waterfall. The waterfall became known as \"Hell's Rapids\", as the torrents break onto razor sharp rocks. Dr. Bliss, Mr. Maxwell and the other engineers recorded their names and the year on \"Maxwell's Column\", a great limestone pillar some 625 metres (2,051 ft) from the entrance. About 200 metres (660 ft) further on, in the so-called \"Pantheon\", they wrote their names and details of the expedition on paper, sealed it in a bottle and placed it on top of a stalagmite. The lime-impregnated water has since covered the bottle with a thin white film, permanently fixing it to the stone.\nBetween 1892 and 1940 further expeditions were carried out by English, American and French explorers. Their expeditions brought them to a depth of 1,750 metres (5,740 ft).\nSince the 1940s, Lebanese explorers have pushed even deeper into the Jeita grotto. Many of these spelunkers are members of the Speleo Club du Liban (Lebanese Caving Club) founded in 1951 by the first Lebanese speleologist Lionel Ghorra. Their expeditions revealed a great underground system which is now explored to an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi).In 1958 the lower caverns were opened to the public, meanwhile exploration was still underway mainly by the Lebanese Caving Club.  This exploration led to the discovery of the elevated dry branch of the grotto later referred to as the upper galleries.In 1962, the Sp\u00e9l\u00e9o Club contributed to a study of the upper galleries aiming to provide an access tunnel which was to be dug for touristic development purposes. Work on the access tunnel was begun in 1968.  Its opening was followed by the installation of a  series of walkways which permitted tourists safe access to the upper galleries without disturbing the natural landscape.In 1969, a concert with electronic music by the French composer Francois Bayle was held in the cave to celebrate the inauguration of the upper galleries. This event was organized by the Lebanese artist and sculptor Ghassan Klink. Other cultural events have taken place in this unusual surrounding, including a concert by the world acknowledged German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in November 1969, and more recently, in 2008 a classical music concert by Lebanese-Armenian composer and pianist Guy Manoukian.The caverns closed to the public due to the Lebanese civil war in 1978; both tunnels leading to the lower and upper galleries were used to store munitions, and the outside buildings for military purposes. The caves reopened in 1995 and remain one of the country's key natural attractions.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nJeita I (sometimes referred to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres deep to the east of the source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive potsherds, burned bones and end scrapers. Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the N\u00e9olithique Moyen period of Byblos. Evidence of later occupation included a Chalcolithic tripod pot found by Father Fleisch and a combed-ware sherd suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age levels at Byblos.Jeita II (Dahr el-Mghara) is a rock shelter situated on a platform, above and equidistant between the dry cave of Jeita I and the entrance to the grotto at Jeita III. Excavations were made by the Duc de Luynes and Lartet in 1864, by Zumoffen in 1900 and 1908 and by Bergy in 1930. A large number of flint tools, bones and hearths were found that were accredited to the Aurignacian. Further excavations were made in 1964 by Francis Hours which revealed much more extensive, deeper and richer deposits than had previously been suspected. Father Hours permitted Lorraine Copeland to disclose that the upper material appeared to display late Upper Paleolithic or early Mesolithic characteristics, probably including Kebaran. Excavation was to be continued but the area was fenced off and owned by the government.Jeita III (The Caverns) was a deposit of brown soil that fell from a location suggested to be at the east end of Jeita II, just inside the entrance to the grotto where the tourists are conducted by boat. It was found in 1963 by the Speleologists Club and excavated by Father Hours. Flint tools found in the deposit were geometric in design and suggested to be a form of Natufian or later Mesolithic than discovered at Jeita II, from where it may have been displaced. Forms of these flints included rectangles with straight or oblique truncation, borers of the \"crochet\" type, micro-burins, end scrapers, bladelet cores, two transverse arrowheads, crescents and short triangles. Some of the crescents had ridged backs and resembled those found at Nahal Oren. Material is stored with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory.Jeita IV (Mugharet-el-Mal) is a rock shelter in the cliff upstream from the grotto. It once contained a large quantity of Paleolithic material which has been looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further light on the Paleolithic or Mesolithic communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Jeita grotto is located within the Lower-Middle Jurassic strata of Keserouane which has a stratigraphic thickness of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and consists of dolomite and micritic limestone. The Keserouane formation was exposed to air by a local uplift during  the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. The Keserouane strata became karstified after its aerial exposure and then was buried during the Cretaceous. In the Neogene, upon the final uplift of Mount Lebanon, this early karstification phase was reactivated.\nAt the Nahr al-Kalb valley, the impervious Upper Jurassic volcanic rocks and Lower Cretaceous sand slant almost vertically forming a hydrogeological barrier and forcing the outlet of the Jeita underground river to the surface. This barrier could be the reason for the westernmost, large cave chambers with heights exceeding 60 metres (200 ft). Karstification of the Keserouane limestone was further intensified by the steep topography of the area and the volume of precipitation over the Lebanon (more than 1200mm).A ratio of total slope gradient of 1/100 is calculated between the entrance of the cave and its inland extremity. This shows its smooth flat course even though it is sometimes interrupted by several small cascades and rapids. From the west, the Jeita cave starts with large halls and meanders. Through some rapids, the dimension becomes narrower. Going forth, it is spacious with the Thompson's cavern (250 metres (820 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide), Grand Chaos (500 metres (1,600 ft) long) and Mroueh's Hall (200 metres (660 ft) long and 50 metres (160 ft) wide). The latter two are floored with collapsed blocks. The cave ends with a Y-shaped pattern, where, each branch ends with a siphon.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Jeita caves are solutional karst caves which have formed over millions of years due to the dissolution of limestone. The limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid charged rain water and groundwater; when the limestone, which is originally waterproof, contains cracks produced by tectonic forces the water oozes into the rock and starts to widen the cracks and solute caves inside the layers. Jeita is the longest cave complex in the Middle East; it sits at 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level and has a height difference of 305 metres (1,001 ft).  Geologically, the caves provide a tunnel or escape route for the underground river, which is the principal source of Nahr al-Kalb.The Jeita grotto is the longest explored cave in Lebanon. After many years of exploration, speleologists have penetrated about 6,200 metres (20,300 ft) from the entry point of the lower grotto to the far end of the underground river and about 2,130 metres (6,990 ft) of the upper galleries.\n\n\n=== Upper cave ===\nThe Jeita upper cave has an overall length of 2,130 metres (6,990 ft) of which only 750 metres (2,460 ft) are accessible to visitors via a specially conceived walkway; access to the remainder of the cave was restricted to prevent ecological damage which may occur due to the flocking tourists. The upper cave contains a great concentration of a variety of crystallized formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, mushrooms, ponds, curtains and draperies. The upper gallery is famous for its formations, lit by an effective lighting system. It is entered through a 117 metres (384 ft) long concrete tunnel. The part accessible by visitors has three huge chambers. The first is called the White Chamber, the second Red Chamber.\nWhite dripstones are pure calcite without defilement, the red color is given by iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon, iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in northern countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces a different kind of iron oxide.\nThe White Chamber is medium-sized, but has the most impressive formations of the cave. The Red Chamber is up to 106 metres (348 ft) high, and 30 metres (98 ft) to 50 metres (160 ft) wide. The third chamber is the biggest of all three chambers and has a height of more than 120 metres (390 ft). The longest stalactite in the world is located in Jeita's White Chamber; it measures 8.2 metres (27 ft) long.\n\n\n=== Lower cave ===\nThe lower gallery which has an overall length of 6,200 metres (20,300 ft) is located 60 metres (200 ft) below the upper gallery. It is traversed by a smooth underwater river and a lake (the \"Dark Lake\"). The river is broken up by several small cataracts and rapids. The lower cave's \"Thompson's Cavern\", is a massive hall with impressive speleothems such as the Eagle Obelisk stalagmite. Other halls in the lower gallery include the Pantheon, Grand Chaos and Shangri-la. Visitors are transported in the lower gallery by electric boats for a distance of 500 metres (1,600 ft). In winter the lower level is closed, when the water level is too high.\n\n\n== Economic and social importance ==\n\nToday, the Jeita Grotto is a popular recreational show cave and a major tourist attraction. It hosts approximately 280,000 visitors per year.The Jeita grotto contributes heavily to the public life of the region. MAPAS, the firm which runs the grotto, is an important employer and provides full-time jobs for around 115 local residents of Jeita (30% of which are female). In addition to employment, the Jeita caves contribute 5% of ticket fees to the local municipality, between 10 and 20% of general revenue to the Lebanese ministry of tourism, and an additional 10% of ticket fees along with the 10% VAT to the Lebanese ministry of Finance.Moreover, the Jeita cave emits a spring with a flow ranging from 1\u20132 m3/s, providing fresh drinking water for one-and-a-half million inhabitants of the capital, Beirut. However, water pollution, due to domestic and agricultural runoff, remains a serious concern as recent analysis detected an increasing presence of coliform bacteria.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2002, then French President Jacques Chirac, the United Nations World Tourism Organization and the World Bank accorded the top Sustainable Development in Tourism prize to MAPAS (the company that manages the site) at a summit dubbed \u201cNew Ties between Tourism and Culture\u201d in Geneva.\nIn December 2003, on behalf of the Beirut-based private company MAPAS, Jeita received a prestigious award from the fifth Tourism Summits in Chamonix, France. \"Les sommets du tourisme\" recognized MAPAS\u2019 efforts in restoring Lebanon's important touristic sites.The Jeita Grotto was a candidate for the New 7 Wonders of Nature competition. It was selected as one of 28 finalists and is the only cave to be selected among the nominees. The New7Wonders Foundation announced the new wonders of nature in 2011. Jeita was not on the list.\nOther awards and certificates include:\n\n2000 Certificate of Recognition from \"Sukleen\"-Lebanon for its sorting and recycling campaign.\n2000 Appreciation from the Arab Musical Association\".\n1998 \"Best Tourism Project\" from the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism.\n1997 International Environmental Award from the German Travel Association (DRV).\n\n\n== Other names ==\n\nThe name of the cave changed several times since its discovery. Initially referred to as the Grottoes of Nahr al-Kalb, it was subsequently known as Djaita, Jehita, and finally Jeita. Nahr al-Kalb is the name of the river that runs through the grottoes, while  Jeita, meaning \"roaring water\" in Aramaic, is the town in which the cave's entrance is located. The transition from Grottoes of Nahr al-Kalb to Jeita Grottoes occurred in 1927 as newspapers widely used the latter name.\n\n\n== Numismatics and philately ==\nIn 1961, Jeita became a national symbol when Lebanese authorities issued a stamp featuring the lower cavern to promote national tourism. Mr. Maroun Hajj, the oarsman shown on the stamp, still leads boat tours forty years after the stamp was issued. The Jeita Grotto is also featured on the 1964 one Lira (Lebanese pound) verso.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nSeveral scenes of the 1977 Hindi film Chandi Sona (starring Sanjay Khan and Parveen Babi) were shot at the site.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJeita Grotto website\n360 HD Panoramas of Jeita Grotto\n360 Jeita grotto, the lower cave\nJeita Grotto at Beautiful World",

          "One of the world\u2019s best attractions. The natural, the size, the landscapes are all incredible. I wish there were enough good hotels around for visitors to spend more time there.",
          "It is the biggest and the most beautiful Cave we have ever seen. There are two levels you can visit - Upper level is the main one, with long path allowing you to see stunning Cave formations. The lower level is smaller, there is a lake here and you can take a boat to see it. We",
          "Beautiful caves but don\u2019t take photos or you might have your phone confiscated. Annoying because of the number of tourists and some peoples\u2019 inability to listed to or understand rules, you are not allowed to take photos inside these beautiful caves. Normally the harm, I believe,",
          "A visit to Lebanon would not be complete without seeing this natural wonder that is just a short drive from Beirut. Photos are absolutely not permitted inside. The positive side of this, is that you are left to marvel at the dramatic rock & mineral formations without any",
          "Lebanon does not have too many tourist attractions. You have to experience the country itself as a whole. But Jeita Grotto is different. It is a different world belonging to the earth itself. Just amazing. You can keep your phone with you if you can. There is not any strict",
          "REMOVE THE ZOO!!! The caves are absolutely stunning and speak for themselves; you can see that from the other reviews. What I want to mention is the totally pointless and disgusting mini-zoo you have the misfortune to walk through at the end of your visit??? Dirty tiny cages!",
          "Although this cavern is overtouristed, it truly is a marvel. You take a gondola to the upper cabin which is full of stalagmites and stalactites of varying shapes and sizes. Then, after a downhill walk, you enter the lower cave and take a short boat ride on an underground lake.",
          "No picture taking is allowed. According to one of the guards it is to prevent chaos from happening when it is overcrowded inside that causes a bottleneck. However, due to recent political developments we were the ONLY tourists inside the cave, and yet they didn't allow us to",
          "We were a group ranging from 9-71 years old and we all loved the trip. The caves are huge and so impressive. We loved the walk around the upper caves and boat ride in the lower caves as well. The cable car at the beginning is fun and it\u2019s so beautiful to see the trees and",
          "Just Amazing......You will remember this place rest of your life. I was traveling with my spouse and baby and there you will find all support and facilities. You can take your mobile with you and only at the entry of the cave you need to submit it. then again outside you can",
          "Really beautiful place and a must if you visit Beirut. It's hard to grasp the scale from photos, but once you are inside, you really can see it. First part is on foot, then the second by boat. Sadly, photographs are banned from inside, but you'll have your memories :-)",
          "As a Lebanese I'm very proud to say that I would definitely recommend this place for travelers. It's just amazing and interesting to see this beautiful cave and learn about it.",
          "There are two caves, an upper & a lower. I was very much looking forward to the lower cave because you go through on a boat & the pictures I had seen were amazing. But it was the upper cave that stole the show. It is absolutely massive. Other than that it is hard to describe.",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit. You start by using a cable car to gain access to the cave and then descend in a wally trolley to visit the lower cave where you go by a boat. Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited the caves during a day trip out from Beirut which included also Byblos and Harissa. The caves were in two sections, the lower caves and the upper caves in which we had to take a cable car. The upper caves were massive with a very long walkway with steps up and down.",
          "Such a wonderful place to visit the caves. Amazing views with lot to see in both Upper part where we walk and Lower Part where their is a short Boat Ride of about 10 mins. According to me is a Number 1 place to Visit in Lebanon.",
          "I was a bit critical initially if the price of about $10 was justified, but I was absolutely not disappointed. The cave is HUGE, very beautiful and well maintained. The price also includes a little boat trip as well as a cable-car ride to the cave, a little tourist train takes",
          "Enjoyed the panaromic view of nature in the cable car ride up to the caves. The spectacular beauty of the extraordinary amazing limestone formations stunned me no end. The upper grotto is a peaceful walk. Came down in a train. The Lower grotto has to seen in a boat. The boat",
          "Jeita Caves are beautiful and peaceful- having seen many caves throughout the world I did not expect this to be any different but they were lovely, quiet and great that you cannot take photos which keeps the tourists flowing through \u2013great trip on the boat in the lower cave too.",
          "I must say it was one of the places which makes you speechless and just feel it. Wonderful sight and amazing experience. Disappointed that they were not allowing to take pictures inside. If I will travel again, will definitely visit this place again. Recommended 100%",

          "From a reasonably unimpressive entrance this grotto (once you get in) is a natural wonder that's hard to put into words. Don't be deceived, it's easily a solid 20 min walk from start to finish even without much stopping to gaze in awe at the rock formations (which you will!)",

          "This place boasts not one but 2 huge caves, one upper cave which is marvelous and has a lot of charm to it, the other is by boat, the lower cave and also has its mysterious charm. Its a magical wonder of nature and beautiful place to visit with friends or family.",
          "Surely you do not believe that you can find a different and strange place like this , within a few kilometres of Beirut. A magical place full of peace with mysterious images. I suggest you spend a perfect day in this place and around it.",
          "Great place. Nice sceneries. Must Vist. Amazing Stalactite and Stalagmite. Some places the cave is so huge with the ceiling up to 70-80m high. Loved the boat ride in the lower parts. Nice clear waters.",
          "Family of four visited Jeita Grotto in early August. Tickets are fairly priced for what you get. They have a website in English if you want details. Basically you get a cable ride up, upper grotto walking tour, train car ride to lower grotto where you get a boat tour. Also have",
          "Amazing millions of years old caves with a beautiful view of the nearby hills. We especially enjoyed the boat ride through the lower area. Our guide was wonderful at explaining the different types of cave formations. It\u2019s a must visit for sure.",
          "A must see for anyone who goes to Lebanon and also for those who live there. Simply stunning, you can go so many times and still be amazed. Very well organised and staff are friendly. Highly recommended and make sure you visit both caves, up and the river one down.",
          "Great attraction. The grotto is extraordinary. We were shocked! ... It costed 18,000 LL. Highly recommend.",
          "Jeita Grotto consists of two very impressive large caves. The upper and larger one, full of wonderful stalactites and stalacmites, can be visited by walking, while the lower one is can be visited by a boat. Unfotunately it is not allowed to take any pictures of the gorgeous",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect, but the entire experience was amazing! The site itself: I have never seen anything like it before. The stalagmites and stalactites are so huge, making some amazing formations, which you can spend hours interpreting! The upper cave has an immensely",
          "We were part of a group tour which was great. Organized through Nakhal Tours. Our tour guide Natasha is fantastic. Ask for her. Natasha is an Archeologist and so knowledgeable about Lebanon. There are two parts, upper and lower cave. Lower, you go in a boat for about 100m on the",
          "I still didn\u2019t visit the place I called to ask a lot of questions Rana from call center was the person who helped Answered every single question patiently and happily making me really want to come to the place It\u2019s very good for someone to be welcoming from the start Thanks",
          "Really enjoyed this cave. The formations were awesome. There are 2 parts to this tour. One you will walk through and the second is a boat ride. Photography is not allowed.",
          "It's a great spot to see limestones. Unfortunately you can't take camera/phone with you so can't take pictures. It's worth of the trip. Entry fee was around 10\u20ac",
          "Amazing breath taken tourist sight not to be missed Place well maintained & friendly staff were available to assist . Unfortunately No photos allowed . Visit hours ends at 5 pm , cafe\u2019s and toilets available also car parking for a fee . Highly recommend . Enjoy . NK",
          "If someone is visiting from abroad, he/she has to visit this natural beauty! There are 2 main grottos: the top one which is accessible in all seasons, and the other one which is not because water levels are high in Winter. At the exit, you can see a couple of animals and some",
          "The caves are beautiful and fascinating to visit. The boat trip in the lower cave is a dream however too short. Photos are not allowed but it is really worthy for the administration to rethink it. I propose special cameras to be installed at certain locations operated by the",
          "For my Grand Children\u2019s first visit to this place and Riding a small boat to Explore the Grotto very nice illuminated with the huge Stalactites & Stalagmites was a very Beautiful Experience..",
          "There are no words to describe the beauty of these caves. I was on a business trip to Beirut and on our last day 6 of us shared a car to take us to Jeita Grotto. It is located outside of Beirut on the mountains in a valley. Once you leave the main road the scenery is beautiful",
          "This natural wonder is spectacular and unlike anything of this sort due to the sheer size of these natural formations. There are similar caves in Slovenia for example, but J. Grotto is so big that it\u2019s what makes it that much more impressive. Also, the scenic ride to get up here",
          "I have been to these grottos five times and their beauty never ceases to anaze me like it is my first visit. For a full experience, I would advise you to visit both grottos and ride the telepherique. Enjoy!",
          "It was my first time visiting a cave and this is not your regular cave. The cave is really huge, on two levels, and very impressive. The views are breathtaking and you feel like on a movie set or almost like if you were on Mars. Bring the right shoes because it could be",
          "If this is your first time at Lebanon \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde7 don\u2019t miss this interesting place It is really worth to be visited, okay you are prevented from taking photos but you can do it if you want \ud83d\ude05 it is really awesome \ud83d\ude0e Highly recommended",
          "If you ever come to Lebanon, this is a must see (You do know it is considered one of the top wonders of the world) and you must know some of the amazing facts about it so either get a tour guide or ask the staff inside. It is just AMAZING!",
          "Jeita Grotta is one of the new world's wonders of nature. It's less than 20klm away from Beirut and a must see for every visitor. It's natural beauty will satisfy even the most demanding pair of eyes. I would recommend that you be there at the opening time, if you want to enjoy",
          "Don't miss Jeita if you're visiting Lebanon. The experience is unique: nice view on the way to Jeita, informative videos about the grotto's discovery, breathtaking views inside and an entertaining boat trip to finish the visit. No cams / phones are allowed inside (lockers",
          "Woowww! I really can\u2019t find enough words to describe how beautiful these 2 caves are! Oh God! And the t\u00e9l\u00e9f\u00e9rique & the tram allow you to see the beauty more & more.. You take the t\u00e9l\u00e9f\u00e9rique to the first cave, walk through it, then take the tram to the second one, you take like",
          "I went to Jeita Grotto 3 times, but everytime I get amazed. There are 2 main huge caves, with a small boat ride in one of them.",
          "Jeita is one of the world wonders, with 2 huge caves: the upper one with magnificent stalactites and stalagmites and the lower one which has a lake.",
          "When we signed up to a tour, I was not expecting much - was just keen to see other parts, outside of Beirut. I think nothing prepared me for the caves. Very unassuming when you walk in and then the upper cave opens up and it's massive, magical and I am surprised it did not make",
          "The grotto is split into 2 parts - the upper has breath taking views of stone curtains, columns, draperies and mushrooms, with the winding path taking you a few hundred metres into its total length of 2200m. At its deepest part, a 32-storey building can be fitted inside. The",
          "What to say - must see. Pity, there id no possibility to take the picture. After back home, I just can to tell everybody - must to go to Lebanon and visit the caves. Awesome experience. I am sure it is one of the wonders of the nature worldwide.",
          "With only one ticket you will get access to two caves, gondola lift and an small train. The caves are such a WOW as they are between the mountains. you'll enjoy a lot in there.",
          "Wonderful trip in Jeita grotto specially the boat trip,with low cost ticket Recommended place to visit",
          "I\u2019ve always heard about this place but never managed to go there on my business travels to Lebanon. This time I did, and surely was not disappointed. Getting there was quite amazing too despite traffic, scenery is just beautiful. But the grotto is something out of this world.",
          "I visited Jeita Grotto as part of a tour group. The first part was on foot following a brief cable car ride and took about 20 minutes wandering around the pathway inside. We then got the mini train back down (although it\u2019s walkable) and then we did the underground boat trip",
          "Go early to see the caves before the bus tours! Arrived 9.15 and headed straight to the upper grotto via cable car. Phones and cameras are placed in lockers to avoid temptation, and being early we had the beautiful caves to ourselves. Lots of walking, including some steps, much",
          "The famous Jeita Caves (Grotto) about one hour from central Beirut allowing for traffic. Visit takes about two hours. Good parking (small charge). Good on site transportation; cable car and land train. First cave is extensive with beautiful views from good concrete walkway",
          "Great natural wonder, other than that I found Lebanon pretty boring and went 2x and never again. When you go that distance and spend lots you do not want to be handcuffed by cheapness and security problems.",
          "We strategically got there early to ensure we would miss the crowds and we were first in line to the top of the Grotto. We took the cable car up and the train down to the lower grotto where we went through in a boat. We walked the Upper Grotto - you have to leave your cameras",
          "Visitors walk on the upper level, and ride in a boat at the lower level. I have been to three major and one minor cave in the USA, and this was comparable--even better in some respects. One is close to the formations, which are extensive and impressive.",
          "Amazing astonishing mesmerizing. Need to visit this place. One of the most beautiful places you\u2019ll ever get to see. Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d",
          "The big grotto is absolutely breathtaking. We\u2019ve been to a few in New Zealand, Australia, Faroe Islands and other places in the world. But never with the size and depth as this one! Truly amazing! Come in the morning to avoid too many visitor. Note that there\u2019s no cameras",
          "One hour tour and feel like speleologist ! The upper cave is walking accessible,and the lower by boat.Both caves breathtaking ! Climbing the cave is by cable car and downhill by foot or by a train.Cost is 12 USD per person.It is amazing place in and out !",
          "I\u2018ve been in various caves and haven\u2018t been very motivated to go to another one. But it\u2018s just breathtaking. I was there around 9.30 and in certain areas of the first cave alone. A great experience! The first cave has the atmosphere of a cathedral. Huge size and impressive",
          "Had visited other stalactite caves, but nothing compared to the massiveness, impressiveness and awe of this one.",
          "One of Excellent place in Beirut and must see, it will be better to visit it in summer to be able to visit both caves(upper and lower cave).",
          "If you're in Beirut a trip to these caves are well worth a visit! The tour begins with a short cable car ride to the upper grotto which you explore on foot.The cave itself is wonderful to experience and very well lit. This is followed by a short tram ride to the lower cave which",
          "If you do nothing else go and see these caves. Mind blowingingly amazing. Surely one of the wonders of the world. Not busy when we went on Wednesday lunchtime even though its a holiday.",
          "I was absolutely amazed by the caves. An absolute wonder, the caves are mesmerizing. I do recommend you go first thing in the morning as it does get very busy. They open at 9 am. Do both the upper and lower caves.",
          "A fantastic place. 2 caves to see. so majestic inside. One of the best places I have ever been. Once you go inside you feel that you are not on the planet. Can take a boat ride into the bottom cave and it is fantastic. this is a must see place. never seen anything like it. would",
          "This was a total (fantastic) surprise to us. If you enjoy exploring caves to see some amazing formation this is the place to go. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photographs but hey this is a memory that will last and it makes you watch more carefully rather than",
          "My guide recommended I go early to the caves. He was right. My girlfriend and I arrived at opening time at 9:00 am and it the buses had not arrived yet. We made it to the upper caves first. Breathtaking. (Bring a jacket because it's 16 degrees year around) we then went to the",
          "To tell the truth, I had never even heard of Jeita Grotto outside Beirut, before reading about it earlier this month while doing my pre-visit Net research about Lebanon, a mandatory SOP for me before visiting a new country. What I read aroused deep interest. But what i actually",
          "Wonderful experience and a must see for every visitor of Lebanon. To reach the entrance of the grotto you have to use a cable car. The upper grotto is a 'walking' experience, the lower one will be seen while sitting in a small boat.",
          "Definitely must go!!Especially the second cave with the lake,amazing!!It is one in a lifetime experience!",
          "You can really feel how old it is, just by looking at its huge stalactites and stalagmites. Definitely a place to visit. Closed on Mondays.",
          "The grotto itself is wonderful although bizarre that you cannot take photos and nobody explained why. However my lasting memory will be of the mini-zoo which is just abused animals and serves no benefit - it should be shut immediately. I went over to see the rabbits and one was",
          "Did not expect this to be as good as it was! It was incredible. Two tiers, top tier is vast with caverns and geological wonders everywhere. The bottom tier is where you take a boat ride through the caverns.",
          "We went t the grotto on a rainy day during the Christmas holiday. it was fantastic! No wait at all to go up the hill and then the walk through the grotto was very spectacular. We talked to some of the guys who were there for security and they were knowledgeable about the",
          "Unlike any cave or cavern I have ever come across. Well worth a day trip to this place along with Harissa when in Beirut.",
          "I would highly recommend visiting this place, it's like nothing you will have seen before. I loved going on the boat through the cave. It's something that just would not be allowed in the UK due to health and safety. It felt like a little adventure.",
          "Can't recommend this place highly enough, we loved the experience and I very much doubt we'll see such a natural spectacle elsewhere. Well worth a trip.",
          "We had a terrible service experience at this place. We had to wait more than half an hour for the train. There were some cages full of animals in awful conditions. They force you to leave your belongings outside to avoid to take pictures just because they want to sell you their",
          "The Jeita Grotto (Arabic: \u0645\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u0639\u064a\u062a\u0627) is a system of two separate, but interconnected, karstic limestone caves spanning an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi). From Beruit city it was a 25/30mins taxi journey costing $70 return from our hotel. This is a MUST SEE. \ud83d\ude4f",
          "I visited the Jeita Grotto last December, I was there by myself. The place is awesome and is strongly recommend for Lebanon visitors. You should first find a good transportation to get you there especially if you are going there alone. I took a taxi from my hotel to Sharl",
          "A day well spent at Jeita Grotto. We couldn't get any pictures from this place may be that it why this place leaves a mark on everyone who goes here. You feel what you see. You cannot show someone. The creation is amazing the upper grotto is better and good walking area but the",
          "Fun day, good tour and very historic and beautiful. Make sure you visit if you are in Beirut, its a very quiet area",
          "If you have not visited Jeita Grotto while travelling to Lebanon, then you have missed a gem of natural beauty. The grotto with both of its caves is amazing with its lovely colorful stone formations. The area is very scenic and you can enjoy it while going up to the caves in the",
          "exceptional place to visit, the visit took around two hours ,it\u00b4s wonderfull inside, i can rate it 10/10",
          "The natural formations in this grotto were among the best & most spectacular that I have seen. It was easily accessible and easy to look around with good walkways. I marked this attraction down from 5 to 4 stars because I was disappointed that photography was not permitted",
          "This was a great experience for me, and I was truly in awe of this experience. When you arrive, you take a small cable car to the upper cavern. Inside, you truly realize what nature is capable of, with stalactites over five meters in length and a winding path that lets you",
          "Be aware Pictures now are forbidden You have to let your camera AND cell phone at the entrance Another thing , there is 2 caves The lower one is smaller but you visit it by boat The bigger one is huge and high it s fantastic",
          "It's not often that I would use the term 'must see' but here it is relevant. Negotiate the constant Beirut traffic in a taxi for fifty dollars return including waiting time. The entrance fee is very reasonable amount and includes a cable car to the larger grotto, then an",
          "Amazing experience. Do both caves with the higher one being the most magnificent. Never seen anything like it. Take your time and don't hesitate to ask the people along the path questions. Tourists hardly speak to them, yet they have lots of information to provide.",
          "It\u2019s amazing place in the mountains, I really loved it, it\u2019s a natural two separate grottos very big about 9 kilometer, but you can\u2019t see all of it because some places it\u2019s very tight, we see the upper one by Aerial lift ( teleferak )and we see the lower one by boat . I asked",
          "Best time to go is first thing in the morning. There were only 2 or 3 persons there around 9am. Car parking costs about $2 dollars and the inclusive ticket costs $12 per person. This includes a cable car up to the upper cave, both cave visits (upper and lower), train down to",
          "If you have not yet planned visiting Lebanon you should do so... Jeita Grotto was one of the main reasons for my trip to Lebanon. There are not many words to describe this beauty.",
          "If you haven't been to geita grotto you must do it and fast! Honestly I've been there once while I was a little kid and decided to go back in September to explore it after I heard of the several improvements made there. You will be amazed by the beauty of the Grotto and how",
          "This wasn't the first grotto we have seen or been inside of, but it was by far the most impressive so far. There are 2 caves to explore after the cable car ride to the top. The first one is explored on foot, the second one consists of a boat ride through the cave. Photography",
          "Again, one of the top wonders in the world for a reason. You will walk in and u will stand there in awe! What nature did in there is just out of this world and honestly, words won't do it justice. Btw get a jacket cause it might get cold in there!",
          "I was initially indifferent to this place as I was of the view if you've seen one grotto then you've seen them all. Again it was our tour guide who suggested we should visit it. I was so glad I did, as it was one of best experiences I had in Lebanon. Other grottos pale in",
          "You arrive and transfer by cable car to the entrance of the grotto, unfortunately they do not allow you to take pictures inside. Once inside, the walkway provides an easy climb to the top. On the way the magic of the formation of the stalactites in different shapes and sizes",
          "Jitta, Geita of Jeita it is all the same, but these caves are something, not to compare with the Grottes de Han in Belgium for instance. These here in Lebanon are the biggest I have ever seen. A pity that you are not allowed to take pictures.",
          "This place was an experience. You CAN'T take pictures inside, they lock your phones and camera's in a safe before you enter. This makes you want to take in as much as possible and just marvel at nature's beauty. This cave is impressive and has two levels which are both as",
          "We went here on a weekend and it was surprisingly quite. The caves are incredible and our daughter loved the experience and looking at the formations. A definately must if you want to get out of Beirut.",
          "You lose words when you are in the middle of natures wonders carved by water and time (millions of years). The walkway in the upper cave take you inside a cathedral of beautifully carved stalactites and stalagmites of various shapes and sizes. Every visit you joyfully discover",
          "Spectacular caves and underground river system. Very walk-able path through the caves which is well lit. Unfortunately no pictures allowed inside and you must leave your belongings in a locker before you enter. Plenty of covered parking and a tram system takes you right up",
          "I wasn't expecting anything like this. You walk and walk and walk inside the cave and come back, and then you can get a boat to see it from the bottom. Very well organised. You can't take your camera in with you, they give you a locker. So I haven't got any photos. I can't find",
          "There are two areas. Upper tunnel is to walk through first - take as long or as short a time as you want. Then go out and to the right, take the \"train\" and then to the lower cave for a boat ride. The boat ride is very beautiful but quite short. Recommended.",
          "Just as Petra is to Jordan , Jeita Groto is to Lebanon. We will not waste our efforts describing the beauty of this natural attraction. Cameras are not allowed inside- so there are not too many photos in circulation - hence we would classify it as a not to miss location. The",

          "If you like to visit places with a natural environment, Jeita is the destination. The Place is Clean, organized, well maintained. but taking photos is not allowed, don't know the reason.if because of the camera flash, they installed inside the cave many many projectors which",
          "This is by far the best caves I have ever visited. They are very well preserved and have some stunning formations.",
          "If you go to Beirut this should be a must on your to do list. Hire a local tour company and have them drive you to this amazing natural wonder! They do not let you bring cameras or phones into the caves but there is a storage unit for free to put these in with a lock. Clearly",
          "I have visited grottos with stalagmites and stalactites all over the world and can honestly say that these are by far the best I have seen. You can't imagine how all this was formed one drop of water at a time. Completely mind blowing. The environment is damp and humid so watch",
          "This was the most amazing place to visit. It was beautiful. No camera allowed but the architecture was amazing and the caves and water fabulous. A must see",
          "Must visit. Start with the upper grotto first to truly admire the lower one. Also, instead of taking the cable car, you can take the scenic walk to the grottos ( the lower and the upper ), its around a 7 minute walk.",

          "Jeita grotto has upper and lower grottos. The upper one is huge and has very big shape aged thousands of year. While the lower part has water and it is only discovered by small boat. For sure it worth visiting and enjoying this nature wonder.",

          "That sounds rather bad, but I'd never heard of this place and it is huge and beautiful inside. It's very well maintained with good paths and lots of people around to make sure folks follow the rules. The short boat ride on the bottom was also very cool and made you realize how",
          "This is a wonder of nature and a must see when visiting Lebanon. It's a bit far from Beirut but a good place to visit on a hot summer day. Too bad we can't take photographs (even without flash).",
          "The location of the grotto, the cave, it's on a beautiful green forested mountain. The upper cave is magnificent! I had never seen such a scene: full of stalactites and stalagmites meters high, with a whitish color, still dripping water and forming. I wouldn't be surprised if",

          "It would be silly to miss this. Unless you are a speciality in caves, etc. you will find this interesting. 1.5 hour max. Upper Grotto has some serious steps (at least for me), so do not come with high heels. The Lower Grotto is a welcome relief from the tiring efforts of the",
          "Well worth a visit. Start at the upper cavern which is amazing then take the little train to the lower cavern. You take a boat here. Wear sensible shoes as some areas are wet and can be slippery. No photos are allowed and you are asked to secure cameras phones in a locker.",
          "Just a marvel... My kids and we were amazed in looking at this huge cave in the heart of the mountain.. the place is also too close to Beirut city centre...a Must do place...give lot of fun and also creative ideas for the kids",

          "Both the Upper and Lower Grotto are spectacular, but the Upper Grotto was beyond my imagination. Seemed so out of the world. Searching on the internet never gave a real picture of the majestic place and taking pictures were not allowed! But the experience will be staying with me",
          "probably the most beautiful grotto in Lebanon and the middle east. its another world there! very recommended for tourists.",

          "The Jeita Grotto is a must see attraction in central Lebanon, just North of Beirut. The drive was short from our hotel in Beirut. The Jeita Grotto is very well organized catering to large groups as well as smaller family units. You enter and pay a small parking charge and we",
          "What an amazing place to see. Take the time spend a little extra and uber out there. Worth the 12$ admission fee for a life long memory! Pictures can't describe what you see and the boat ride was a great way to end our cave experience!! Go go go",
          "I like it everything in this trip, I highly recommend every visitor to visit Jeita Grotto, you will see the creativity in the upper and lower Grotto. The trip In the upper Grotto will take approximately 45 minutes on feets, while in the lower Grotto will take 10 minutes by boat.",

          "Beautiful caves on different levels. You explore the higher cave by foot - about a 400m round-trip and the bottom by boat, the boat trip lasts about 10 mins. You are expected to lock your phones away before entering each cave but many didn't! Definitely worth a visit if you are",

          "You don't need a tour guide to go there. rent a car ( will come in handy for your Lebanon trip). Use a big 16cc car as small cars doesn't really run best on mountain roads. download offline maps for Lebanon ( in Google maps application). Now you are ready to go. it takes around",

          "What a nice and beautiful place to visit. The top portion is really nice and interesting, but the bottom part with the water and boat is just amazing. It is worth visiting.",
          "We visited jeita caves in January, it is amazing place with 2 different places. The biggest cave is about 30 meters height full of colors, shapes and the other you can take a boat trip inside the 2nd. Cave you should take care of your head as its hights very low especially if",
          "One of the biggest and beautiful caves in middle east. Go to the upper caves by cable ride and walk in the caves. Come to lower grotto by toy train and a boat ride in the lower caves. Beautiful views make you wonder how it got created.",
          "Very nice tourist attraction but you have to be good on foot -- very close and easily accessible from Beirut",
          "Very nice place to visit and admire the natural beauty. One thing that is disappointing is that it is not allowed to take photos inside the caves. I understand that flash may have an effect but regular photo taking will do no harm. Many visitors do not respect this rule anyway",
          "I have visited various grottos in different parts of the world, but I have never seen such an extensive grotto covered with so many interesting formations. Apparently the cavern stretches for some 6 km into the mountain. There are an upper and lower cavern. In the upper cavern",
          "One of the most fascinating and intriguing places to visit. It's accessible from Beirut but so much easier to go with Nakhal Tours in Beirut. The tour guides have a wealth of information too.",
          "First of all, the entrance ticket is. Bit expensive, it was 25$ and there is no public transportation to get you there, but it is worth the money. First of all the grotto is 2 levels, Iberia and lower: The lower one you will do it via boat and it's colder there ...way colder.",
          "We thought this was an absolutely amazing set of caves The cable car up to the top is safe and a bit of fun. You can walk through the top caves at your leisure. You then get a tractor and trailer ride down to the bottom caves and board a boat for a trip through the caves",

          "Jeita grotto shows the raw capabilities of nature on a grand scale and is another must visit when in Lebanon. Those of a geographic/nature disposition will particularly enjoy the site as it shows the development of staligtites and stalagmites",
          "It's really a must visit city-seen. It's the nature real wonder to see just Grotto which shaped by nature and feel God's miracle there to let dripping water shaping the stones like smooth layers, curtains and ice cream cones. The best part is the lower Grotto which requires boat",
          "This is an amazing grotto, actually two grottos. The first is larger and dry with capricious formations. The second lower grotto is smaller and you navigate it in a small boat. Definitely the highlight of our trip so far.",
          "These caves are the most visited tourist site in the country, and after a late Friday visit here I can easily see why. The grottos were my last stop on a day that took me north to Byblos and up to Harissa (see separate reviews), fittingly providing a coda for the week before I",
          "This cave complex consists of two main caverns. The upper level is amazing, huge with well organized walkways. The second is only accessable by boat and gives you this out of this world experience. A must see for any visitor to Lebanon",

          "It's such a shame you can't take photos of either the upper or lower grotto! There is no reason as to why, you will be made to put your cameras in a locker before you enter. Once inside though, it's unbelievably cool! Both grottos are immense, but I enjoyed the boat ride in the",
          "These wonders of nature are a must-see! On a Saturday morning with very little traffic we arrived here in 30 minutes from Beirut centrum. We used 1.5 hours to see both caves but mind you, there were no queues at all. You must pay in cash for the entrance tickets. Visit these",
          "The kids had so much fun looking at the stalactites and stalagmites. This was definitely one of their favor sites in Lebanon (after MundoKids). The site features a cable car (not necessary, you can walk up to the upper cave), a fun train ride, and a mini-zoo (featuring bunnies,",
          "A true gem hidden between the mountain of Lebanon, 30 min away from Beirut and 15 min away from Jounieh, no public transportation. a 2-3 hours visit if fair enough to see the magnificent Grotto, incredible landscape. You will get the the big Grotto by cable car and you will",
          "This place is the most beautiful of God creations that I have ever seen. No photos can do this place any justice. You have to see it with your own eyes. Few things to follow: Take the telefreak to the upper cave. Inside the cave, watch out for the very slippery narrow walkway",

          "This is the most incredible and beautiful cave which I have ever seen in my life. it is really a must to do in Lebanon and do not miss this place. If you are lucky and you visit in a time which the water level is not high, then you would have the chance to both caves. if the",
          "You will feel like you are in another world. The grotto is amazing, something you can't imagine. We went on a rainy day, the lower cave was closed. The site in general is very well taken care of. We had a great time.",
          "Unique and beautiful grottes. It is a must to visite them. Avoid pick hours. Although is a bit touristy, it is interesting to visite.",
          "Having never been in to a cave system before, this was a new experience and I suddenly understand the feeling of wonder that cavers feel and takes them back to these extraordinary places. The short cable car (Telepherique) ride to the top level set the scene and then you wander",

          "If you are in Beirut, you must visit this natural wonder. One must see in order to believe that nature could produce such a place. Actually, I thought I was on an alien movie set \ud83d\ude0a",

          "I believe that I wasted a huge time on this dull, scary and creepy place. Not recommended for people with claustrophobia and color loving ones. The two stars were given to the personnel, the cable car and the vintage bus.",

          "Okay so with some extensive travel under my belt and lots of Grotto's and caves included I can truly say the best you'll see from my experience is the Jeita Grotto in Beirut Lebanon. The expanse, age, and pristine detail in this Grotto is astounding. As with most Grotto's you",
          "I went to this attraction with some fairly low expectations, but it is a fantastic attractions. Especially the upper grotto is absolutely huge, with some amazing stalactites and stalacmites. Just take the very short cable car uphill or walk uphill to get these. The lower grotto",
          "What an amazing jewel Lebanon has - Jeita Grotto is truly stunning and a must when visiting this beautiful country. Its worth getting to this attraction early as this place must get exceptionally busy. We arrived just after it opened so didn't have to queue. Words cannot",
          "Breathtaking cave. The upper section is about a half-hour hike; the lower section at ten-minute boat ride. A few steps in the upper vault, but nothing onerus. Much recommended.",
          "This cave is truly stupendous. Some of the largest stalactites in the world in a well-lit and well-maintained cave pathway. Take a cable-car to the top. The lower grotto has a small boat ride and is also beautiful. Only problem is trash at the bottom of the gorge on the way",

          "Having been lucky enough to see a number of different caves in various countries it must be said these two caves are in the top three. The top grotto was breathtaking in size, condition and the number of formations. We were fortunate enough to be able to enter the lower grotto",

It is the city's oldest extant church: it has been built over the disappeared Anastasi Romano-Byzantine Cathedral.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe establishment of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Beirut is attributed according to the Greek Orthodox tradition to the Apostle Quartus of Berytus, one of the Seventy disciples, who served as Beirut's first bishop. Byzantine emperor Theodosius II issued a decree c.\u2009449 \u2013 c.\u2009450 AD elevating the bishop of Beirut Efstathius to the rank of Metropolitan bishop. The city was until then a diocese of the Metropolis of Tyre.The Anastasis cathedral was the first church to be built on the site of the Saint George cathedral. It was built by Efstathuis in the fifth century AD and bordered the auditoria of Beirut's Roman law school. The church influenced the teachings of the school as law scholars worked to reconcile the texts of Roman law and the teachings of Christianity as attested by Severus of Antioch, who visited the city in the fifth century AD.In 551 AD a massive earthquake destroyed the whole of Beirut including the \"Anastasis cathedral\". In the 12th century a cathedral was built in the same location. The structure was badly damaged by a 1759 earthquake and was pulled down to be built anew. Construction started in 1764 and the new, larger structure, with one nave and a vaulted ceiling, was completed in 1767. However, the ceiling collapsed killing 90 people, due to the lack of supporting pillars. In 1772 the church was rebuilt on a cruciform plan with three naves, a new portico was added to the north facade, the main western facade was enlarged and a new bell-tower was built on the north-western corner.In 1783 the cathedral underwent a series of modifications, including the addition of the narthex to the western facade and the enlargement of the apse to fit the central axis of the cathedral's main altar. That same year Younes al-Jbeily offered the church its ornate gilded wooden iconostasis.The last modifications to the cathedral were made in 1910, with the addition of a vaulted portico to the south facade, the cathedral was further enlarged to the east and the bell tower was moved to the south-east corner. The interior of the cathedral was decorated with ornate frescoes offered by Ibrahim Youssef Saad.In 1975, following the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war, the cathedral was shelled and vandalized and its elaborate frescoes were left to decay. Most of the icons and part of the iconostasis were stolen; parts of the 18th century iconsostasis were also set on fire. The excavations undertaken under the cathedral during 17 months in 1994\u20131995 covered 316 square metres (3,400 sq ft) and revealed many archaeological layers that allowed a historical timeline of the church and its surroundings to be constructed. On 10 October 1995 Metropolitan Elias Audi announced plans to restore the war-torn cathedral. The first phase of restoration began in 1998, under the supervision of a committee headed by Ghassan Tueni. The cathedral reopened its doors on 15 December 2003.\n\n\n== The archaeological crypt museum ==\n\nIn 1994, archaeological excavations undertaken within and in the vicinity of the Saint George cathedral before the initiation of restoration works unveiled a number of artifacts and vestiges spanning the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Medieval and Ottoman eras. The aim of the excavation was to locate the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral in relation to the standing cathedral and ultimately triangulate the location of the ancient Law School of Beirut. The excavations also revealed the sequence of continuous religious use of the site. A committee was formed under the patronage of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Beirut to oversee the excavations and the creation of the Saint George archaeological crypt museum. The founding committee was headed by archaeologist Leila Bader who served as the director of the American University of Beirut Archaeological Museum and included Nabil Azar, Yasmine Macaron Bou Assaf, Katia Neeman Salha and Rita Kalindjian. The creation of the museum was funded by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Beirut with a donation from the Jacques and Naila Saad\u00e9 foundation. The museum was inaugurated on 3 December 2011.The museum consists of a crypt running under a part of the cathedral where visitors walk through 12 stops showcasing the different archaeological and historical layers. The museum has a surface area of 250 square metres (2,700 sq ft), it is accessible through a breach in the cathedral's foundation wall and a stairwell built in front of the church's northern side. Towards the end of the circuit, the crypt opens up to a glass partition giving views to the cathedral's altar.The display includes a number of finds such as oil lamps, smoking pipes, pottery, statuettes and Christian vessels and ornaments. Other vestiges kept in-situ include parts of the older churches' altars and apse, mosaics, stone engravings, tombstones and columns, some of which belong to the old city's Cardo maximus.The excavated area also includes a necropolis where 25 burials were opened. The tombs were oriented on an east-west axis, with the head facing west. These graves consisted of a single sandstone course overlaid by large stone slabs. A large quantity of iron nails were uncovered in the necropolis suggesting the use of wooden coffins in the funeral customs. Among the uncovered tombs was a one containing the skeleton of a man wearing a bronze tiara, with an iron arrowhead and three bronze amulets placed over his chest.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeirut Central District\nEastern Orthodox Church\nEastern Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon\nChristianity in Lebanon\nSaint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut\nSayyidat al-Nouriyyeh\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Horsh Beirut (Arabic: \u062d\u0631\u0634 \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a) is an urban park in the heart of the capital of Lebanon, Beirut. The urban park is also known as Horsh El Snaubar (Arabic: \u062d\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0646\u0648\u0628\u0631 or French: Bois de Pins), the green space that serves as an oxygen for the lungs of Beirut.\nThe park covers about 300,000 m\u00b2 of green space within municipal Beirut\n.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 13th century, William of Tyre (or Latin: Willelmus Tyrensis), the medieval prelate, chronicler and the archbishop of Tyre, named the forest of Beirut, as \"La Pin\u00e9e\" or \"Sapinoie\". The park, Horsh, has suffered throughout history from frequent abuse of its timber especially by the armies of the Crusaders, Mamluks, Ottomans, and the Allies of World War II to build ships and weapons. Large parts of the pine forest were segmented-out to become an Ottoman Casino in 1917 (which became the Pine Residence later during the French Mandate of Lebanon), a horse racecourse in 1921, Al-Shohadaa Cemetery in 1958, and Rawdat al-Shaheedein Cemetery in the 1970s. Moreover, the development of new roads during the 1950s state planning produced some leftovers of the remaining woodland that became subject to conflict and appropriation.\nDuring recent history, Horsh was bombed to burn by Israeli jet fighters during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Much of it was also turned into a Palestinian refugee camp. From a pine forest over 1,250,000 m2 in 1696 it decreased to a park over 800,000 m2 in 1967 (\u2248 5% of Municipal Beirut), Today, the park is 300,000 m2 large triangular park at the southern border of the city limited by Omar Beyhum Street, 22 November Avenue, Abdelnasser Avenue and National Museum of Beirut (Mus\u00e9e national de Beyrouth).It lies along the axis of the old airport road amidst areas of Mazraa, Tarik el-Jdideh, Qasqas, Sabra, Ghobeyri, Shiyah, Furn el-Shebak, and Badaro while it is separated from Ras el-Nabaa by the Beirut Hippodrome.\nThe park, or Horsh Beirut, has been reconstructed after the end of the Lebanese Civil War and it has been closed for the general public for about 25 years. Lebanese citizens had to apply for a permission and only have chances to get one if they are older than 35 years. At the same time there have been reports of Western foreigners getting permission while applications by Lebanese were rejected. Beirut residents have repeatedly protested against the denial of access to the park including the unequal access policies for Western and non-Western park visitors. However, it ended up being reopened to the public by the governor of Beirut, Ziad Chebib, on September 3, 2015, in what was considered a victory for civil society after constantly demanding its reopening to all Lebanese citizens.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAl-Wali, T.

        "wiki": "Beirut ( bay-ROOT; Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e, romanized: Bayr\u016bt; French: Beyrouth, pronounced [b\u025b\u0281ut]) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. No recent population census has been conducted, but 2007 estimates ranged from slightly more than 1 million to 2.2 million as part of Greater Beirut, which makes it the third-largest city in the Levant region and the fifteenth-largest in the Arab world. Located on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast, Beirut is an important regional seaport.\nIt is one of the oldest cities in the world, having been inhabited for more than 5,000 years.  The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the Amarna letters from the New Kingdom of Egypt, which date to the 15th century BC.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with most banks and corporations based in its Central District, Badaro, Rue Verdun, Hamra, Ryad el Soleh street, and Achrafieh. Following the destructive Lebanese Civil War, Beirut's cultural landscape underwent major reconstruction. Identified and graded for accountancy, advertising, banking, finance and law, Beirut is ranked as a Beta World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayr\u016bt (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French occupation. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician Berot or Birut (\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd15\u200e Brt). This was a modification of the Canaanite and Phoenician word be'rot, meaning \"the wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The etymology is shared by the biblical Beeroth (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea) which was, however, a different settlement somewhere near Jerusalem. The name is first attested in the 15th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.The Greeks hellenised the name as B\u0113ryt\u00f3s (Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nBefore, under the Seleucid Empire, the city had been already founded and known as Laodicea in honour of the mother of Seleucus the Great. It was distinguished from several other places named in her honour by the longer names Laodicea in Phoenicia (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u1fc3, romanized: Laod\u00edkeia h\u0113 en Phoin\u00edk\u0113i) or Laodicea in Canaan (Phoenician: \ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd03\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd00 \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd14 \ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd0d, romanized: Ll\u02bedk\u02be \u02be\u0161 bkn\u02bfn).\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nBeirut was settled more than 5,000 years ago and the area had been inhabited for far longer. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Fran\u00e7ais in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.Beirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.Beirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticised by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area.Beirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.Beirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.Beirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement was on an easily defended island in the river that, however, progressively silted up and joined it to the mainland. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, and Ottoman remains.\n\n\n=== Phoenician period ===\n\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorisation was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\n\n=== Hellenistic period ===\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon in his contest with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the end of the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of this Hellenistic period. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control, however after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, veteran soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken.Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions. Consequently, the city quickly became fully Romanized: it was one of four Roman colonies (coloniae) in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation.\nIts territory under Claudius reached the Bekaa valley and included Heliopolis (Baalbek): it was the only mostly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia region, because it was settled by Roman colonists who even promoted agriculture in the fertile lands around Yammoune. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony. Its law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught there under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire. After the 551 Beirut earthquake the students were transferred to Sidon.The post-war salvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. Prince Arslan bin al-Mundhir founded the Principality of Sin el Fil in Beirut in 759. From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon, which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon, today's Lebanon. As a trading centre of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was overshadowed by Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197.  John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204.  He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512\u20131520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks.\nAfter Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\n\n==== Vilayet of Beirut ====\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Dr. Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\nThese families are:\n\nAll other families of Beirut are considered to have descended from one of those seven main branches, such as Nahhas, Yanout Inkidar, Hajjal, Hamza and others who derived from the Sinno Family (p. 14).\nSinno is considered to be an old family in Beirut, descending from the Muslim Leader Tareq Bin Ziyad.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Capital of Lebanon ====\n\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975\u20131976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city has somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has been host to the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960\u20131964, 1999, 2001\u20132002.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.In the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) characterised by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, winter is mild and rainy. Summer is hot and can be virtually rainless and very dry although it can get very muggy, especially in August. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October - April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public garden ( sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact concrete roofs cover 80% Of the capital area.\n\n\n=== Quarters and sectors ===\n\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikha\u00ebl)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRemeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-BlatThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs.Badaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favourite hip nightlife destination.Two of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more common.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. The city boasts significant Muslim and Christian communities. In Beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups. At the end of the civil war the Copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. The original seventeen included four Muslim sects: Shi'a, Sunni, 'Alawi, and Druze; Twelve Christian sects: Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholics, Protestant Evangelicals, and other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, Assyrians (Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic), Copts; and Jews (very few remain in Lebanon today, but children of Lebanese Jewish parents may register as citizens at Lebanese Embassies.) Briefly, Christians are 52% of Beirut, Muslims 47%, and 1% others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognised by Lebanese civil authorities.\nBefore the civil war the neighbourhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict.  East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. The southern suburbs are populated largely by Shia Muslims, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian.\nThe city is also home to a small number of Latin Rite Roman Catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with Archbishop Paul Dahdah, OCD, as the apostolic vicar.\n\n\n== Beirut Central District ==\n\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country.\" It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, F\u00eate de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticised for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down  \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.Finally, the actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. With its seaport and airport\u2014coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates\u2014Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban, Lebanon's central bank, the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\n\n=== Banking and finance ===\n\nThe Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East,\" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).The largely pedestrianised Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-fa\u00e7ade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouch\u00e9, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouch\u00e9 Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighbourhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighbourhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighbourhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming caf\u00e9 and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.  There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath caf\u00e9s of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.Hamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighbouring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic Bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighbourhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colourful and chic caf\u00e9s amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totalling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.Many of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighbouring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organised, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialised procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International organisations ===\nThe city is home to numerous international organisations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes.\nThe American University of Beirut and Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph (USJ), are the oldest respectively English medium and French medium universities in the country.\nThe Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to the Lebanese American University (LAU), which is also, together with many of its programs, accredited by US bodies and considered lately one of the top universities in the Middle East. Beirut is also home to the American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), as well as the Notre Dame University \u2013 Louaize (NDU), Universit\u00e9 La Sagesse (ULS).\nNotre Dame University (NDU)'s degrees are becoming more and more valuable with time. NDU received its accreditation from NIASC in 2015.\nThe Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing the university colleges, university institutes and universities in Beirut and nationwide.Among the private secondary schools in Beirut are, College Saint Joseph Antoura, Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais, Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame de Jamhour, College Melkart, Carmel Saint-Joseph, Coll\u00e8ge Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Nazareth, Coll\u00e8ge du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Gemmayz\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge Protestant Fran\u00e7ais, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by ferry from Cyprus via the nearby city of Jounieh or by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC \u2013 \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.The ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.Beirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilisations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading centre of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.Beirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighbouring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.Planet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.In October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels\u2014priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a pterodactyl is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" \u2013 an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish\u2019n\u2019Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of M\u00e9moire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life \u2013 a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year. According to a 2010 study by the American global consulting firm Mercer comparing high-end items such as upscale residential areas and entertainment venues, Beirut was ranked as the 4th most expensive city in the Middle East and 15th among the Upper Middle Income Countries included in the survey.

        "wiki": "The American University of Beirut (AUB) (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e) is a private, non-sectarian, and independent university chartered in New York with campus in Beirut, Lebanon. AUB was ranked the top university in the Arab region in the 2018 QS World University Rankings.AUB is governed by a private, autonomous Board of Trustees and offers programs leading to bachelor's, master's, MD and PhD degrees.\nAUB has an operating budget of $423 million with an endowment of approximately $768 million. The campus is composed of 64 buildings, including the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC, formerly known as AUH \u2013 American University Hospital) (420 beds), four libraries, three museums and seven dormitories. Almost one-fifth of AUB's students attended secondary school or university outside Lebanon before coming to AUB. AUB graduates reside in more than 120 countries worldwide. The language of instruction is English. Degrees awarded at the university are officially registered with the New York Board of Regents.\nOn May 5, 2020, AUB's President Fadlo Khuri announced a projected 60% decline in AUB's revenue in the next academic year and added that furloughs, layoffs, and the elimination of departments and programs will be necessary for financial survival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn January 23, 1862, W. M. Thomson proposed to a meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions that a college of higher learning, that would include medical training, should be established in Beirut with Dr. Daniel Bliss as its president. On April 24, 1863, while Bliss was raising money for the new college in the United States and England, the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College. The college, which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920, opened with a class of 16 students on December 3, 1866. Bliss served as its first president, from 1866 until 1902. In the beginning Arabic was used as the language of instruction because it was the common language of the ethnic groups of the region, and prospective students needed to be fluent in Ottoman Turkish or in French as well as in English. In 1887 the language of instruction became English.\n\nAUB alumni have had a broad and significant impact on the region and the world for many years. For example, 19 AUB alumni were delegates to the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945\u2014more than any other university in the world. AUB graduates continue to serve in leadership positions as presidents of their countries, prime ministers, members of parliament, ambassadors, governors of central banks, presidents and deans of colleges and universities, academics, businesspeople, scientists, engineers, doctors, teachers, and nurses. They work in governments, the private sector, and in nongovernmental organizations.\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War (1975\u20131990) AUB pursued various means to preserve the continuity of studies, including enrollment agreements with universities in the United States.  On January 18, 1984, AUB President Malcolm H. Kerr was murdered outside his office by members of Islamic Jihad, which preceded the Hezbollah. In 1982 Acting President David S. Dodge was kidnapped on campus by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim extremists. In 1984 and 1985 a number of university staff were kidnapped, including electrical engineering professor Frank Regier, professor J. Leigh Douglas, professor Philip Padfield, professor Joseph Cicippio, dean of the faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences Thomas Sutherland (held captive from 1985 to 1991), director David Jacobsen, and librarian Peter Kilburn (killed by his captors). In all, 30 university-connected people were kidnapped during the war.In November 1991, a bomb believed to have been set off by pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalists demolished the main building of the American University of Beirut, injuring four people, on the 125th anniversary of the school's founding.On March 21, 2008, the Board of Trustees selected Peter Dorman to be AUB's 15th president. He succeeded John Waterbury who was president of AUB from 1998 to 2008. Dorman is a scholar in the field of Egyptology and formerly chaired the University of Chicago's Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.\nOn March 19, 2015, the Board of Trustees formally approved the nomination of Fadlo R. Khuri, MD, as the next president. He was inaugurated as AUB's 16th president on January 25, 2016.After initially announcing that it would stay open in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ignoring the Lebanese Ministry of Education and Higher Education's request that it shut down, in early March 2020 the university announced that it would close down.\n\n\n== University presidents ==\nThe list of University presidents since its establishment:\nDaniel Bliss (1866\u20131902)\nHoward S.

Khuri (September 2015\u2013Present)\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nThe 61-acre (250,000 m2) American University of Beirut campus is on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea on one side and bordering Bliss Street on the other. AUB's campus in Ras Beirut consists of 64 buildings, seven dormitories and several libraries. In addition, the university also houses the Charles W. Hostler Student Center, an Archaeological Museum as well as the widely renowned Natural History Museum. Students also have a range of recreational and research facilities, such as the 247 acre research farm and educational complex hosted by the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences' AREC (Advancing Research Enabling Communities Center) in Beqaa, Lebanon.\n\n\n== Faculties ==\nFAFS, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences\nFAS, Faculty of Arts and Sciences\nFHS, Faculty of Health Sciences\nFM, Faculty of Medicine\nHSON, Rafic Hariri School of Nursing\nMSFEA, Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture\nOSB, Suliman S. Olayan School of Business\n\n\n== Students ==\nIn fall 2018, there were over 9,000 students enrolled at AUB: 7,180 undergraduates and 1,922 graduate students.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAUB offers 141 undergraduate/graduate programs and 36 certificates and diplomas.\nIn 2007, the American University of Beirut reintroduced PhD programs. Currently, it offers doctoral programs in the following fields:\nArab and Middle Eastern History\nArabic Language and Literature\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomedical Sciences\nCell and Molecular Biology\nCivil Engineering\nElectrical and Computer Engineering\nEnvironmental and Water Resources Engineering\nEpidemiology\nMechanical Engineering\nNursing\nTheoretical Physics\nAUB also includes dozens of research centers and institute that sponsor and promote research in a variety of fields.\n\n\n== Medical Center ==\nThe AUB Medical Center (AUBMC) is the private, not-for-profit teaching center of the Faculty of Medicine. AUBMC, which is accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCIA) on hospital accreditation, includes a 420-bed hospital and offers comprehensive tertiary/quaternary medical care and referral services in a wide range of specialties and medical, nursing, and paramedical training programs at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels.\nThroughout its history, the AUB Medical Center, which was formerly known as the American University Hospital (AUH), has played a critical role in caring for the victims of regional and local conflicts. It provided care for the sick and wounded during World War I and World War II, the Lebanese Civil War, the Palestinian conflict, and the invasion of Iraq. In recent years, it has provided care for a number of Syrian refugees at the Medical Center in Beirut, at partner hospitals, and at mobile clinics.Since 1905, AUB's medical services have included a nursing school. In 2008, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) invited AUB's Rafic Hariri School of Nursing to become a full member, making it the first member of the AACN outside the United States. The American Nurses Credentialing Center's (ANCC) Magnet Recognition Program awarded AUBMC its prestigious Magnet designation on June 23, 2009. AUBMC is the first healthcare institution in the Middle East and the third in the world outside the United States to receive this award.On April 4, 2011, AUB announced the AUBMC 2020 Vision, which includes the construction of a state-of-the-art medical complex consisting of 12 buildings that would increase bed capacity to almost 600. In his inaugural address in January 2016, AUB President Fadlo R. Khuri, MD, outlined Health 2025 affirming the University's commitment to be the regional leader and a key global partner in addressing global health challenges.\nAUBMC now includes the Rafic Hariri School of Nursing Building, the Pierre Abu Khater Outpatient Building, the Wassef and Souad Sawwaf Building, the Medical Administration Building, the Halim and Aida Daniel Academic and Clinical Center, and the Inpatient and Outpatient hospital buildings.\nThe University is also home to several Clinical and Research Centers of Excellence such as the Mamdouha El-Sayed Bobst Breast Unit, the Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute, the Abu-Haidar Neuroscience Institute, the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon (affiliated with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee), the Moufid Farra Heart and Vascular Outpatient Center, the Nehme and Therese Tohme Multiple Sclerosis Center, and the Ahmad and Jamila Bizri Neuro Outpatient Center. They address health issues endemic to the Arab region such as cancer, heart and vascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, blood disorders, and mental illness.\nAs part of the AUBMC 2020 vision, AUBMC held a groundbreaking ceremony for its New Medical Center Expansion Under the Patronage of HE President Michel Aoun in May 2019.\n\n\n== University museums and collections ==\nThere are three museums at AUB: the Archaeological Museum, the Geology Museum, and the Natural History Museum.\nThe Archaeological Museum is the third oldest museum in the Near East. Its collection includes more than 16,000 objects and 10,000 coins and features pottery, prehistoric flint tools, bronze figurines, Phoenician and classical sculptures and bas-reliefs, Egyptian alabaster vases from Byblos, hairpins, and musical instruments. The museum has conducted excavations in Lebanon and Syria. The Society of the Friends of the AUB Museum organizes lectures, exhibits, and activities for children.The Geology Museum includes rocks, minerals, and fossils from around the world. It is an important resource for AUB students and researchers and for students from other universities and schools in Lebanon.\nThe Natural History Museum houses a unique collection that represents the biodiversity of the area. It is especially well known for the Post Herbarium, which includes 63,000 specimens.AUB's Archives and Special Collections includes important documents related to the founding of the Syrian Protestant College in 1866 and also many materials (documents, maps, photographs, etc.) of interest to scholars of Lebanon and the region including the Beirut Codex, a New Testament in Syriac, dating back to the 9th or 10th century; the E. W. Blatchford Collection (photographs of the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa taken between 1880 and 1900); and political and cultural posters dating back to the 1940s.The American University of Beirut has embarked upon a new initiative (AUB Art Galleries and Collections) to play an active role in promoting fine and contemporary art in the region.\nThe very first step taken in this new direction coincided with the generous donation of Dr. Samir Saleeby to AUB. The Rose and Shaheen Saleeby Collection includes paintings by artists of different generations, ranging from Khalil Saleeby (1870-1928) and Cesar Gemayal (1898-1958) to Omar Onsi (1901-1969) and Saliba Douaihy (1912-1994). It also features works by Haidar Hamaoui (b. 1937), Chucrallah Fattouh (b. 1956), and Robert Khoury (b. 1923). The Saleeby donation is the cornerstone upon which AUB will establish a comprehensive collection of modern and contemporary art from the region.\nThe new initiative commenced with the launching of new art spaces located in and around AUB campus: the Rose and Shaheen Saleeby Museum in Sidani Street and the Byblos Bank Art Gallery, in Ada Dodge Hall (on campus).\n\n\n== Libraries ==\n\n\n=== University Libraries ===\nThe university libraries include:\n\nNami Jafet Memorial Library\nEngineering and Architecture Library\nSaab Medical Library serves the AUB Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, the Rafic Hariri School of Nursing, in addition to the entire AUB campus.\nScience and Agriculture Library.The Agricultural Research and Education Center (AREC) in the Beqaa Valley also includes an annex to the Science and Agriculture Library.\nThe University Libraries are home to a rich collection that consists of:\n\nPrint titles: 412,775 (books); 5,776 (periodicals)\nPrint volumes: 505,548 (books); 162,727 (periodicals)\nElectronic titles (including open access): 1,098,491 (books); 138,430 (periodicals)\nDatabases (paid subscriptions): 262\nPrint books purchased/added: 7,243 titles / 8,380 volumes\nGift/Exchange books added: 4,136 titles / 5,048 volumes\nManuscripts: 1,373 titles / 1,408 volumes\nMaps: 1,684 titles / 2,027 volumes\nUniversity archives: 940 linear feet / 2,720 archival boxes\nMicroform items: 11,487 titles / 33,265 volumes\nFilm and video titles: 3,544 titles / 4,629 volumes\nAudio recordings: 456 titles / 740 volumesAlthough many library resources are accessible remotely from on and off campus, the libraries themselves are equipped with e-classrooms, computer labs, and wireless connectivity. Trained and experienced library staff conduct classes and workshops throughout the year to introduce and train users to take advantage of the libraries' collections, information resources, and innovative technologies.\n\n\n== AUB Press ==\nThe American University of Beirut (AUB) has been publishing since its inception as the Syrian Protestant College (SPC). The earliest publication held in AUB's Nami Jafet Memorial Library was published in 1881; a study in Arabic on the management of disease, written by Dr. John Wortabet, professor of Anatomy and Physiology in the medical school of the Syrian Protestant College.At the time, the SPC had no university press nor a centralized publication office. The earliest publications of the college were published in the name of the college by the American Mission Press, which was founded in Malta in 1822, moved to Beirut in 1832, and operated until 1965. Other publishers produced books for AUB, including the Franciscan Press in Jerusalem and the Catholic Press in Beirut.\nIn 1969, a formal centralized publications office was created, the Office of Publications. By 2001, a decision was made to publish books in the name of the AUB Press rather than the more general American University of Beirut name. In 2004, organizational changes at AUB resulted in the split of the Office of University Publications into two separate offices. The Office of University Publications, which became the Office of Communications, came under the jurisdiction of the Office of Development and External Relations while the AUB Press, focused on publishing academic research as books, was placed under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Provost.\n\n\n== Fundraising ==\n\nOn January 16, 2017, AUB President Fadlo R. Khuri announced BOLDLY AUB: The Campaign to Lead, Innovate, and Serve during an event on campus in Beirut, Lebanon. The New York launch was on March 16, 2017. The goals of the five-year $650 million Campaign are to enrich the educational and research experience of students and faculty; serve the healthcare needs of the region; prioritize innovation and entrepreneurship; engage with communities in the region to achieve real impact; and secure the University's long-term sustainability.\nIn January 2017, AUB also announced the largest gift in its history from the Semaan Foundation to name the Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. AUB has received major gifts in support of the BOLDLY AUB Campaign as well from the Dar Group (to design a Medical Center and develop a Campus Master Plan) and from Jamal Daniel and the Levant Foundation for an expansion of the Medical Center.\n\n\n== Accreditation ==\nAUB was granted institutional accreditation in June 2004 by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The University's accreditation was reaffirmed in 2009 and again in 2016 and 2019.In September 2006, the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) accredited the Graduate Public Health Program in the Faculty of Health Sciences (FHS). The program was reaccredited in 2012 for seven years. The AUB Graduate Public Health Program is the first CEPH-accredited public health program outside the North American continent and the only CEPH-accredited public health program in the Arab world, Asia, and Africa.The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accredited AUB's Rafic Hariri School of Nursing's BSN and MSN programs on October 13, 2007. The accreditation was reaffirmed in 2012.In April 2009, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited the Suliman S. Olayan School of Business (OSB). The accreditation was reaffirmed in 2014. AACSB is the leading international accrediting agency for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degree programs in business administration and accounting. Less than five percent of business schools worldwide have earned AACSB International accreditation.The Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at the American University of Beirut received accreditation for its undergraduate BE civil engineering, BE computer and communications engineering, BE in electrical and computer engineering, and BE in mechanical engineering programs from the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) in 2008. The accreditation was reaffirmed in 2016. The undergraduate program in chemical engineering was accredited in 2013.\nThe Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences' undergraduate Nutrition and Dietetics Coordinated Program (NDCP) was accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) in 2013. It was reaccredited in 2017.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nAUB has 64,417 living alumni.

The garden is one of the oldest public open-air spaces in the capital.  Khalil Pasha (1864\u20131923), commander of the Turkish Sixth Army during World War I ordered the creation of the garden in 1907.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe garden has changed names since its construction in the first decade of the 20th century. It was first called The Hamidi Public Garden, but the public for decades referred to it as the Sanayeh Garden.  It was renamed in honor of President Ren\u00e9 Moawad who was assassinated on November 22, 1989 near to the garden.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe garden is bordered from the north by Rue Spears, from the south by Rue Alameddine, from the east by Rue Halawani and from the west by Rue Sanayeh. Facing the garden on Rue Spears is the complex of the National Library. Covering 22,000 square meters, the garden is a popular destination for walkers, joggers and children. The garden is also popular among the elderly who sit in the shade of the trees to play cards, backgammon or chess. The garden is also a place where artists exhibit their work.\n\n\n== During the 2006 War ==\nAfter the 2006 Lebanon War started, the garden and its surrounding became a meeting point for refugees and NGOs. The \"Sanayeh Relief Center\" was located in a house facing the garden.\n\n\n== In literature and theater ==\nDay of Honey: A Memoir of Food, Love, and War by Annia Ciezadlo\"I went to a small public park called Sanayeh Garden with Jackson and our friend Abdulrahman, who was going around who was going around Ras Beirut buying food and medicine for refugees with his own money.\"\"The only people handling the refugee crisis in Sanayeh Garden were a handful of students in their teens and twenties, one of them wearing the splint and bandage of a recent nose job.\"Jnaynet Al-Sanaye' (Sanayeh Garden) a play by Roger Assaf (1997)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Luna Park is a name shared by dozens of currently operating and defunct amusement parks. They are named after, and partly based on, the first Luna Park, which opened in 1903 during the heyday of large Coney Island parks. Luna parks are considered as small-scale attraction parks, easily accessed, potentially addressed to the permanent or temporary residential market, and located in the suburbs or even near the town center. Luna parks mainly offer classic funfair attractions (great wheel), newer features (electronic displays) and catering services.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Luna Park on Coney Island, a massive spectacle of rides, ornate towers and cupolas covered in 250,000 electric lights, was opened in 1903 by the showmen and entrepreneurs Frederic Thompson and Elmer \"Skip\" Dundy. The park was either named after the fanciful airship Luna, part of the new park's central attraction A Trip to the Moon, or after Dundy's sister. Luna Park was a vastly expanded attraction built partly on the grounds of Sea Lion Park, the first enclosed amusement park on Coney Island which closed down due to competition from nearby Steeplechase Park.\nIn 1905, Frederick Ingersoll, who was already making a reputation for his pioneering work in roller coaster construction and design (he also designed scenic railroad rides) borrowed the name when he opened Luna Park in Pittsburgh and Luna Park in Cleveland. These first two amusement parks, like their namesake, were covered with electric lighting (the former was adorned with 67,000 light bulbs; the latter, 50,000). Later, in 1907, Charles Looff opened another Luna Park in Seattle, Washington. Ultimately, Ingersoll opened 44 Luna Parks around the world, the first chain of amusement parks. For a short time, Ingersoll renamed his parks Ingersoll's Luna Park to distinguish them from the Luna Parks to which he had no connection. Ingersoll's death in 1927 and the closing of most of his Luna Parks did not stop new parks from taking the name.\nToday, the term luna park or lunapark means \"amusement park\" in several European languages. These include Indo-European languages such as Polish, French, and Dutch, as well as in Greek (\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba, lo\u00fana park). In Turkish, a Turkic language, lunapark means \"funfair\", a similar term.\n\n\n== List of Luna Parks ==\n\n\n=== In Africa ===\n\n\n=== In Asia ===\n\n\n=== In Europe ===\n\n\n=== In North America ===\n\n\n=== In Oceania ===\n\n\n=== In South America ===\n\n\n== In fiction ==\nIn the animated series Futurama, Luna Park is the name of an amusement park located on the moon.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Sursock family (also spelled Sursuq) is a Greek Orthodox Christian family from Lebanon, and one of the most important \u201cSeven Families\u201d of Beirut. Having originated in Constantinople during the Byzantine Empire, the family has lived in Beirut since 1714, when they began to establish significant positions of power within the flourishing Ottoman Empire. The family, through lucrative business ventures, savvy political maneuvering, and strategic marriages, embarked on what Leila Fawaz called \"the most spectacular social climb of the nineteenth century,\" and, by their peak, had built a close network of relations to the families of Egyptian, French, Irish, Russian, Italian and German aristocracies, alongside a manufacturing and distribution empire spanning the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Sursocks were one of Beirut's aristocratic Christian families that moved freely in Ottoman, Egyptian and European high societies. The Sursocks were an integral part of an international bourgeoisie centered in Alexandria, Beirut, Cairo, Istanbul, Paris and Rome. They were one of the \"Seven Families\" in Beirut's aristocratic nobility. Their wealth and sophistication are also reflected in their residences,  equal in elegance to any Italian palazzo, which remained largely unscathed despite fifteen years of  mortar fire and violence.In the 17th century, members of the Sursock family served as tax collectors and held other key positions on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, they benefitted greatly from the 1858 Ottoman land reforms, during which they acquired large tracts of fertile land in Palestine and Syria, in addition to extensive holdings from Egypt to Beirut. \nThe means by which this Greek-Orthodox Ottoman family came into possession of such particularly palatial real estate were multiple. As a long line of land owners and tax collectors, the Sursocks were able to leverage their finances and capital using their connections to American, Russian, German and French consuls over the decades to establish extensive economic and political connections.\nThe family developed wide social ties and was close to key Ottoman and European figures, frequently playing host to a wide range of royals and diplomats, including King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, William I, Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, amongst other monarchs.The Sursocks built their fortune through their successful manufacturing and transportation empire, which extended from Turkey to Egypt and ultimately to the United Kingdom. Dimitri Sursock was the founder of \"Sursock and Brothers,\" a prominent firm in nineteenth century Beirut which acted as an agent for Lascaridi and Company in the 1850s and 1860s and shipped grain to London, Cyprus and throughout Europe. The firm and its assets were subsequently taken over by his sons after his death: Nicolas, Moussa, Loutfallah, Khalil, Ibrahim and Joseph.In addition to their manufacturing and export activities, the family increased its fortune as landowners in the Ottoman Levant, amassing profits from both rent and tax collection, as well as from the sale of their many properties. Based in Beirut, the family owned many properties along the Mediterranean region, and, for over one hundred years, the Sursocks owned a significant amount of real estate in the heart of Mersin, Turkey, including many shops and properties in the eponymous Sursock Quarter of the city. Their financial activities were wide-ranging, and included shipping and the production of silk and other goods built for transport to London and throughout the region.\nThe Sursocks also became heavily involved in banking in Egypt and Lebanon, where they helped finance major projects including the Suez Canal, the Beirut-Damascus highway, and the Beirut Harbour Company. The family also served as direct creditors to Ismail Pasha and other members of Egyptian royalty, who soon found themselves heavily involved with and indebted to the family. As a result of their extensive financial activities, the family was branded \"the Rothschilds of the East,\" and indeed engaged the Rothschild banking family during their sale of the Jezreel Valley to the Jewish National Fund in 1906. The Sursocks are recorded as having been deeply intertwined in Freemasonry at the time, under the Grand Orient of France, with many speculating on the reasons behind the family's rise. George Dimitri Sursock, Worshipful Master of the Grand Orient lodge, recorded his extensive dealings with, and on behalf of, the masonry.However, members of the family also gained notoriety for taking advantage of the famine in Lebanon during the First World War by selling overpriced basic food supplies, and for selling large swaths of Arab land in Palestine to Jewish settlers, who demanded the oftentimes forceful eviction of the peasant residents.In the wake of the Lebanese Civil War many members of the family  relocated to various European and Asian capitals, but Lady Cochrane Sursock remained in Beirut as the family matriarch. Despite the vast damage  to Beirut during the conflict, the main Sursock residence lies untouched alongside buildings whose outer walls bear scars caused by years of violence.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor many decades, the Sursocks were Lebanon's leading business family. As business partners of the Otis Elevator Company, they were successful industrialists and played a key role in the development and manufacturing of elevators.The Sursocks have shaped Lebanon's history from the late Ottoman period to present; indeed, the selection of Beirut, which would come to be known as the 'Pearl of the Orient,' as the provincial capital was in no small part the result of their entreaties to the Porte.According to Lady Cochrane Sursock, daughter of Alfred Bey Sursock and Donna Maria Teresa Serra di Cassano, the name is a corruption of \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u0399\u03c3\u03b1\u03b1\u03ba (\"Kyrie Isaac\", meaning Lord Isaac).  The family left Constantinople at its fall in 1453, settling near Byblos. Other sources list the name as having been derived from the Arabic phrases for \"secrets\" and \"market.\"\nTowards the close of the 18th century the Sursock family then moved to Beirut where they subsequently became successful traders, exporting grain from the east Mediterranean to the United Kingdom, whilst also engaging in the import of textiles from Europe to be sold throughout the Middle East. Nicolas Sursock founded the Banque Sursock et Fr\u00e8res in 1858 and purchased extensive properties throughout different parts of the Ottoman Empire.The Sursocks soon became prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and dragomen to numerous European and American consul-generals and were afforded political privileges and protection by the various countries with whom they had ties, including Russia,  Germany, Greece, Ireland and the United States of America. Moussa Sursock, the 8th Duke of Cassano, his brothers and his father Alfred are reported to have travelled on Greek and Russian passports as well as to have gained prot\u00e9g\u00e9 status with other European consulates in Beirut as a result of their wide-ranging activities. Furthermore, the Sursocks' heavy involvement in Egyptian affairs allowed the family to form close relations with members of the monarchy including Khedive Sa'id of Egypt, who reigned from 1854 to 1863, and his nephew Isma'il Pasha (1863-1879), affording them preferential deals on large infrastructural projects and extravagant public works.\n\nThe Sursocks\u2032 success was measured by their admission to the highest circles of both the Ottoman and European elite political spheres. They formed close connections with officials in Istanbul, while aristocrats often approached them to intercede on their behalf with the Ottoman government. One sign of their intimacy with the sources of Ottoman power was the appointment of Alfred Sursock to the post of secretary at the Ottoman embassy in Paris in 1905, who then joined Moussa, Michel and Yusuf Sursock in taking seats within the Ottoman power structure. In addition to connections with Paris, a French report written the following year listed Moussa Sursock as dragoman of the German Consul, and a year later, Mathilde Sursock married Alberto Theodoli, the Italian president of the League of Nations Permanent Mandates Commission, in Paris, thereby extending the family's reach around the Mediterranean. Further evidence of the Sursocks' influence can be found in the court accounts recorded under Russian Grand Duke Nicolai Nikolaevich, identifying Nicolas Sursock, who had long maintained a strong relationship with the court, as an \"Honorary Dragoman\" of Russia.\nAlfred, meanwhile, moved throughout the titled circles of Europe and married Donna Maria Teresa Serra di Cassano, daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano, who came from an old Italian princely family from Naples. Their daughter Yvonne would be known as Lady Cochrane after marrying Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Baronet, bearing four children.\nMichel Sursock, a deputy to the Ottoman parliament, became infamous during the great famine in the First World War for hoarding grain and speculating on the supply. He would not sell the grain, which cost 40 piastres in peacetime, for less than 250 piastres.\n\n\n== Assets ==\nBeirutWhen Moussa Sursock died in 1890, his grand share of the Sursock family assets was divided amongst his brothers, nephews, wife, three sons and five daughters. The assets left to the family included a wide range of real estate in and around Beirut, Mersin (Adana, Turkey), Tartus (Syria) and Alexandria (Egypt) which afforded the heirs significant influence over the region. Moussa also passed on extensive rural holdings, including entire villages in Egypt and Palestine, land situated on Mount Lebanon and, notably, a chateau that would become the fashionable resort of Sofar on Mount Lebanon.The Sursock villa in Sofar, constructed in the early twentieth century by Alfred Sursock for his wife Donna Maria di Cassano, bears original foundation inscriptions that proclaim the wealth of these merchants-turned-aristocrats. Though this Greek Orthodox family of foreign proteges often adopted the style and manners of French and other European elite, the Arabic inscriptions indicate deep traces of an Ottoman alliance stretching back centuries.Nicolas Sursock built himself a spectacular private villa in 1912 and decreed in his will that the villa be transformed into a museum after his death. Thus, when he died in 1952 the villa was bequeathed to the city of Beirut. The Sursock mansion,  built in 1912, is an exceptional, pearl white structure at the top of a hill in Beirut's luxurious Achrafieh neighbourhood. Bringing out the best of both Venetian and Ottoman architecture, the building is a pool of influences, not dissimilar to the capital itself. Originally the residence of aristocratic art-lover Nicolas Sursock, it was bequeathed to the city on his death in 1952. The Sursock Museum collection consists of 5,000 pieces, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, and iconography, all of which date back to the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The Sursock Museum building embodies Lebanese architecture with its Italianate, specifically Venetian, and Ottoman architectural influences.\nThe museum is currently undergoing an extensive US$12 million renovation led by French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte and Lebanese architect Jacques Aboukhaled.Rue Sursock, in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, is named after the family, which owned and continues to own palatial homes on the street, such as Sursock House. Lady Cochrane Sursock, who in 1946 married Sir Desmond Cochrane, is the owner of the Sursock House, as well as a vast amount of property along Rue Sursock, up to the fashionable Rue Gouraud. Nicolas Sursock transformed the house into a museum of art and amassed a large collection of art and glass. But it was Lady Cochrane's father, Alfred Bey Sursock, who initially expanded the size of the Sursock palace gardens and contributed most to the collections of art, carpets and other exquisite items, which are amongst the finest and best preserved in the Middle East. The palace is also home to a large collection of Italian artwork from the 16th and 17th centuries, many contemporary Lebanese pieces and antique Lebanese jewelry.In 1918, the Sursock family financed the building of the Beirut Hippodrome. Alfred Sursock, who funded the endeavor, agreed to a deal with the city of Beirut regarding the development of 600,000 square meters in Beirut's pine forest. The Hippodrome project was to include a public causeway, a movie theater and a casino in addition to the hippodrome itself. The hippodrome complex was ultimately built in 1921, with the casino eventually becoming the seat of the French Mandate Authorities in Lebanon.\nThe Sursocks had also previously built Lebanon's first casino, the Sawfar Grand Hotel, in the late 1880s.In 1882, a consortium headed by the Sursock family won an Ottoman concession for the construction of a railway across the Jezreel Valley. The family sought to build a railway there both to raise land value around the line, which was mostly family-owned, and to enjoy economies of scale in the transport of goods from the Hauran, also owned by the family, to the Mediterranean Sea for export.\nIn 1883, Sir Laurence Oliphant founded a company along with Gottlieb Schumacher, one of the founders of the German Colony of Haifa, to find investors for attaining a construction permit for the Sursock family, and capital for the construction itself.\nOn June 13, 1883, early surveying work was completed and Oliphant began to look for investors, both in Britain and Germany. In a letter he wrote to the Duke of Sutherland, Oliphant claimed that the construction of the line was extremely important both politically and economically, that it would eventually serve as the connection between Asia Minor, the Fertile Crescent, and Egypt, and expressed fear that the line would be under sole German ownership. Oliphant and his peers advertised the line as extremely profitable for investors, estimating the gain at 34%, and promising additional permits to construct additional extensions, a modern port in Haifa or Acre, and a shipping company. For that purpose, Oliphant purchased additional lands on Haifa's coast, and in the Megiddo area.\nDespite these efforts, the plans failed \u2014 the British government, the only one interested in the project, sent the Duke of Sutherland to inspect it, who refused to help sponsor the project. The Lebanese families headed by Mr. Sursock, who wished to build the railway for their personal needs, instead saw their permit and subsequent deposit with Sultan Abdul Hamid II  expire two years later.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\n\nMichel Sursock was a high-ranking member of Ottoman parliament and a senior dragoman to the Persian Empire, having been granted the title \"Senator of the Empire.\"  Similarly, Moussa, Michel-Ibrahim and Yusuf Sursock all served as members of Ottoman parliament for a number of years, beginning in 1912.Girgi Dimitri Sursock (1852-1913), married Marie Assad ZAHAR, dragoman at the German General Consulate in Beirut. He was decorated with the Order of Osmanieh. He publishes several books, including \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 and \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a. He is in contact with many intellectuals of al-Nahda, but also with foreign scientists, including the orientalist Martin Hartmann. Freemason, he was for many years the Worshipful Master of \u201cLe Liban\u201d Lodge in Beirut.\nGeorge Moussa Sursock had developed close ties with a wide variety of rulers and members of Europe's monarchy, from Franz Joseph of Austria to William of Germany and Louis Prince of Battenberg. Moussa was also involved in Freemasonry, as is evidenced in archives and letters addressed to the Grand Orient in Paris, dated April 1906, as well as in other sources such as \"Les Grandes Families.\" Alfred Bey Sursock married Donna Maria Teresa Serra, daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano. His daughter Yvonne married the British aristocrat Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Bart. and became known as Lady Cochrane Sursock. His first cousin Nicolas married Alfred\u2032s sister-in-law Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano, also a daughter of the Duke. Nicolas\u2032 eldest sister married Marchese Alberto Theodoli, and his youngest, Isabelle, married the head of the Colonna family, an ancient Roman family whose history spans nine hundred years.Catherine Aleya Beriketti Sursock, who was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1938 and was formerly the wife of Lebanese aristocrat Cyril Sursock (son of Nicolas Sursock and Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano), married Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan in November 1972 in the British West Indies. (His father, Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III is said to have traced his bloodline to the Prophet Muhammad and was the leader of the Ismailis, who form the second largest branch of Shia Islam). \nThe Prince's marriage to Catherine brought with it three sons: Alexandre Sursock, who married Thai  Mom Rajawongse Charuvan Rangsit Prayurasakdi, Marc Sursock and Nicolas Sursock.Alexandre Sursock, son of Cyril Sursock, married Princess Mom Rajawongse Charuvan Rangsit of Thailand (by Mom Nalini) on 9 September 1978.Michail (Michael) Sursock is a leading figure in Asia's Private Equity and financial sphere, where he continues to serve as an adviser to numerous companies, having built his name as a leader of several multinational businesses across Europe, America and Asia. Michail has spent time as CEO of KKR Capstone for Asia Pacific, as a Managing Director at Motorola Inc, and as a President with Mars across three continents. Additionally Mr. Sursock is an Advisor and Speaker at the Tuck School of Leadership Dartmouth  and a member of its Asia Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Marshall Goldsmith Leadership 100.\nRobert Sursock, over many decades, established himself as a premier banker in Paris and beyond, having built and grown such institutions as PrimeCorp Finance, Gazprombank Invest Mena and Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Invessement.Cairo's most famous restaurant entrepreneur, Nicha Sursock, the co-owner of world-renowned restaurant and bar \"L'aubergine\", is also a member of the prominent Greek Orthodox family, while Cici Tommaseo Sursock was a renowned artist having hosted exhibitions throughout the world, including in Lausanne, Beirut, Cairo, New York, Rome.Isabelle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sursock fell in love with Prince Marcantonio VII Colonna, who brought her to Italy, where she was able to integrate successfully into Roman high society at a time when it was up against the rise of Mussolini. After the fall of the monarchy, Isabelle effectively replaced queen Marie Jos\u00e9 as the substitute queen of Italy, hosting regal receptions where royalty and, among the bourgeoisie, only financiers and bankers were allowed.Donna Isabelle, as she then became known, occupied a prime position amongst the \u00e9lite of Roman society throughout her long life up to the 1980s, and was a lady of great intelligence and power who intensely guarded the artistic collection of the family throughout the darkest periods of both world wars, shielding persecuted Jews and resisting the fascist powers wherever possible. She and her husband were immensely loyal to the Holy See, so much so that she was given the rare honor of Vatican citizenship.The \"alternate queen,\" as she was known in Italy's elite circles, never abandoned her palace (Palazzo Colonna), which she so profoundly loved, and continued to weave her diplomatic skills at the highest level, receiving heads of state and royalty from half the world. Narrowly escaping arrest by the Neofascists, Isabelle dedicated her life to preserving the uppermost interests and image of the family.\n\n\n== Sursock Archives ==\nThe halls of the Sursock Palace contain the historical archives of the Sursock family empire. The archives, which are divided into three categories (public, private, and commercial-accounting), primarily span from the years 1876 to 1978 and record the activities of Alfred, Moussa, Nicolas, Princess Isabelle, Lady Cochrane and other particularly prominent members of this small Greek-Orthodox family.An extensive study on the archives and the family itself can be found in Lorenzo Trombetta's 'The Private Archive of the Sursocks (Sursuqs), A Beirut Family of Christian Notables: An Early Investigation.'\n\n\n== Land sales to the Rothschild Family and early Zionist settlement ==\n\nJezreel ValleyThe family owned more than 90,000 acres, or 400,000 dunams, (364 km\u00b2) in the Jezreel Valley in Palestine, having purchased it from Ottoman authorities in their dealings with the empire. Evidence of the remarkable concentration of wealth accumulated by the Sursocks, who already owned tens of thousands of acres of the finest land in the region, can be found in records detailing their sustained purchases of numerous new villages every year.In 1872, the Ottoman Government sold Marj ibn Amir  to the Sursock family of Beirut. The Zionists began to show interest in buying the Jezreel Valley in 1891, but the Palestine Land Development Company (PLDC), a Zionist land purchasing agency, made its first purchases in 1910. In 1897, Theodore Herzl writes about the Sursock family in his diary, noting the onset of negotiations with the Jewish Colonisation Organization for the purchase of 97 villages in Palestine.In ancient times Esdraelon was the granary, and regarded as the most fertile tract of Palestine. The Sursocks were absentee landlords in the vast Marj Ibn `Amer (Jezreel Valley) in Northern Palestine. The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1901 by funding from the Baron to buy and develop land in Ottoman Palestine for Jewish settlement. The PLDC acquired land for the Jewish National Fund (JNF). Official purchasing organizations such as the Palestine Land Development Company focused on consummating the transfer of some 65,000 dunams of land in the Jezreel Valley owned by the Sursocks. On 18 December 1918, the PDLC concluded an agreement with Nagib and Albert Sursock for the purchase of 71,356 dunams in the Jezreel Valley, including Tel Adashim. The Ottomans tried to limit mass land acquisition and immigration, but had their hands tied by European pressure and also corruption and greed of officials and large landowners. The sale of land in Marj ibn Amer is a noted case. Hankin of the KKL transacted the final settlement of purchase in 1921. Hankin originally worked for the PLDC and then became the main land speculator for both agencies. The buyers demanded the existing settlers be relocated and as a result, the Arab tenant farmers were evicted, with some receiving compensation the buyers were not required by law to pay. Because the villagers paid tithes to the Sursock family in Beirut for the right to work the agricultural lands in the villages, they were deemed tenant farmers by the British Mandate authorities in Palestine, and the right of the Sursock family to sell the land to the JNF was upheld by the authorities.\nEdmond de Rothschild began investing in Palestine at the age of 37, in 1882. In 1923, he founded the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association (PICA), which carried on his work under his son, James Armand de Rothschild (1878-1957). By 1930, PICA had amassed 5,200 hectares in various parts of the country, on which it established 50 settlements that reflected the diverse models that had evolved by this time: villages (such as Pardes Hanna, Binyamina and Givat Ada, all named for members of the Rothschild family), kibbutzim, moshavim and urban localities such as Bnei Brak and Herzliya. PICA continued to assist rural settlements as well as developing or financing economic enterprises of lasting importance in the Israeli economy \u2013 wineries, the Potash Company, the Electric Company and Nesher Cement, to name a few. By the end of the Mandate (1948), PICA possessed a large proportion of the Jewish-owned land in Palestine.In the next 17 years, the Baron spent $100 million in purchasing lands, building factories, schools and hospitals.  In 1912, the PLDC contracted to purchase a large tract in the Jezreel Valley from the Sursock family of Beirut and Alexandria, but was unable to complete the transaction due to World War I.In 1929, under the British Mandate, the Sursocks sold the valley to the Baron Rothschild. The European dynasty of German Jewish origin that established European banking and finance houses from the late eighteenth century had established a fund to buy land in Palestine and encourage the immigration of Jews to Palestine.The Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association \u2013 PICA- was founded in 1924 by Edmond to administer the settlements in Palestine and took over the role of the Jewish Colonisation Association of 1900. PICA was the largest Jewish landowner in Palestine. Edmond\u2019s involvement with Jewish settlements began in 1882 when he funded Rishon Le-Zion (\u2018The First in Zion\u2019) He established Zikhron Yaakov and Mazkeret Batya (named after his parents) and built  social and religious institutions there. Edmond also stimulated the economic development by investing in new crops, such as wine, grapefruit and avocado, and industrial enterprises such as silk production. After Edmond\u2019s death in 1934 his son James de Rothschild (1878-1957) presided over the affairs of PICA until in 1957, the year of his death, he decided to transfer all PICA holdings to national institutions. His determination to continue to support Israeli institutions was carried out after his death by his wife, Dorothy (1895-1988), who founded Yad Hanadiv. When Edmond died in Paris in 1934, he left a legacy which included the reclamation of nearly 500,000 dunams of land and almost 30 settlements.\nIn 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (JNF-KKL). Urgency for large colonization, quick purchase, and rapid self-sufficiency by means of general agriculture made the Jezreel Valley the focus of land purchasing plans. The Zionist Organization thought the Jezreel Valley to be more desirable than even the coastal region where smaller parcels of land were available for purchase. Buying parcels in the coastal region involved more complicated purchasing negotiations. The coastal region was also the center of orange cultivation, a type of agriculture that would not yield a profit for several years, thus potentially impeding the Labor Zionist idea of self reliant settlement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine, evidence to the Shaw Commission, 1930\n Media related to Sursock family at Wikimedia Commons",

          "We were taken to the Museum, not knowing what to expect, but the whole experience was very impressive. The building, the decor, the Paintings and Exhibitions. The Cafe and Bookshop adjacent were well worth a visit.",

          "Sadly this beautiful villa has lost most of his ancient style to make space for a nice museum , very interesting to see anyway",

          "The Sursock Museum's located in the charming neighbourhood of Gemmayze and surrounded by cosy bars and plush apartments. It's an incredibly beautiful building and I was sad that there wasn't more to see inside with four floors providing four or five smaller exhibitions and a",

          "What is now the Nicolas Sursock Museum was once a home to one of Beirut's richest and most affluent families. It is now home to hundreds of artworks from some of Lebanon's most famous painters and sculptors. Each floor represents a different era in Lebanon's modern history.",
          "A big residential building has been allowed on part of the land of the garden; thus the museum does not appear so magnificent as it is and it should. Partly shadowed, it looks now as overwhelmed and threatened by a nasty giant.",
          "It is a small museum in a historic buidlung in a very nice area. Mostly modern paintings of local artists from 20. century. free entrance! nice Caf\u00e9 after the visit",
          "I visited this museum somewhat on a whim due to the suggestion of my tour guide. Nicolas Sursock was a wealthy Lebanese aristocrat who bequeathed the building and a number of pieces of fine art to the city after his death; everything was renovated about a decade ago to the tune",
          "The exhibitions on the upper floors are wonderful. The design and general architecture of the building is superb. On the lower ground floors there are various installations which are some of the best I have ever visited. Treat yourself to this wonderful Museum",
          "This is a lovely save with art work curated by Nicolas Sursock from the 1950s until the civil war began. He arranged a sequence of traveling shows over the years that brought foreign collections in to Beirut and collected some wonderful lebanese art over the years leading up to",

          "This is a must visit destination in Beirut. The status of the building is immaculate, the Arab room is an architecture reference, and the museum shop has lovely items for house furnishing. Usually there are temporary exhibitions.",
          "This museum has lost its spirit. The display is cold and impersonal. They used to have labels in French and Arabic tout French has disappeared in what is still the French-speaking neighbourhood of Beirut. They could have a trilingual display as it is in Mim museum. The art",
          "It was a night for the museums and many museums in Lebanon were participating at this event and we're free to the public...from outside it's an old building renovated; three main floors to be discovered...one is a contemporary art that is nice...another one is the owner's",

          "I will say straight out that I don't know much about modern art. So I'm not really in a position to comment on whether the collection is excellent or in poor taste. I can say that it really shows off lots of local artists well. Also, the gallery is clean and quite well run.",
          "To begin with the art on display is housed in a beautiful building and the exhibitions on the day of my visit combined a view of the old, and the new or emerging Beirut and Lebanon based artists. I enjoyed spending time at Sursock and seeing the creative side of this interesting",

          "First of all, I have no idea why this museum isn't on the top 20 list of things to do in Beirut. The top 20 list is a sham anyway, they list random pointless stuff like the Zeituna Bay broadwalk, which is just a walk along the beach and nothing special. But this museum is",
          "Well designed architecture with very well choosen art. If you're interested in seeing abstract work of various Lebanese artists, then this museum is a must see. On a cheeky side note; the sinks at the restrooms are an art of their own.",
          "The building is stunning and inside, a wide array of art and constantly changing art exhibitions spanning painting, instillations, photography and more. There are weekly events always scheduled at the museum, so I recommend checking their website and social media for the program.",
          "We went there for the company annual Christmas lunch and we visited the museum after lunch. The food was exquisite and the museum collection very interesting. Highly recommended for those who want to see something cultural in Beirut",
          "I visited the museum on a quiet Thursday afternoon. I walked up Escalier St Nicolas and then got totally lost. I walked around for ages. A simple sign at the top of the stairs would have avoided that. Please invest in one (you just turn left at the top). The house itself is",
          "We visited this museum on a Friday afternoon and enjoyed it. 2 floors and 2 basements with pieces of art from Lebanese artists. Must see if you are interested in Lebanese modern art.",

          "Entering the museum from the main street, you are struck by its resilience next to the giant structures surrounding it. It's a statement of the determination of the owners to preserve a snapshot of a bygone Beirut while Beirutans themselves don't seem to care about much",

        "wiki": "Beit ed-Dine (Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u200e), also known as Btaddine (Arabic: \u0628\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646\u200e) is a small town and the administrative capital of the Chouf District in the Mount Lebanon Governorate in Lebanon. The town is located 45 kilometers southeast of Beirut, and near the town of Deir el-Qamar from which it is separated by a steep valley. It had 1,613 registered voters in 2010 and its inhabitants are predominantly Christians from the Maronite, Melkite and Greek Orthodox denominations. Beit ed-Dine's total land area consists of 244 hectares and its average elevation is 860 meters above sea level.The town is well known for the Beiteddine Palace, which hosts the annual summer Beiteddine Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\nEmir Bashir II of the Shihab dynasty, who later became the ruler of the Mount Lebanon Emirate, started building the palace in 1788 at the site of the Druze hermitage (hence the town's name, translating as \"House of Faith\"), indicating that the town was initially populated by Druze before Bashir lived in it. Bashir moved the headquarters of the emirate from Deir al-Qamar to Beit ed-Dine by 1811. He ruled from the palace he built, known as the Beiteddine Palace, which he supplied with water by building a lengthy canal connecting the palace to the Safa River.After 1840, when Emir Bashir II was sent into exile the palace was used by the Ottomans as a government building. During the French Mandate its role was preserved and it served as a local administrative office. In 1934, it was declared a national monument. During the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, around 200 Christians from Deir al-Qamar fled to the Ottoman barracks at Beit ed-Dine to seek shelter before their town was attacked by Druze fighters. After Deir al-Qamar was plundered by the Druze and its inhabitants massacred, they proceeded to attack the Christians who were sheltering at Beit ed-Dine. The outnumbered Ottoman garrison did not resist and the barracks was assaulted. During the French-led international intervention in the war, the French colonel, d'Arricau, chose Bashir's palace in Beiteddine as his headquarters. In the 1860s, the headquarters of the Ottoman deputy governor in Mount Lebanon was relocated to the Beiteddine Palace.During official celebrations in Beit ed-Dine marking the enthronement of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1908, Druze and Maronites from the vicinity clashed in the town, resulting in the deaths of one person from each sect. A week later, a delegation of the local, reformist Liberal Party issued a set of demands in Beit ed-Dine calling for reforms such as the abolition of new taxes and the dismissal of corrupt officials. The governor of Beirut Vilayet, Yusuf Pasha, rejected the demands and ordered the demonstrator's dispersal. However, the Ottoman garrison in Beit ed-Dine sympathized with the demonstrators and refused to disperse them. The governor ultimately acceded to the demonstrators' demands.\n\n\n=== Modern Era ===\n\nIn 1943, Bechara El Khoury, the first Lebanese President, declared it the official president's summer residence. During the Lebanese Civil War (1975\u20131990) it was heavily damaged. After 1984, when fighting in the area receded, Walid Jumblatt ordered its restoration. Parts of the palace are today open to the public while the rest is still the president's summer residence. \nBashir built three more palaces in the town for his sons, till today only Mir Amin Palace survived and is today a luxury hotel.Beiteddine is home to a Lebanese Red Cross First Aid Center.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchitecture of Lebanon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nText of Beit El Dine and virtual tour image\nMiddleEast.com\nLebGuide\nLebanon, the Cedars' Land: Beiteddine",

The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the Amarna letters from the New Kingdom of Egypt, which date to the 15th century BC.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with most banks and corporations based in its Central District, Badaro, Rue Verdun, Hamra, Ryad el Soleh street, and Achrafieh. Following the destructive Lebanese Civil War, Beirut's cultural landscape underwent major reconstruction. Identified and graded for accountancy, advertising, banking, finance and law, Beirut is ranked as a Beta World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayr\u016bt (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French occupation. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician Berot or Birut (\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd15\u200e Brt). This was a modification of the Canaanite and Phoenician word be'rot, meaning \"the wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The etymology is shared by the biblical Beeroth (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea) which was, however, a different settlement somewhere near Jerusalem. The name is first attested in the 15th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.The Greeks hellenised the name as B\u0113ryt\u00f3s (Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nBefore, under the Seleucid Empire, the city had been already founded and known as Laodicea in honour of the mother of Seleucus the Great. It was distinguished from several other places named in her honour by the longer names Laodicea in Phoenicia (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u1fc3, romanized: Laod\u00edkeia h\u0113 en Phoin\u00edk\u0113i) or Laodicea in Canaan (Phoenician: \ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd03\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd00 \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd14 \ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd0d, romanized: Ll\u02bedk\u02be \u02be\u0161 bkn\u02bfn).\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nBeirut was settled more than 5,000 years ago and the area had been inhabited for far longer. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Fran\u00e7ais in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.Beirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.Beirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticised by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area.Beirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.Beirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.Beirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement was on an easily defended island in the river that, however, progressively silted up and joined it to the mainland. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, and Ottoman remains.\n\n\n=== Phoenician period ===\n\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorisation was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\n\n=== Hellenistic period ===\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon in his contest with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the end of the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of this Hellenistic period. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control, however after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, veteran soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken.Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions. Consequently, the city quickly became fully Romanized: it was one of four Roman colonies (coloniae) in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation.\nIts territory under Claudius reached the Bekaa valley and included Heliopolis (Baalbek): it was the only mostly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia region, because it was settled by Roman colonists who even promoted agriculture in the fertile lands around Yammoune. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony. Its law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught there under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire. After the 551 Beirut earthquake the students were transferred to Sidon.The post-war salvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. Prince Arslan bin al-Mundhir founded the Principality of Sin el Fil in Beirut in 759. From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon, which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon, today's Lebanon. As a trading centre of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was overshadowed by Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197.  John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204.  He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512\u20131520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks.\nAfter Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\n\n==== Vilayet of Beirut ====\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Dr. Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\nThese families are:\n\nAll other families of Beirut are considered to have descended from one of those seven main branches, such as Nahhas, Yanout Inkidar, Hajjal, Hamza and others who derived from the Sinno Family (p. 14).\nSinno is considered to be an old family in Beirut, descending from the Muslim Leader Tareq Bin Ziyad.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Capital of Lebanon ====\n\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975\u20131976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city has somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has been host to the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960\u20131964, 1999, 2001\u20132002.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.In the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) characterised by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, winter is mild and rainy. Summer is hot and can be virtually rainless and very dry although it can get very muggy, especially in August. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October - April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public garden ( sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact concrete roofs cover 80% Of the capital area.\n\n\n=== Quarters and sectors ===\n\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikha\u00ebl)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRemeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-BlatThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs.Badaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favourite hip nightlife destination.Two of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more common.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. The city boasts significant Muslim and Christian communities. In Beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups. At the end of the civil war the Copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. The original seventeen included four Muslim sects: Shi'a, Sunni, 'Alawi, and Druze; Twelve Christian sects: Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholics, Protestant Evangelicals, and other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, Assyrians (Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic), Copts; and Jews (very few remain in Lebanon today, but children of Lebanese Jewish parents may register as citizens at Lebanese Embassies.) Briefly, Christians are 52% of Beirut, Muslims 47%, and 1% others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognised by Lebanese civil authorities.\nBefore the civil war the neighbourhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict.  East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. The southern suburbs are populated largely by Shia Muslims, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian.\nThe city is also home to a small number of Latin Rite Roman Catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with Archbishop Paul Dahdah, OCD, as the apostolic vicar.\n\n\n== Beirut Central District ==\n\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country.\" It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, F\u00eate de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticised for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down  \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.Finally, the actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. With its seaport and airport\u2014coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates\u2014Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban, Lebanon's central bank, the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\n\n=== Banking and finance ===\n\nThe Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East,\" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).The largely pedestrianised Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-fa\u00e7ade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouch\u00e9, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouch\u00e9 Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighbourhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighbourhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighbourhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming caf\u00e9 and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.  There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath caf\u00e9s of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.Hamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighbouring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic Bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighbourhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colourful and chic caf\u00e9s amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totalling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.Many of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighbouring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organised, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialised procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International organisations ===\nThe city is home to numerous international organisations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes.\nThe American University of Beirut and Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph (USJ), are the oldest respectively English medium and French medium universities in the country.\nThe Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to the Lebanese American University (LAU), which is also, together with many of its programs, accredited by US bodies and considered lately one of the top universities in the Middle East. Beirut is also home to the American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), as well as the Notre Dame University \u2013 Louaize (NDU), Universit\u00e9 La Sagesse (ULS).\nNotre Dame University (NDU)'s degrees are becoming more and more valuable with time. NDU received its accreditation from NIASC in 2015.\nThe Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing the university colleges, university institutes and universities in Beirut and nationwide.Among the private secondary schools in Beirut are, College Saint Joseph Antoura, Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais, Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame de Jamhour, College Melkart, Carmel Saint-Joseph, Coll\u00e8ge Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Nazareth, Coll\u00e8ge du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Gemmayz\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge Protestant Fran\u00e7ais, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by ferry from Cyprus via the nearby city of Jounieh or by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC \u2013 \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.The ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.Beirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilisations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading centre of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.Beirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighbouring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year.

          "Among the most civilized shopping centers; variety, quality, entertainment, style, nice people ; the absolute shopping experience. Visit French cafeterias and the cinema area.",
          "Lots of speciality shops eager to drain your wallet, from L'Occitane to Zara Home (and a lot more expensive places). If you don't mind all the kids on those darn hoverboards banging into your shins in the courtyard area in front of the movie theater, making your way to Beirut",
          "Very nice place with lots of shops but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s like the souks you see in Marrakesh or Istanbul with small store selling local goods. Most of what the call souks in Beirut are Malls with designer labels.",
          "I liked the whole neighborhood but beware this is not a traditional souk its totally renovated and it's actually a mall with a variety of international shops.",
          "Well, if I see the name \"souks\" in an arab country, I imagine something else than this souks. The traditiopnal souks were demaged, and now it is a modern place, like a normal shopping mall, thus it was different than what I expected....",
          "5 years ago it was great and now it\u2019s starting to loose its charm more and more, shops are closing and there just aren\u2019t any cool events like before apart from souk tayeb",
          "Excellent place, a must see mall. Architecture design is superb. Very enjoyable for couples and families. Visit every time I am in the area.",
          "At least as far as we could tell. Beautiful, spacious, clean and with some good stores, but not that many unique ones.",
          "Well, it\u2019s a quite place where u can have lunch or dinner pretty hot some how in early morning , some shops around the corner . I didn\u2019t try any food there .",
          "The best thing about the Souks is the Saturday food market - otherwise it\u2019s not much more than a (high-end) shopping spot: Hermes, Chanel and H&M. It\u2019s perhaps worth a quick walk through, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend planning a trip specifically for it.",
          "If you know beirut before 1975, then you give one star. If you are disconnected from culture and history the superficial luxury can impress you. Life was replaced by stones, culture by a quest for luxury shopping outlets. A luxury business district totally deserted, built based",
          "many shops are closed, felt kinda empty, apparently Beirut's economy is not going well and it leaves the place feeling a bit abandoned.",
          "This is not a souk in the traditional meaning of the word. Rather it is a modern shopping centre/mall, with the usual international chain stores. I do not see why any tourist would shop here when it merely contains the same shops they would have back home. Personally, I",
          "Awesome shopping experience within vintage streets with both designer label and traditional stores with a wide variety. Simple amazing",
          "if you would like to buy some fancy items, this area is the best for this, you have all the fancy brands in the area, and some very good resturants and cafes, in addition to a cinema",
          "Severl plces to eat, the met, casper, kahwet beirut and lots of diffrnt places to have lunch diner or desert. I go for a walk during my lunch break to it s very nice and includes shoping ceter , fitness club and bookshop.",
          "the very rich souks offers a wide selection of shops and businesses. You can also do late night shopping as the shops are opened till late night.",
          "A modern twist to the traditional old beirut souks with branded shops and stores. It is bery enjoyable to walk and shop since its partly outdoor and partly indoor. Parking is available as well. A must visit when in Beirut.",
          "Not a traditional middle eastern Souk, this is a high end shopping destination with prestige brands and Starbucks. Still worth the visit.",
          "the souks is full with all international brands, a good cinema, library and have nice architecture..",
          "I was blown by it\u2019s beauty!!! Love love the architecture. Contemporary mixed with traditional with history... The vibes... Great place to hang out, to shop and to discover. A must do.",
          "This place is like an outdoor mall, you can find everything. Luxury Brands, famous restaurants and some many places to get distracted and take the kids.",
          "Although famous for its high end stores, we went here for movies and late night dinners. Love the environment. Don't forget the mandatory pic with \"I \u2764Beirut\" sign.",
          "Elegant part of town with mid to high end fashion shops. Not too crowded at night. Felt a bit like a tourist trap. A shawarma sandwich was $16 which seems a bit high. Safe for families but not worth much of a see unless you want to shop at designer shops.",
          "Expensive clothes, no customers, however it was the middle of the day. Apparently it's open 24/7 and is more popular in the evenings.",
          "It\u2019s nice how this area was made over, casual and chic with several cafes and bistros, a little bit resembling Paris sidewalk cafes, but with a distinctive Lebanese flavour.",
          "it was nice walking around Beirut souks, there are a lot of shops. You can enjoy your ice cream while walking through the souks :)",
          "A renovated and constructed area with a large amount of shops, boutiques, restaurants, amusement centers and movies. It has many open areas for strolling around. Its Gold Souk is famous. Many events take place in Beyrout Souks every once in a while.",
          "I spent a few hours here walking around, it\u2019s hot in summer and probably not a great thing to do, it wasn\u2019t busy so I guess everyone thinks the same. I would imagine the evenings are busier when the weather gets cooler It\u2019s a very new, clean and open plan area Do visit",
          "A nice and modern shopping area. maybe this is a good place if your into high end shopping but to be honest You will find pretty much the same things here as in any fancy shopping mall in the world. Close to this big shopping area there is a very nice food market \"Souk El",
          "When searching for old Beirut traditional souks this new hyper mall stands . With high street brands as well as normal shops in addition to restaurants & cafe\u2019s this souk is the place for all family shopping also fitness in the gym if desired . Efficient staff available to",
          "I could not find the rest rooms, very minimal signboard Love the place, highly merited for cleanliness and charm",
          "it was a great experience, food an cafes are good, the area is provided by good and updated services. Fancy shops are located in this area",
          "A must visit when in Beirut. Just walk from one street to another for window shopping or actual shopping. Few nice restaurants and best movies.",
          "you can easily spend around 3 hours in that place. safe for children , many restaurants different kitchens ,amusement places, amazing cinemas ( advanced and new movies). you can visit even in winter due it is covered. 2 points should work on : the people who have dogs should",
          "Beirut is a great place for bargains if you have the time. As for me the souk offers some great clean and safe street cuisine and photo opportunities",
          "The place is all about brands shopping with no local or oriental shops. It has some restaurants and coffee shops. The problem is too much smoking and hookah. The scenes close to the area are very nice as they are historical places just next to modern places",
          "You can go for a walk or for watching movie or even for shopping !! Beirut souks is full of life and there\u2019s many shops(clothes,makeup,coffee shops,carts....and much more) in addition to the restaurants in Beirut souks area! And tourist places!",
          "Not that I have been to Paris but from what I have seen in pictures and on TV, Beirut souks remind me of the shopping center in Paris and other famous European capitals and cities.",
          "Its a really beautiful place to visit during days in Beirut. Loved every moment of enjoying there. The food court is good and affordable. Apart from a few shops, its very expensive. Hamra street is a better option however.",
          "Nice to see the new architecture but that\u2019s about it. As to the shops - they are the exact same ones as everywhere else in the world: H&M, Zara etc. so an absolute no go if you ate looking for a libanese shopping experience.",
          "Typical western-style outdoor shopping mall with lots of big brands and stores selling everything from beauty products to clothes, books and electronics. Don't go there if you are looking to experience a real souk or capture an \"old Beirut\" vibe. There is quite a nice and big",
          "You can find a lot of shopping centre. At each Saturday from 10 to 2 pm there are an especial market where home product will be presented",
          "It's an amazing place u can find all what h what shopping coffee shop restaurant also many cinemas . U can have a nice walk there enjoying the old souks",
          "Essentially this is a modern shopping centre of upscale brands along with a selection of restaurants, a cinema complex, car parking and toilets. Soulless, bland and just like anywhere else in the world. Nicely set up and well kept and looked after but definitely NOT a souk.",
          "It's new ,it's modern lot of luxury Shopes ,with famous brands ,still you can find Zara and H -M ,filled with restaurants ,and cafes,play area for kids",
          "But a very pretty mall. If you\u2019re expecting a romantic spices & rugs souk with incense wafting through the air, this isn\u2019t it. That said, it\u2019s a beautiful example of how modern and fabulous Beirut is as a city. Best visited on Saturdays when you can stroll through the weekly",
          "I was seeking for an old souk but found a modern shopping centre. Nothing spcial, has most of the EU retail chains like H&M, Mango, M.Dutti, etc. Architecture is good and practical. Clearly organized spaces. Good vegiterian market we found here.",
          "A variety of retail shops for all your needs and a good choice of restaurants and cafes... Movie theater and entertainment arcade around the corner",
          "After the sensory overload of souks in other Arabic and Middle Eastern cities, I had high hopes for the Beirut version. Unfortunately, the Beirut souk is all but vanished. Instead, visitors are treated to what is essentially a westernised shopping centre like one would find in",
          "Really lovely - some lovely restaurants on the square at very reasonable prices - many designer shops.",
          "The whole package of going out with children. History, architecture, shoping and security. One the rare places in lebanon to walk around with ni fear to be hit by a car or motorists! Charming place with different levels of shops. From cheap food to high brands!",
          "Although I think most of the stores in the souk are only the well-known brands & I wished to see more of Lebanon\u2019s custom shops.. however you must take a shot at its entrance of \u201cI love Beirut\u201d.. it\u2019s lovely & if you have kids, they will like to have a photo in every letter :d",
          "If you like expensive western style shopping centres this is the place you should visit. If you prefer a more traditional souk try Tripoli or Byblos.",
          "name your brand and its here. a lovely souk experience, food, cinemas, parking, and the largest variety of shops of all hues in beirut accessories to clothes to brands. its all here",
          "The place is disappointing ( the name Beirut souks) does not suit this place at all, it has very expensive boutiques for the super rich. But the inside of the building is very nice and a nice place to go for a walk and have lunch or dinner if you have fat wallet. Salad costed",
          "The best shopping place in Beirut. Great to spend the day in Beirut soouks, shopping eating walking... all in 1 place... Beautiful...",

          "Nice collection of multiple shops cinema cafe restaurants kids zone entertainment and most elegance location in Beirut",
          "Strictly for women or shopping freaks. The layout was cool. Shoppers will find almost anything they want from expensive watches to designer clothes. They have valet parking. The surrounding area is great for a nice walk if you have the energy.",
          "Called a Souk or traditional Lebanese market. The place is a renovated upmarket collection of designer shops. A good collection of items can be bought here but is less than expensive. Worth a walk though to view the shops.",
          "I was realy surprised when I saw all the designer shops in the souk. Luckily there is plenty of other shops as well for us with a smaller wallet. The area is so Nice, and it's easy to navigate in the soul. I recommend a visit to other travellers.",
          "Very nice, modern mall, with many international shops. Nice restaurants also. Saturday's morning, just in front of it, it is very interesting local food market - really worth to be there! Try smth, eat smth, drink - really tastes of Lebanon.",
          "Souk in Arabic means market. The denomination puts you off at first it sounds like a market but hence it\u2019s an upscale market and quite pricey if you compare the prices with abroad.. there\u2019s a few places to have a bite or coffee that are passable, nothing as good as the old",
          "I didn't love this place. There weren't that many people around so place felt a bit empty. And it reminded me of Dubai somehow. It was new and clean. Shops were good but somehow IT doesn't fit to Beirut's style.",
          "This is a collection of high-end retailers, mostly international, in modern buildings that bear no resemblance to a souk at all. For the genuine article go to Sidon or for an attempt at least at the original go to Dubai.To call this a souk is a travesty.",
          "Real surprise and a great place to visit, great architecture and spaces, pop up markets on Saturday morning was a real surprise complete with street food and wine for lunch highly recommended",
          "Souless place containing all the chain stores you left behind, expensive place for the gauche set, quite empty, ideal for rich Arabs looking to spend.",
          "A refreshing, positive experience. Even though still lots of work needs to be done you can feel and see that there is a positive vibe in the souk streets. clean and cozy restaurants and cafes, quiet but live, a perfect balance for a day out for shopping or eating.",
          "While there are little highlights, like the ice cream at Al Antabli and the plant market outside, this just felt more-or-less like a mall.",
          "Such variety of foods and vegetables. Buzzing and great sampling of foods....Organic vegetables. Variety of nuts............",
          "You can easly spend a whole day at beirut souks, where you can do shopping, go to the cinema, have a walk among beautiful buildings, have a arguile at the terrace, an dessert at intabli etc Suitable and affordable for all budgets Just an amazing place Love beirut",
          "if you are in Beirut to go shopping, you will find the Beirut Souks a great place to get clothes, watches etc from the high-end part of the scale. The buildings are beautiful, but the people only represents the upper-class part of the locals, so if you are looking for the more",
          "It was amazing to see such brands you cant even get inside the store. I have walked through the airport and saw the banlieus of Beirut and in here richness of Beirut. I guess there is no middle class in this country.",
          "I loved the souks. They are really nice for a stroll around and are covered up too which helps in the heat. They are very clean and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed with plenty of nice high end shops to visit.",
          "This is a beautiful souk in downtown Lebanon that you should visit on your next trip to Beirut - beautiful to look at and lots of nice shops. Get a picture of yourself with the I love Beirut sign - always something good going on there",
          "Interesting. Great place to window shop. The flower market is a delight. But who can afford to shop here?",
          "You cannot come to Beirut and visit the Souk- it is relatively new, and filled with medium to expensive shops however there are quite a few cafes and restaurants, and it is a nice place to sit and watch the world go by",

          "The difference between shopping here and at other outlets/malls is that you will not find the high end brands anywhere else in Beirut. This is a massive mult-layer open and closed market that requires a lot of walking too (escalators are available at some points too). There are",

          "Nothing to do there, and just to took a photo with \"I Love beirut\" and eat ice cream, and most of shops closed.",
          "As far as souks go this must be the most boring one in all of the Middle East. Clinical, sterile, just \u2018western\u2019 chains, glitz and glamour, no soul. Unless You plan to shop expensive clothes and items, You are way better off as a tourist experience in just about any other souk.",
          "We were disappointed with this \"souk\".Most of the shops here can be found in shopping malls in any European city.Hamra Street is far more exciting and reasonable.",
          "One of the very few nice open air spaces left for families with children in Beirut. A very rare commoditiy! The main advantage is a rather big stretch of pedestrian area where cars can't go and young children (up to 10 years old) can roam freely with their roller blades and",

          "It is by no means, a souk. It is an array of buildings full of shops much like any other city. Unless you love shopping and that's on your list of things to do, not a must see at all. There is nothing quaint or unique, nothing distinctive even. It's literally a large group of",
          "There has been much debate over the souks and the truth of the matter is, there was no old souk left to preserve. It was just a memory for those who had lived in Beirut before the war. I think solidaire did an incredible job reconstructing that image in a modern and elegant",

Near the clock tower there are lots of pigeons you can feed and the kids will love that. There is a cinema",
          "A recent addition to a vibrant city. The style and presentation of the shop is impressive but no real shoppers around. The Coffee shops are full and restaurants also. Most of the shops are known brands which you can buy internationally at a better price. I was hoping to find",

          "Nothing to do with a real oriental souk! Just a mall with all the brands you can find everywhere in the world. No charm except perhaps on saturdays when there is the souk el tayeb which is a fruit and vegetable market outside near the cinemas.There you can meet people from",

        "wiki": "Beirut ( bay-ROOT; Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e, romanized: Bayr\u016bt; French: Beyrouth, pronounced [b\u025b\u0281ut]) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. No recent population census has been conducted, but 2007 estimates ranged from slightly more than 1 million to 2.2 million as part of Greater Beirut, which makes it the third-largest city in the Levant region and the fifteenth-largest in the Arab world. Located on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast, Beirut is an important regional seaport.\nIt is one of the oldest cities in the world, having been inhabited for more than 5,000 years.  The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the Amarna letters from the New Kingdom of Egypt, which date to the 15th century BC.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with most banks and corporations based in its Central District, Badaro, Rue Verdun, Hamra, Ryad el Soleh street, and Achrafieh. Following the destructive Lebanese Civil War, Beirut's cultural landscape underwent major reconstruction. Identified and graded for accountancy, advertising, banking, finance and law, Beirut is ranked as a Beta World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayr\u016bt (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French occupation. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician Berot or Birut (\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd15\u200e Brt). This was a modification of the Canaanite and Phoenician word be'rot, meaning \"the wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The etymology is shared by the biblical Beeroth (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea) which was, however, a different settlement somewhere near Jerusalem. The name is first attested in the 15th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.The Greeks hellenised the name as B\u0113ryt\u00f3s (Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nBefore, under the Seleucid Empire, the city had been already founded and known as Laodicea in honour of the mother of Seleucus the Great. It was distinguished from several other places named in her honour by the longer names Laodicea in Phoenicia (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u1fc3, romanized: Laod\u00edkeia h\u0113 en Phoin\u00edk\u0113i) or Laodicea in Canaan (Phoenician: \ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd03\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd00 \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd14 \ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd0d, romanized: Ll\u02bedk\u02be \u02be\u0161 bkn\u02bfn).\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nBeirut was settled more than 5,000 years ago and the area had been inhabited for far longer. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Fran\u00e7ais in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.Beirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.Beirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticised by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area.Beirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.Beirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.Beirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement was on an easily defended island in the river that, however, progressively silted up and joined it to the mainland. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, and Ottoman remains.\n\n\n=== Phoenician period ===\n\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorisation was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\n\n=== Hellenistic period ===\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon in his contest with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the end of the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of this Hellenistic period. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control, however after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, veteran soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken.Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions. Consequently, the city quickly became fully Romanized: it was one of four Roman colonies (coloniae) in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation.\nIts territory under Claudius reached the Bekaa valley and included Heliopolis (Baalbek): it was the only mostly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia region, because it was settled by Roman colonists who even promoted agriculture in the fertile lands around Yammoune. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony. Its law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught there under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire. After the 551 Beirut earthquake the students were transferred to Sidon.The post-war salvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. Prince Arslan bin al-Mundhir founded the Principality of Sin el Fil in Beirut in 759. From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon, which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon, today's Lebanon. As a trading centre of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was overshadowed by Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197.  John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204.  He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512\u20131520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks.\nAfter Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\n\n==== Vilayet of Beirut ====\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Dr. Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\nThese families are:\n\nAll other families of Beirut are considered to have descended from one of those seven main branches, such as Nahhas, Yanout Inkidar, Hajjal, Hamza and others who derived from the Sinno Family (p. 14).\nSinno is considered to be an old family in Beirut, descending from the Muslim Leader Tareq Bin Ziyad.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Capital of Lebanon ====\n\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975\u20131976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city has somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has been host to the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960\u20131964, 1999, 2001\u20132002.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.In the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) characterised by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, winter is mild and rainy. Summer is hot and can be virtually rainless and very dry although it can get very muggy, especially in August. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October - April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public garden ( sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact concrete roofs cover 80% Of the capital area.\n\n\n=== Quarters and sectors ===\n\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikha\u00ebl)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRemeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-BlatThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs.Badaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favourite hip nightlife destination.Two of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more common.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. The city boasts significant Muslim and Christian communities. In Beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups. At the end of the civil war the Copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. The original seventeen included four Muslim sects: Shi'a, Sunni, 'Alawi, and Druze; Twelve Christian sects: Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholics, Protestant Evangelicals, and other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, Assyrians (Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic), Copts; and Jews (very few remain in Lebanon today, but children of Lebanese Jewish parents may register as citizens at Lebanese Embassies.) Briefly, Christians are 52% of Beirut, Muslims 47%, and 1% others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognised by Lebanese civil authorities.\nBefore the civil war the neighbourhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict.  East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. The southern suburbs are populated largely by Shia Muslims, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian.\nThe city is also home to a small number of Latin Rite Roman Catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with Archbishop Paul Dahdah, OCD, as the apostolic vicar.\n\n\n== Beirut Central District ==\n\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country.\" It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, F\u00eate de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticised for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down  \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.Finally, the actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. With its seaport and airport\u2014coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates\u2014Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban, Lebanon's central bank, the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\n\n=== Banking and finance ===\n\nThe Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East,\" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).The largely pedestrianised Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-fa\u00e7ade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouch\u00e9, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouch\u00e9 Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighbourhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighbourhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighbourhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming caf\u00e9 and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.  There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath caf\u00e9s of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.Hamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighbouring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic Bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighbourhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colourful and chic caf\u00e9s amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totalling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.Many of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighbouring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organised, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialised procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International organisations ===\nThe city is home to numerous international organisations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes.\nThe American University of Beirut and Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph (USJ), are the oldest respectively English medium and French medium universities in the country.\nThe Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to the Lebanese American University (LAU), which is also, together with many of its programs, accredited by US bodies and considered lately one of the top universities in the Middle East. Beirut is also home to the American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), as well as the Notre Dame University \u2013 Louaize (NDU), Universit\u00e9 La Sagesse (ULS).\nNotre Dame University (NDU)'s degrees are becoming more and more valuable with time. NDU received its accreditation from NIASC in 2015.\nThe Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing the university colleges, university institutes and universities in Beirut and nationwide.Among the private secondary schools in Beirut are, College Saint Joseph Antoura, Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais, Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame de Jamhour, College Melkart, Carmel Saint-Joseph, Coll\u00e8ge Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Nazareth, Coll\u00e8ge du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Gemmayz\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge Protestant Fran\u00e7ais, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by ferry from Cyprus via the nearby city of Jounieh or by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC \u2013 \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.The ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.Beirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilisations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading centre of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.Beirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighbouring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.Planet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.In October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels\u2014priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a pterodactyl is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" \u2013 an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish\u2019n\u2019Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of M\u00e9moire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life \u2013 a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year.

        "wiki": "Byblos (Arabic: \u062c\u0628\u064a\u0644\u200e Jubayl, locally Jbeil; Greek: \u0392\u03cd\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2; Phoenician: Gbl, probably Gubal) is the largest city in the Mount Lebanon Governorate of Lebanon. It is believed to have been first occupied between 8800 and 7000 BC and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nByblos appears as Kebny in Egyptian hieroglyphic records going back to the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (fl.\u20092600 BC) and as Gubla (\ud808\udc7a\ud808\uddb7) in the Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters to the 18th-dynasty pharaohs Amenhotep III and IV. In the 1st millennium BC, its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic inscriptions as Gebal (\ud802\udd02\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0b, GBL); in the Hebrew Bible as Geval (\u05d2\u05d1\u05dc); and in Syriac as GBL (\u0713\u0712\u0720). The name seems to derive from GB (\ud802\udd02\ud802\udd01, \"well\") and \u02beL (\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd0b, \"god\"), the latter a word that could variously refer to any of the Canaanite gods or to their leader in particular. The name thus seems to have meant the \"Well of the God\" or \"Source of the God\".\nIts present Arabic name Jibayl (\u062c\u0628\u064a\u0644) or Jbeil (Lebanese pronunciation [\u0292be:l]) is a direct descendant of these earlier names, although apparently modified by a misunderstanding of the name as the triliteral root GBL or JBL, meaning \"mountain\". When the Arabic form of the name is used, it is typically rendered '''Jbeil''', '''Jbail''', or '''Jbayl''' in English. All of these, along with Byblos, are etymologically related. During the Crusades, this name appeared in European records as \"Gibelet\" and \"Giblet\". This name was used for Byblos Castle and its associated lordship.\nThe Phoenician city, known to the Greeks as B\u00fdblos (\u0392\u03cd\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) and to the Romans as Byblus, was important for their import of papyrus from Egypt. The English word \"Bible\", ultimately deriving from the Greek words b\u00edblos (\u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) and bibl\u00edon (\u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03bd), may have originated with the Greeks' mispronunciation of the city or its Egyptian export.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nByblos is located about 42 km (26 mi) north of Beirut. It is attractive to archaeologists because of the successive layers of debris resulting from centuries of human habitation. It was first excavated by Ernest Renan in 1860, as published in his Mission de Ph\u00e9nicie (1865\u20131874), then by Pierre Montet from 1921 until 1924, followed by Maurice Dunand from 1925 over a period of forty years. Renan's expedition was to \"provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos\"The site first appears to have been settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, approximately 8800 to 7000 BC. Neolithic remains of some buildings can be observed at the site. According to the writer Philo of Byblos (quoting Sanchuniathon, and quoted in Eusebius), Byblos had the reputation of being the oldest city in the world, founded by Cronus.  During the 3rd millennium BC, the first signs of a town can be observed, with the remains of well-built houses of uniform size.  This was the period when the Canaanite civilization began to develop.\n\n\n=== Neolithic and Chalcolithic levels ===\nJacques Cauvin published studies of flint tools from the stratified Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in 1962. Remains of humans found in Chalcolithic burials have been published by Henri Victor Vallois in 1937. Tombs from this era were discussed by Emir Maurice Chehab in 1950. Early pottery found at the tell was published by E.S. Boynton in 1960 with further studies by R. Erich in 1954 and Van Liere and Henri de Contenson in 1964.\n\n\n==== Five levels stratigraphy ====\nPrehistoric settlements at Byblos were divided up by Dunand into the following five periods, which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by Yosef Garfinkel to correlate with Tell es-Sultan (Jericho):\n\nEarly Neolithic (Early Phase) corresponding to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) of Jericho, represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology, dated between 8800 and 7000 BC;\nEarly Neolithic (Late Phase) corresponding to the PNA of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) IX (also Yarmukian) between 6400 and 5800 BC represented by pottery, sickle blades, figurines and small points, dated between 6400 and 5800 BC;\nMiddle Neolithic corresponding to the PNB of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) VIII and represented by pottery, dated between 5800 and 5300 BC;\nLate Neolithic corresponding to the Middle Chalcolithic of Beth Shean and represented by pottery, stone vessels, silos, chamber tombs and seals, dated between 5300 and 4500 BC;\nEarly Chalcolithic corresponding to the Late Chalcolithic of Ghassulian, represented by jar burials, pierced flint, churn and a violin figurine, dated to between 4500 and 3600 BC and,\nLate Chalcolithic corresponding to the Early Bronze Age, represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions, dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC.The Early Neolithic was a later settlement than others in the Beqaa Valley such as Labweh and Ard Tlaili. It was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient Byblos, with a watered valley in between.The original site spread down into the valley and covered an area of 1.2 ha (3.0 acres) providing fertile soils and a protected landing place for boats. Dunand discovered around twenty houses although some of the settlement was suggested to have been lost to the sea, robbed or destroyed. Dwellings were rectangular with plastered floors, pottery was usually Dark faced burnished ware with some shell impressions.The Middle Neolithic was a smaller settlement of no more than 0.15 ha (0.37 acres) adjacent to the older site. The pottery was more developed with red washes and more varied forms and elaborate decorations, buildings were poorer with unplastered floors.\nThe Late Neolithic period showed development from the middle in building design, a wider range of more developed flint tools and a far larger variety of pottery with fabrication including silica. The Late Chalcolithic featured developments of \"Canaanean blades\" and fan scrapers. Adult burials in jars started to appear along with metal in the form of one copper hook, found in a jar. Some jars were lined with white plaster that was applied and self-hardened after firing. Copper appeared more frequently in the Late Chalcolithic period along with multiple burials in tombs and jar handles with impressed signs. Early Bronze Age remains were characterized by the development of Byblos combed ware and a lithic assemblage studied by Jacques Cauvin.According to Lorenzo Nigro, Byblos moved from being a fishermen's village to its earlier urban form at the beginning of the third millennium BC. Fragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Homeric Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon say Byblos was the first city erected in Phoenicia and was established by the god Cronus. (Cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the Canaanite Baal or Baal Hammon in the syncretizing system used by the ancient Greeks and Romans.)\n\n\n=== Egyptian period ===\nWatson Mills and Roger Bullard suggest that during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, Byblos was virtually an Egyptian colony. The growing city was evidently a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally (among \"those who are on his waters\") of Egypt for many centuries. First Dynasty tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \"Byblos ship\".  Archaeologists have recovered Egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the Second dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy, although this \"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\". Objects have been found at Byblos naming the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king Neferhotep I, and the rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.\nAround 1350 BC, the Amarna letters include 60 letters from Rib-Hadda and his successor Ili-Rapih who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from Akhenaten. They also deal with the conquest of neighboring city-states by the Habiru.\nIt appears Egyptian contact peaked during the 19th dynasty, only to decline during the 20th and 21st dynasties. In addition, when the New Kingdom collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia.  Although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, it is clear after the Third Intermediate Period the Egyptians started favoring Tyre and Sidon instead of Byblos.Archaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five Byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200\u20131000 BC, shows existence of a Phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters; an important example is the Ahiram sarcophagus. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the Temple of the Obelisks, dedicated to the Canaanite war god Resheph, but this had fallen into ruins by the time of Alexander the Great.\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nIn the Assyrian period, Sibittibaal of Byblos became tributary to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when Sennacherib conquered all Phoenicia, the king of Byblos was Urumilki.  Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (r. 681\u2013669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 668\u2013627 BC), under its own kings Milkiasaph and Yehawmelek.\nIn the Achaemenid Empire (538\u2013332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being Sidon, Tyre, and Arwad.\nHellenistic rule came with the arrival of Alexander the Great in the area in 332 BC. Coinage was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.\n\nDuring the Greco-Roman period, the temple of Resheph was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyre and Sidon, was a center for the cult of Adonis. In the 3rd century, a small but impressive theater was constructed.  With the rise of Christianity, a bishopric was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly.  Although a Sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early Muslim conquests of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with Europe effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the First Crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Gibelet or Giblet.\n\n\n=== Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period ===\n\nIn the 12th and 13th century Byblos became part of the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state connected to, but largely independent from, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. As Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves  the Lordship of Gibelet. Their residence, the Crusader castle of Gibelet, along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by Saladin in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, conquered by Baibars in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300. Having voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture. Its fortifications were subsequently restored. From 1516 until 1918, the town and the whole region became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nByblos and all of Lebanon was placed under French Mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence.\nThe 2006 Lebanon War negatively affected the ancient city by covering its harbor and town walls with an oil slick that was the result of an oil spill from a nearby power-plant.  This however has been cleared and the coastal area has since then become a destination for beach goers, especially in the late spring and throughout the summer season.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nByblos's inhabitants are predominantly Christians, mostly Maronites, with minorities of Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholics. There is also a minority of Shia Muslims. It is said that the city of Bint Jbeil (\"Daughter of Byblos\") in southern Lebanon was founded by those Shia Muslims. Byblos has three representatives in the Parliament of Lebanon: two Maronites and one Shia.\n\n\n== Education ==\nByblos is home to the professional schools of the Lebanese American University (LAU). The LAU Byblos Campus houses the Medical School, the Engineering School, the School of Architecture and Design, the only US-accredited Pharmacy School in the Middle East,, the School of Business, and the School of Arts and Sciences. The Campus is situated on a hill overlooking the city and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nByblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub.  With its ancient port, Phoenician, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were regular visitors to the city.\nByblos was crowned as the \"Arab Tour Capital\" for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in Beirut.\nByblos was chosen by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler as the second best city in the Middle East for 2012, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai, and by the World Tourism Organization as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.\n\n\n== The Byblos archaeological site ==\nAin el-Malik or King\u2019s Spring, about 20 m deep, is a large cavity accessible by spiral stairs. Once it supplied the city with water. According to Plutarch\u2019s version of the Egyptian Osiris myth, the king\u2019s servants met Isis on the stairs of the spring and took her to the royal palace, where she found the body of her husband Osiris embedded in one of the palace pillars.\nThe L-shaped Temple was erected about 2700 BC.\nThe Temple of the Obelisks, originally built in 1600\u20131200 BC on top of the \u201cL-shaped temple,\u201d was moved by archaeologists to its present location. The many small obelisks found in this temple were used as religious offerings. The sanctuary contained a large number of human figurines made of bronze covered with gold leaf, which are now displayed in the National Museum of Beirut.\nThe necropolis dates back to the second millennium BC and contains tombs of the Byblos kings, including King Ahiram.\nThe Roman theater was built around AD 218.\n\n\n== Other historic buildings ==\nByblos Wax Museum\nThe Byblos Wax Museum displays wax statues of characters whose dates of origin range from Phoenician times to current days.\n\nByblos Fossil Museum\nThe Byblos Fossil Museum has a collection of fossilized fish, sharks, eel, flying fish, and other marine life, some of which are millions of years old.\n\nMedieval city wallThe old medieval part of Byblos is surrounded by walls running about 270m from east to west and 200m from north to south.\n\nByblos Castle\nByblos Castle was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century. It is located in the archaeological site near the port.\n\nSt John the Baptist ChurchWork on the church started during the Crusades in 1116. It was considered a cathedral and was partially destroyed during an earthquake in 1176 AD. When Islamic forces captured the city, it was transformed into a set of stables. It was later given to the Maronites as a gift by Prince Youssef Chehab of Lebanon in the mid-1700s, after they aided him in capturing the city.\n\nSultan Abdul Majid MosqueThe old mosque by the Castle dates back to Mamlouk times in mid 1600, and adopted the name of Sultan Abdul Majid after he renovated it.\n\nHistoric Quarter and SouksIn the southeast section of the historic city, near the entrance of the archaeological site, is an old market where tourists can shop for souvenirs and antiques, or simply stroll along the old cobblestone streets and enjoy the architecture.\n\nByblos International Festival\nThis summer music festival is an annual event that takes place in the historic quarter.\n\nTemple of Baalat Gebal\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTwin towns \u2013 sister citiesByblos is twinned  with:\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJid\u00e9jian, Nina (1968).

It is the city's oldest extant church: it has been built over the disappeared Anastasi Romano-Byzantine Cathedral.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe establishment of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Beirut is attributed according to the Greek Orthodox tradition to the Apostle Quartus of Berytus, one of the Seventy disciples, who served as Beirut's first bishop. Byzantine emperor Theodosius II issued a decree c.\u2009449 \u2013 c.\u2009450 AD elevating the bishop of Beirut Efstathius to the rank of Metropolitan bishop. The city was until then a diocese of the Metropolis of Tyre.The Anastasis cathedral was the first church to be built on the site of the Saint George cathedral. It was built by Efstathuis in the fifth century AD and bordered the auditoria of Beirut's Roman law school. The church influenced the teachings of the school as law scholars worked to reconcile the texts of Roman law and the teachings of Christianity as attested by Severus of Antioch, who visited the city in the fifth century AD.In 551 AD a massive earthquake destroyed the whole of Beirut including the \"Anastasis cathedral\". In the 12th century a cathedral was built in the same location. The structure was badly damaged by a 1759 earthquake and was pulled down to be built anew. Construction started in 1764 and the new, larger structure, with one nave and a vaulted ceiling, was completed in 1767. However, the ceiling collapsed killing 90 people, due to the lack of supporting pillars. In 1772 the church was rebuilt on a cruciform plan with three naves, a new portico was added to the north facade, the main western facade was enlarged and a new bell-tower was built on the north-western corner.In 1783 the cathedral underwent a series of modifications, including the addition of the narthex to the western facade and the enlargement of the apse to fit the central axis of the cathedral's main altar. That same year Younes al-Jbeily offered the church its ornate gilded wooden iconostasis.The last modifications to the cathedral were made in 1910, with the addition of a vaulted portico to the south facade, the cathedral was further enlarged to the east and the bell tower was moved to the south-east corner. The interior of the cathedral was decorated with ornate frescoes offered by Ibrahim Youssef Saad.In 1975, following the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war, the cathedral was shelled and vandalized and its elaborate frescoes were left to decay. Most of the icons and part of the iconostasis were stolen; parts of the 18th century iconsostasis were also set on fire. The excavations undertaken under the cathedral during 17 months in 1994\u20131995 covered 316 square metres (3,400 sq ft) and revealed many archaeological layers that allowed a historical timeline of the church and its surroundings to be constructed. On 10 October 1995 Metropolitan Elias Audi announced plans to restore the war-torn cathedral. The first phase of restoration began in 1998, under the supervision of a committee headed by Ghassan Tueni. The cathedral reopened its doors on 15 December 2003.\n\n\n== The archaeological crypt museum ==\n\nIn 1994, archaeological excavations undertaken within and in the vicinity of the Saint George cathedral before the initiation of restoration works unveiled a number of artifacts and vestiges spanning the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Medieval and Ottoman eras. The aim of the excavation was to locate the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral in relation to the standing cathedral and ultimately triangulate the location of the ancient Law School of Beirut. The excavations also revealed the sequence of continuous religious use of the site. A committee was formed under the patronage of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Beirut to oversee the excavations and the creation of the Saint George archaeological crypt museum. The founding committee was headed by archaeologist Leila Bader who served as the director of the American University of Beirut Archaeological Museum and included Nabil Azar, Yasmine Macaron Bou Assaf, Katia Neeman Salha and Rita Kalindjian. The creation of the museum was funded by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Beirut with a donation from the Jacques and Naila Saad\u00e9 foundation. The museum was inaugurated on 3 December 2011.The museum consists of a crypt running under a part of the cathedral where visitors walk through 12 stops showcasing the different archaeological and historical layers. The museum has a surface area of 250 square metres (2,700 sq ft), it is accessible through a breach in the cathedral's foundation wall and a stairwell built in front of the church's northern side. Towards the end of the circuit, the crypt opens up to a glass partition giving views to the cathedral's altar.The display includes a number of finds such as oil lamps, smoking pipes, pottery, statuettes and Christian vessels and ornaments. Other vestiges kept in-situ include parts of the older churches' altars and apse, mosaics, stone engravings, tombstones and columns, some of which belong to the old city's Cardo maximus.The excavated area also includes a necropolis where 25 burials were opened. The tombs were oriented on an east-west axis, with the head facing west. These graves consisted of a single sandstone course overlaid by large stone slabs. A large quantity of iron nails were uncovered in the necropolis suggesting the use of wooden coffins in the funeral customs. Among the uncovered tombs was a one containing the skeleton of a man wearing a bronze tiara, with an iron arrowhead and three bronze amulets placed over his chest.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeirut Central District\nEastern Orthodox Church\nEastern Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon\nChristianity in Lebanon\nSaint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut\nSayyidat al-Nouriyyeh\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Moussa Castle is a castle between Deir el Qamar and Beit ed-Dine in Lebanon.\n\nIt is the life work of a Lebanese visionary, requiring 60 years of dedicated hard-work to finish.Moussa's castle was built on a hill between Deir El Kamar and Beiteddine - Lebanon, with the beliefs and ideas of its builder engraved on its stones. The castle was built by Moussa Abdel Karim Al Maamari who was born on July 27, 1931, in the village of Harat Al Saraya - Lebanon and died January 31, 2018, in the village Deir El Qamar. His idea of building a castle began when he was only 14 years old, inspired by the Middle Ages.\nRidiculed by his teacher \"Anwar\" and mocked by his classmates, he left school and travelled to Saida on foot where he worked with his uncle on restoring Saida's fortress. He was later assigned by the Emir Maurice Chehab to renovate the castles and to excavate for archaeological discoveries to be exhibited in the National Museum of Beirut in 1947. He continued working in the same field gaining enough experience from his work in restoring castles. He was then transferred to Beiteddine palace, where he restored the museum of Emir Bashir Chehabi II; he supervised the work as well as the placing of the Emir's weapons collection, clothes and jewelry, and the sword offered to him by Napoleon in the museum that was inaugurated under the rule of late president Beshara Khalil Al Khoury in September 1951. It was then that he began work on his own construction and bought a suitable piece of land. The foundation stone was laid in 1962, and completed with the help of his wife.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMoussa Castle official website",

          "A lot of history and culture everywhere. Around it is a beautiful scenery of mountains and greenery.",
          "Every stone of this 3-story medieval castle was individually hand-crafted by Moussa. The castle exhibits artifacts, clothing, antique weapons, and more. You can see wax sculptures act out scenes from a typical 19th-century Lebanese village life. I highly recommend this place",
          "There is an interesting story behind this castle. The entrance fee was a little pricy but we found it worth it. Lots of depiction of lebanese culture.",

          "Interesting for some history. Too much weapons.... Becoming a weapons museum. Lots of dust everywhere!",

          "Not worth the entrance fee! We made a day trip out of visiting this castle along with Beitadein palace nearby. The Mousa castle is great if you like man made quaint mannequins doing everyday things. It is amazing that one man made all of the stuff inside, but isn't my cup of",
          "There are lots of animatronics showing you how life was in Lebanon through the years. It's a bit dusty and cheesy but it was fun. It's much bigger than it looks from the outside and you follow through the different hallways down two levels. There was a gentleman playing Lebanese",
          "Castle is nothing to brag about nor is the story of the man who built. Staff was stand offish and the bathroom was filthy and stinking of very bad odor. Would not recommend.",
          "This castle looks small outside but when you go inside, you will be surprise on how big it is. There are thousands maybe tens of thousand displays. There are guns, ax, knife, swords, jewelries, life size figures. This place is really interesting. This is a must visit place if",

          "This is an odd attraction. We walked in on a quiet day, and the curator quickly switched on all the lights and exhibits. The back story is very quirky and sweet, and the waxworks can look a little creepy at times. The collection of weaponry is second to none though, and",

          "I was really disappointed about this place, it is a complete farce. You get inside the castle and you walk through several rooms full of ridiculous and ugly puppets which should personify the life stile of an ancient period, but as per our opinion, the target has been totally",

          "This is the embodiment of middle eastern stubbornness! Apparently the whole museum and house was built by one man who was ridiculed by many that he would not be able to accomplish this feat, and instead has built a landmark in Lebanon! The entire museum is based on his wax",

        "wiki": "Split (, as the English word split; Croatian pronunciation: [spl\u00eet] (listen); see other names) is the second-largest city of Croatia and the largest city of the region of Dalmatia, with about 250,000 people living in its urban area. It lies on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea and is spread over a central peninsula and its surroundings. An intraregional transport hub and popular tourist destination, the city is linked to the Adriatic islands and the Apennine peninsula. \nThe city was founded as the Greek colony of Asp\u00e1lathos (A\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2) in the 3rd or 2nd century BC and later on was home to Diocletian's Palace, built for the Roman emperor in AD 305. It became a prominent settlement around 650 when it succeeded the ancient capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, Salona. After the sack of Salona by the Avars and Slavs, the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by Roman refugees. Split became a Byzantine city. Later it drifted into the sphere of the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Croatia, with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty. For much of the High and Late Middle Ages, Split enjoyed autonomy as a free city of the Dalmatian city-states, caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and Croatia (in union with Hungary) for control over the Dalmatian cities.\nVenice eventually prevailed and during the early modern period Split remained a Venetian city, a heavily fortified outpost surrounded by Ottoman territory. Its hinterland was won from the Ottomans in the Morean War of 1699, and in 1797, as Venice fell to Napoleon, the Treaty of Campo Formio rendered the city to the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1805, the Peace of Pressburg added it to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and in 1806 it was included in the French Empire, becoming part of the Illyrian Provinces in 1809. After being occupied in 1813, it was eventually granted to the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna, where the city remained a part of the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia until the fall of Austria-Hungary in 1918 and the formation of Yugoslavia. In World War II, the city was annexed by Italy, then liberated by the Partisans after the Italian capitulation in 1943. It was then re-occupied by Germany, which granted it to its puppet Independent State of Croatia. The city was liberated again by the Partisans in 1944, and was included in the post-war Socialist Yugoslavia, as part of its republic of Croatia. In 1991, Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia amid the Croatian War of Independence.\n\n\n== Name ==\nBy a popular theory, the city draws its name from the spiny broom (Calicotome spinosa, \u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 in Greek), after which the Greek colony of Asp\u00e1lathos (A\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2) or Sp\u00e1lathos (\u03a3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2) was named. The theory is dubious as it is Spanish broom (Spartium junceum, brnistra or \u017euka in Croatian) that is a very frequent plant in the area. Nevertheless, given that they are similar flowers, it is understandable how the confusion arose.\nAs the city became a Roman possession, the Latin name became Spalatum or Aspalatum, which in the Middle Ages evolved into Aspalathum, Spalathum, Spalatrum, and Spalatro in the Dalmatian language of the city's Romance population. The Croatian term became Split or Spljet, while the Italian-language version, Spalato, became universal in international usage by the Early Modern Period. In the late 19th century, the Croatian name increasingly came to prominence, and officially replaced Spalato in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I.\nFor a significant period, the origin of the name was erroneously thought to be related to the Latin word for \"palace\" (palatium), a reference to Diocletian's Palace which still forms the core of the city. Various theories were developed, such as the notion that the name derives from S. Palatium, an abbreviation of Salonae Palatium. The erroneous \"palace\" etymologies were notably due to Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, and were later mentioned by Thomas the Archdeacon. The city, however, is several centuries older than the palace.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAlthough the beginnings of Split are traditionally associated with the construction of Diocletian's Palace in 305, the city was founded several centuries earlier as the Greek colony of Asp\u00e1lathos, or Sp\u00e1lathos. It was a colony of the polis of Issa, the modern-day town of Vis, itself a colony of the Sicilian city of Syracuse.  The exact year the city was founded is not known, but it is estimated to have been in the 3rd or 2nd century BC.\nThe Greek settlement lived off trade with the surrounding Illyrian tribes, mostly the Delmatae.After the Illyrian Wars of 229 and 219 BC, the city of Salona, only a short distance from Sp\u00e1lathos, became the capital of the Roman Province of Dalmatia and one of the largest cities of the late empire with 60.000 people. The history of Sp\u00e1lathos becomes obscure for a while at this point, being overshadowed by that of nearby Salona, to which it would later become successor. The Roman Emperor Diocletian (ruled AD 284 to 305) in 293 began the construction of an opulent and heavily fortified palace fronting the sea, near his home town of Salona, selecting the site of Sp\u00e1lathos (or Spalatum in Latin).\nThe Palace was built as a massive structure, much like a Roman military fortress. The palace and the city of Spalatum which formed its surroundings were at times inhabited by a population as large as 8,000 to 10,000 people.Between 475 and 480 the Palace hosted Flavius Julius Nepos, the last recognised Emperor of the Western Roman Empire. Salona was lost to the Ostrogothic Kingdom in 493, along with most of Dalmatia, but the Emperor Justinian I regained Dalmatia in 535\u2013536.\n\nThe Pannonian Avars sacked and destroyed Salona in 639; the surviving Romans fled to the nearby islands. The Dalmatian region and its shores were at this time settled by tribes of Croats, a South Slavic people subservient to the Avar khagans.\nThe Salonitans regained the land under Severus the Great in 650 and settled the 300-year-old Palace of Diocletian, which could not be effectively besieged by the Slavic tribes of the mainland. The Emperor Constans II granted them an Imperial mandate to establish themselves in the Palace as the City of Spalatum, which imposed upon the Croatian Slavs - at the time alied of Byzantium against the Avars - a cessation of hostilities. The Temple of Jupiter was rededicated to the Virgin Mary and the remains of the popular Saint Domnius were recovered from the ruins of Salona, later establishing the Cathedral of Saint Domnius as new seat of the Archbishop of Salona. In 1100, the bell tower which became the main symbol of the city was constructed and dedicated to Saint Domnius, by then regarded as the patron saint of the city.\n\n\n=== Byzantine and Hungarian period ===\n\nUntil the Sack of Constantinople, Split remained a de jure possession of the Byzantine Empire as a Byzantine duchy, administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna and after 751 by  Jadera (Zadar).\nIts hinterland, however, was now home to the Duchy of the Croats. In this period, an independent Dalmatian language developed from Latin, with a distinct local dialect: to its inhabitants, the city became known as Spalatrum or Spalatro, one of the main Dalmatian city-states.\nIn 925 Tomislav's Kingdom of Croatia emerged in the hinterland of the city, centered in Nin as an ally of Byzantium against Simeon I of Bulgaria - though without receiving any power from the Emperor over the Dalmatian cities. The rise of the rival Bishopric of Nin, headed by Bishop Gregory, which attempted to institute the \"Slavonic\" or \"Slavic language\" as the language of religious service, led to the 925 Synod of Split, at which it was decreed that \"no one should presume to celebrate the divine mysteries in the Slavonic language, but only in Latin and Greek, and that no one of that tongue should be advanced to the holy orders\". \n\nThroughout the 9th and 10th centuries, Split was raided by the Narentines (a South Slavic confederation recognizing the King of Croatia as their sovereign). Therefore, the city offered its allegiance to Venice and in 998 the Venetian Doge Pietro II Orseolo, led a large naval expedition which defeated the Narentines the same year. After obtaining permission from Emperor Basil II in Constantinople, Orseolo proclaimed himself Duke of Dalmatia.\nIn 1019 the Byzantine Empire restored direct control over Dalmatia. The title \"Duke of Dalmatia\" seems to have been dropped at this point by the Venetian doges. In 1069 Peter Kre\u0161imir IV, King of Croatia, gained control over Dalmatian islands and cities, including Split, and stretched his rule south to Neretva. The coastal cities retained autonomous administration and were still nominally under Byzantine Empire, but were now subjects of the Croatian king.After the death of Croatian King Stephen II in 1091, a period of succession crisis followed in Croatia, with King Ladislaus I of Hungary interfering in it. Byzantine Emperor Alexius took advantage of this and joined the old Theme of Dalmatia to the Empire. In 1096 Emperor Alexius, at the time engaged in the First Crusade, granted the administration of Dalmatia to the Doge of Venice.In 1105 Coloman, King of Hungary, having conquered the Kingdom of Croatia, reneged on its alliance with Venice and moved on the coastal towns, besieging and taking Zadar. Split and Trogir decided then to surrender upon guarantee of their ancient privileges.\nThe rights granted to the city (and reaffirmed by new charters) were substantial. Split was to pay no tribute, it was to choose its own count and archbishop whom the king would confirm, it preserved its old Roman laws, and appointed its own judge. Dues from trade (which were substantial in the period), were divided between the count, the archbishop, and the king, and no foreigner was to live within the walls of the city against the will of the citizens. These rights were generally upheld by Hungarian kings, but there were inevitable incidents of violation.\nAfter Coloman's death 1116, the Doge Ordelafo Faliero returned from Outremer and retook all the Dalmatian cities, and also, for the first time, the Croatian cities of coast such as Biograd and \u0160ibenik. In 1117, however, he was defeated and killed in renewed battle with the Hungarians under Stephen II of Hungary, and Split again acknowledged Hungarian rule. But the new Doge, Domenico Michele, quickly defeated the Hungarians again and restored Venetian authority by 1118. In 1124, while the Doge was engaged against the Byzantine Empire (now hostile to Venice), Stephen II recovered Split and Trogir without resistance. Upon Michele's return in 1127, however, the Doge yet again expelled the Hungarians from the two cities and utterly destroyed Biograd, the favored seat of the Croatian Kings that the Hungarians were attempting to establish as a rival to the Venetian Zadar.The cities remained in Venetian hands without contest during the reign of B\u00e9la II. But in 1141, his successor, King G\u00e9za II, having conquered Bosnian lands, marched to Split and Trogir, both voluntarily accepting him as overlord. This turned out to be a definitive conquest, as Venetian rule was not to return to Split for another 186 years.\nIn that period, however, Split was to see one brief (and final) restoration of Imperial power in Dalmatia. The Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus began his campaigns against the Kingdom of Croatia and Hungary in 1151, and by 1164, had secured the submission of the Dalmatian cities back under Imperial rule. Having won a decisive victory against Kingdom of Croatia and Hungary in 1167 at the Battle of Sirmium, consolidating his gains, the Emperor suddenly broke with Venice as well, and sent a fleet of 150 ships to the Adriatic. Split was to remain in Byzantine hands until Manuel's death in 1180, when B\u00e9la III of Hungary moved to restore Hungarian power in Dalmatia. The city remained loyal to the Empire, resisting the re-establishment of Hungarian rule, and consequently, upon its inevitable submission, was punished with the King's refusal to renew its ancient privileges.During the 20-year Hungarian civil war between King Sigismund and the Capetian House of Anjou of the Kingdom of Naples, the losing contender, Ladislaus of Naples, sold his disputed rights on Dalmatia to the Venetian Republic for 100,000 ducats. Acting on the pretext, the Republic took over in the city by the year 1420.\n\n\n=== Venetian period ===\n\nBy this time the population was largely Croatian, while Romance Dalmatian names were not as common, according to the Medieval city archives. The common language was Croatian, but Italian (a mixture of Tuscan and Venetian dialects) was also spoken due to Italian notaries, school teachers and merchants. The city's autonomy was greatly reduced: the highest authority was a prince and captain (conte e capitanio), assigned by Venice.Split eventually developed into a significant port-city, with important trade routes to the Ottoman-held interior through the nearby Klis pass. Culture flourished as well, Split being the hometown of Marko Maruli\u0107, a classic Croatian author. Maruli\u0107's most acclaimed work, Judita (1501), was an epic poem about Judith and Holfernes, widely held to be the first modern work of Croatian literature. It was written in Split and printed in Venice in 1521. The advances and achievements were reserved mostly for the aristocracy: the illiteracy rate was extremely high, mostly because Venetian rule showed little interest in educational and medical facilities.In 1797 Split was ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy by the Treaty of Campo Formio, ending 377 years of Venetian rule in the city.\n\n\n=== Napoleonic wars ===\nSplit became part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1805, after the defeat of the Third Coalition at the Battle of Austerlitz and the consequent Treaty of Pressburg. It was included directly in the French Empire in 1806. The same year, Vincenzo Dandolo was named provveditore generale and general Auguste de Marmont was named military commander of Dalmatia.In 1809, after a brief war with France, Austria ceded Carinthia, Carniola, Croatia west of the Sava River, Gorizia and Trieste to France. These territories, along with Dalmatia, formed the Illyrian Provinces. During this period, large investments were undertaken in the city, new streets were built and parts of the ancient fortifications were removed.\nAustria, with help from a British force led by Captain William Hoste, occupied Split in November 1813. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the city was officially ceded to Austria.\n\n\n=== Under Habsburg rule ===\n\nThe Split region became part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia, a separate administrative unit. After the revolutions of 1848 as a result of the romantic nationalism, two factions appeared. One was the pro-Croatian Unionist faction (later called the \"Puntari\", \"Pointers\"), led by the People's Party and, to a lesser extent, the Party of Rights, both of which advocated the union of Dalmatia with the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia which was under Hungarian administration. This faction was strongest in Split, and used it as its headquarters. The other faction was the pro-Italian Autonomist faction (also known as the \"Irredentist\" faction), whose political goals varied from autonomy within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to a political union with the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe political alliances in Split shifted over time. At first, the Unionists and Autonomists were allied against the centralism of Vienna. After a while, when the national question came to prominence, they separated. Under Austria, however, Split can generally be said to have stagnated. The great upheavals in Europe in 1848 gained no ground in Split, and the city did not rebel.\nAntonio Bajamonti became Mayor of Split in 1860 and \u2013 except for a brief interruption during the period 1864\u201365 \u2013 held the post for over two decades until 1880. Bajamonti was also a member of the Dalmatian Sabor (1861\u201391) and the Austrian Chamber of Deputies (1867\u201370 and 1873\u201379). In 1882 Bajamonti's party lost the elections and Dujam Rendi\u0107-Mio\u010devi\u0107, a prominent city lawyer, was elected to the post.\n\n\n=== As part of Yugoslavia ===\n\n\n==== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ====\nAfter the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the province of Dalmatia, along with Split, became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Split was the site of a series of incidents between 1918 and 1920.\nSince Rijeka, Trieste and Zadar, the three other large cities on the eastern Adriatic coast, were annexed by Italy, Split became the most important port in the Kingdom. The Lika railway, connecting Split to the rest of the country, was completed in 1925.\nThe country changed its name to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, and the Port of Split became the seat of new administrative unit, Littoral Banovina. After the Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek agreement, Split became the part of new administrative unit (merging of Sava and Littoral Banovina plus some Croat populated areas), Banovina of Croatia in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nIn April 1941, following the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, Split was occupied by Italy. Although Split formally became part of the Independent State of Croatia, the Usta\u0161e were not able to establish and strengthen their rule in Split, as Italians assumed all power in Dalmatia. One month later on 18 May 1941, when the Treaties of Rome were signed, Italy formally annexed Split and large parts of Dalmatia down to Kotor. The Dalmatian Governatorate hosted 390,000 inhabitants, of which 280,000 Croats, 90,000 Serbs and 5,000 Italians. \nItalian rule met heavy opposition from the Croat population as Split became a centre of anti-fascist sentiment in Yugoslavia. The first armed resistance group was organized on 7 May 1941; the 63 member strong 1st Strike Detachment (Prvi udarni odred) served as the basis for future formations, including the 1st Split Partisan Detachment. Between September and October 1941 alone, ten officials of the Italian fascist occupation were assassinated by the citizens. \nOn 12 June 1942, a mob, which included Italian soldiers, devastated the city's synagogue, attacked the Jews inside, and looted sixty Jewish homes.\nThe local football clubs refused to compete in the Italian championship; HNK Hajduk and RNK Split suspended their activities and both joined the Partisans along with their entire staff after the Italian capitulation provided the opportunity. Soon after Hajduk became the official football club of the Partisan movement.\nIn September 1943, following the capitulation of Italy, the city was temporarily controlled by Tito's brigades with thousands of people volunteering to join the Partisans of Marshal Josip Broz Tito (a third of the total population, according to some sources). 8,000 Italian soldiers from the 15th Infantry Division Bergamo prepared to fight alongside the Yugoslav Partisans against the Waffen SS Prinz Eugen. The Italian General Becuzzi handed over to the Partisans 11 soldiers which they considered as \"war criminals; the Partisans also executed up to 41 members of the Italian Police forces, later found in mass graves.A few weeks later, however, the Partisans were forced into retreat as the Wehrmacht placed the city under the authority of the Independent State of Croatia. The Germans decimated the Italian soldiers as traitors, including three Generals (Policardi, Pelligra e Cigala Fulgosi) and 48 officials (Trelj massacre). In this period the last remaining symbols of Italian heritage in Split, including several Venetian Lions of St.Mark, were erased from the town.\nIn a tragic turn of events, besides being bombed by axis forces, the city was also bombed by the Allies, causing hundreds of deaths. Partisans finally captured the city on 26 October 1944 and instituted it as the provisional capital of Croatia. On 12 February 1945 the Kriegsmarine conducted a daring raid on the Split harbour, damaging the British cruiser Delhi.\nAfter the war the remaining members of the Italian community in Split left Yugoslavia towards Italy (Istrian-Dalmatian exodus).\n\n\n==== Federal Yugoslavia ====\n\nAfter World War II, Split became a part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, itself a constituent sovereign republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the period the city experienced its largest economic and demographic boom. Dozens of new factories and companies were founded with the city population tripling during the period. The city became the economic centre of an area exceeding the borders of Croatia and was flooded by waves of rural migrants from the undeveloped hinterland who found employment in the newly established industry, as part of large-scale industrialization and investment by the Yugoslav Federal Government.The shipbuilding industry was particularly successful and Yugoslavia, with its Croatian shipyards, became one of the world's top nations in the field. Many recreational facilities were also constructed with federal funding, especially for the 1979 Mediterranean Games, such as the Poljud Stadium. The city also became the largest passenger and military port in Yugoslavia, housing the headquarters of the Yugoslav Navy (Jugoslavenska ratna mornarica, JRM) and the Army's Coastal Military District (equivalent of a field army). In the period between 1945 and 1990, the city was transformed and expanded, taking up the vast majority of the Split peninsula. In the same period it achieved an as yet unsurpassed GDP and employment level, still above the present day's, growing into a significant Yugoslav city.\n\n\n=== Since independence ===\n\nWhen Croatia declared its independence again in 1991, Split had a large garrison of JNA troops (drafted from all over Yugoslavia), as well as the headquarters and facilities of the Yugoslav War Navy (JRM). This led to a tense months-long stand-off between the JNA and Croatian National Guard and police forces, occasionally flaring up in various incidents.\nThe most tragic such incident occurred on 15 November 1991, when the JRM light frigate Split fired a small number of shells at the city and its surroundings. The damage was insignificant but there were a few casualties. Three general locations were bombarded: the old city center, the city airport and an uninhabited part of the hills above Ka\u0161tela, between the airport and Split. JRM Sailors who had refused to attack Croat civilians, most of them Croats themselves, were left in the vessel's brig. The JNA and JRM evacuated all of its facilities in Split during January 1992. The 1990s economic recession soon followed.\nIn the years following 2000, Split finally gained momentum and started to develop again, with a focus on tourism. From being just a transition centre, Split is now a major Croatian tourist destination. Many new hotels are being built, as well as new apartment and office buildings. Many large development projects are revived, and new infrastructure is being built. An example of the latest large city projects is the Spaladium Arena, built in 2009.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSplit is situated on a peninsula between the eastern part of the Gulf of Ka\u0161tela and the Split Channel. The Marjan hill (178 metres (584 ft)), rises in the western part of the peninsula. The ridges Kozjak (779 metres (2,556 ft)) and its brother Mosor (1,339 metres (4,393 ft)) protect the city from the north and northeast, and separate it from the hinterland.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nSplit has a Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. It has hot, moderately dry summers and mild, wet winters, which can occasionally feel cold, because of the strong northern wind bura. Average annual rainfall is more than 820 mm (32.28 in). January is the coldest month, with an average low temperature around 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). November is the wettest month, with a precipitation total of nearly 113 mm (4.45 in) and 12 rainy days. July is the driest month, with a precipitation total of around 26 mm (1.02 in). Winter is the wettest season; however, it can rain in Split at any time of the year. Snow is usually rare; since record-keeping began the months of December and January have accrued 1 snowy day on average, while February has averaged 2. In February 2012, Split received unusually large amount of snow which caused major problems with traffic. Split receives more than 2,600 sunshine hours annually. July is the hottest month, with an average high temperature around 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). In July 2017 Croatian firefighters battled to control a forest fire along the Adriatic coast that damaged and destroyed buildings in villages around the city of Split.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2011 census, the city of Split had 178,102 inhabitants.\nEthnically, Croats make up 96.23% of the population, and 86.15% of the residents of the city are Roman Catholics.The settlements included in the administrative area of the City are:\nDonje Sitno, population 313\nGornje Sitno, population 392\nKamen, population 1,769\nSlatine, population 1,106\nSplit, population 167,121\nSrinjine, population 1,201\nStobre\u010d, population 4,978\n\u017drnovnica, population 3,222The wider urban area of Split has 293,298 inhabitants, while there are 346,314 people in the Split metropolitan area. The urban area includes the surrounding towns and settlements: Okrug, Seget, Trogir, Ka\u0161tela, Solin, Podstrana, Dugi Rat and Omi\u0161, while the metro area adds Marina, Primorski Dolac, Prgomet, Le\u0107evica, Klis, Dugopolje, Dicmo, Trilj and Sinj. The entire Split-Dalmatia County has 454,798 residents, and the whole region of Dalmatia just under a million.\n\n\n=== Inhabitants ===\n\nAlthough the inhabitants of Split (Spli\u0107ani) may appear to be a homogeneous body, they traditionally belong to three groups. The old urban families, the Fetivi, (short for \"Fetivi Spli\u0107ani\", \"real Split natives\") are generally very proud of their city, its history and its distinctive traditional speech (a variant of the Chakavian dialect). The Fetivi, now a distinct minority, are sometimes referred to (semi-derogatorily) as \"Mandrili\" - and are augmented by the so-called Boduli, immigrants from the nearby Adriatic islands who mostly arrived over the course of the 20th century.The above two groups are distinct, in the Mediterranean aspects of their ethnicity and traditional Chakavian speech, from the more numerous Shtokavian-speaking immigrants from the rural Zagora hinterland, referred to as the Vlaji (a term that sometimes carries negative connotations). The latter joined the Fetivi and Boduli as a third group in the decades since World War II, thronging the high-rise suburbs that stretch away from the centre. By now the Vlaji constitute a decided majority of inhabitants, causing a distinct shift in the overall ethnic characteristics of the city. Historically more influenced by Ottoman culture, their population merges almost seamlessly at the eastern border with the Herzegovinian Croats and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina in general. Local jokes have always condemned the Vlaji to playing the role of rural unsophisticates, although it is often conceded that it was their hard work in the industries of the post-WWII era that made modern-day Split what it is now.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSplit's economy is still suffering the backlash from the recession caused by the transfer to a market economy and privatization. In the Yugoslav era, however, the city had been a highly significant economic centre with a modern and diverse industrial and economic base, including shipbuilding, food, chemical, plastics, textile, and paper industry, in addition to large revenues from tourism. In 1981 Split's GDP per capita was 37% above the Yugoslav average. Today, most of the factories are out of business (or are far below pre-war production and employment capacity) and the city has been trying to concentrate on commerce and services, consequently leaving an alarmingly large number of factory workers unemployed.\nBrodosplit is the largest shipyard in Croatia. It employs around 2,300 people, and has built over 350 vessels, including many tankers, both panamax and non-panamax, as well as container ships, bulk carriers, dredgers, off-shore platforms, frigates, submarines, patrol boats and passenger ships. 80% of the ships built are exported to foreign contractors.\nThe new A1 motorway, integrating Split with the rest of the Croatian freeway network, has helped stimulate economic production and investment, with new businesses being built in the city centre and its wildly sprawling suburbs. The entire route was opened in July 2005. Today, the city's economy relies mostly on trade and tourism with some old industries undergoing partial revival, such as food (fishing, olive, wine production), paper, concrete and chemicals. Since 1998, Split has been host to the annual Croatia Boat Show.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThere are 24 primary schools and 23 secondary schools including 11 grammar schools.\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nThe University of Split (Croatian: Sveu\u010dili\u0161te u Splitu) was founded in 1974. In the last few years it has grown to a large extent. Now it has 26,000 students and is organized in 12 faculties. Currently the new campus is being built, and it will be finished before 2018. It will house all of the faculties, a large student centre with a sports hall, sporting grounds and a university library.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 1979, the historic center of Split was  included into  the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Split is said to be one of the centres of Croatian culture. Its literary tradition can be traced to medieval times, and includes names like Marko Maruli\u0107, while in more modern times Split excelled by authors famous for their sense of humor. Among them the most notable is Miljenko Smoje, famous for his TV series Malo misto and Velo misto, with the latter dealing with the development of Split into a modern city.\nDespite colorful settings and characters, as well as a cinema tradition that could be traced to early 20th-century works of Josip Karaman, there were relatively few films shot in or around Split. However, the city did produce several famous actors, most notably Boris Dvornik.\nAlso well known is Ivo Tijardovi\u0107, and his famous operetta \"Little Floramye\" (Mala Floramye). Both Smoje and Tijardovi\u0107 are famous artists thought to represent the old Split traditions that are slowly dying out due to the city being overwhelmed by large numbers of rural migrants from the undeveloped hinterland.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThe Archaeological Museum (Arheolo\u0161ki muzej) main collection is housed at Zrinsko-Frankopanska 25 in Split. There is also a branch building in Solin (Salona and Tusculum Collection) and two regional centres at Vid near Metkovi\u0107 (Narona Collection), and on the island of Vis (Issa Collection). The Split Archaeological Museum is the oldest museum institution in Croatia, founded in 1820 by the decree of the Dalmatian government in Zadar. Some 150,000 artifacts cover prehistoric times, the period of Greek colonization of the Adriatic, Roman Provincial and Early Christian era to the early Middle Ages and the period of Croatian popular rulers). Of special interest is the collection of stone inscriptions from Salona and the collections of Graeco-Hellenistic ceramic objects, Roman glass, ancient clay lamps, bone and metal articles, as well as the collection of gems. In addition, the museum houses an extensive collection of ancient and medieval coins, a submarine archaeological collection, and a rich archive library.The Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments (Croatian: Muzej hrvatskih arheolo\u0161kih spomenika) is the only museum in Croatia dedicated to researching and presenting cultural artifacts of the Croats in the Middle Ages, between the 7th and 15th centuries, particularly the time of the early medieval Croatian state from 9th to 12th century. The collection of early medieval wicker, clay figurines, and old Croatian Latin epigraphic monuments is the largest collection of its kind in Europe.The Split City Museum (Croatian: Muzej Grada Splita) at Papali\u0107eva 1, is housed in the former Papali\u0107 Palace. The collection presents the urban, cultural, artistic and economic  heritage of the city. The museum is also home to the Emanuel Vidovi\u0107 Gallery, dedicated to the most important Split painter of the 20th century.The Ethnographical Museum (Croatian: Etnografski muzej) at Severova 1, has a wide range of  ethnographic content mainly from Dalmatia. Founded in 1910, the museum collects original and contemporary applications of traditional heritage. They also track contemporary popular culture living with traces of old foundations and preserve and promote the value of folk heritage, renewing them and presenting exhibitions.The Croatian Maritime Museum  (Croatian: Hrvatski pomorski muzej) at Glagolja\u0161ka 18 \u2013 Tvr\u0111ava Gripe has a collection of marine equipment and supplies, weapons and navigation equipment, medals, ship models, uniforms and equipment, and related artwork. A permanent exhibition is planned to complete the presentation of military maritime and naval history, with a presentation that covers the period from the arrival of the Slavs to the present day.Split Science museum and Zoo  (Croatian: Prirodoslovni muzej i zoolo\u0161ki vrt) located at Kolombatovi\u0107evo \u0161etali\u0161te 2 on the Marjan hill peninsula.The Gallery of Fine Arts (Croatian: Galerija umjetnina), located at Kralja Tomislava 15, is an art museum that contains works from the 14th century to the present day providing an overview of the artistic developments in the local art scene. The gallery was founded in 1931, and has a permanent exhibition of paintings and sculptures that includes works by major Croatian artists such as Vlaho Bukovac, Mato Celestin Medovi\u0107, Branislav De\u0161kovi\u0107, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, Emanuel Vidovi\u0107 and Ignjat Job. The gallery also has an extensive collection of icons, and holds special exhibits of works by contemporary artists. In May 2009, the gallery opened its new premises in the old Split Hospital building behind Diocletian's Palace.The Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Gallery  (Croatian: Galerija Me\u0161trovi\u0107), on the Marjan peninsula is an art museum  dedicated to the work of the 20th-century sculptor, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107. The gallery displays some of his most significant work, and the building itself is an art monument. The permanent collection includes works of sculpture, drawings, design, furniture and architecture. The gallery building and grounds were based on original plans by Me\u0161trovi\u0107 himself, and included living and working areas, as well as exhibition spaces. Not far from the Gallery lies Ka\u0161telet-Crikvine, a restored chapel that houses a set of wooden wall panels carved by Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nOne of the most recognisable aspects of Split culture is popular music. Notable composers include Josip Hatze, Ivo Tijardovi\u0107, Zdenko Runji\u0107 \u2013 some of the most influential musicians in former Yugoslavia. Also, the more notable musicians and bands from Split are Oliver Dragojevi\u0107, Gibonni, Daleka Obala, Magazin, Severina, Dino Dvornik, Jasmin Stavros, Neno Belan, Goran Karan, Dra\u017een Ze\u010di\u0107, Doris Dragovi\u0107, Jelena Rozga, Tutti Frutti, Sini\u0161a Vuco, Meri Cetini\u0107 and guitar player Petar \u010culi\u0107. There is great cultural activity during summers, when the prestigious Split Music Festival is held, followed by the Split Summer (Splitsko ljeto) theater festival. Since 2013, the Ultra Europe electronic music festival is held at the Poljud stadium in July.\nSplit also developed a prominent hip hop scene, with notable acts such as The Beat Fleet, Dje\u010daci, Ki\u0161a Metaka and ST!llness.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nSportsmen are traditionally held in high regard in Split, and the city is famous for producing many champions. The most popular sports in Split are football (soccer), tennis, basketball, swimming, rowing, sailing, waterpolo, athletics, and handball. Residents of Split prefer to call their city as \"The sportiest city in the world\".\nThe main football (soccer) club is HNK Hajduk, one of the most popular clubs in Croatia supported by a large fan association known as Torcida Split, while RNK Split is the city's second club. Torcida Split is the oldest fan group in Europe est. 1950. The largest football stadium is the Poljud Stadium (HNK Hajduk's ground), with around 35,000 capacity (55,000 prior to the renovation to an all-seater). Slaven Bili\u0107, Aljo\u0161a Asanovi\u0107, Igor Tudor,  and Stipe Pletikosa are some of the famous Split natives who started their careers at Hajduk. Basketball is also popular, and the city basketball club, KK Split (Jugoplastika Split), holds the record of winning the Euroleague three consecutive times (1989\u20131991), with notable players like Toni Kuko\u010d and Dino Ra\u0111a both of whom are Split natives.\nWWE wrestler Josip Peruzovi\u0107, better known as Nikolai Volkoff, was born in Split.\nSplit's most famous tennis players are the retired 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107, Mario An\u010di\u0107 (\"Super Mario\"), Nikola Pili\u0107 and \u017deljko Franulovi\u0107. Marina Erakovic was also born in Split.\nMembers of the local rowing club HVK Gusar won numerous Olympic and World Championship medals.\nSwimming also has a long tradition in Split, with \u0110ur\u0111ica Bjedov (1968 Olympic Gold Medal and Olympic record in the 100 m breaststroke), Duje Draganja and Vanja Rogulj as the most famous swimmers from the city. As a member of the ASK Split athletics club, the champion Blanka Vla\u0161i\u0107 also originates from the city. The biggest sports events to be held in Split were the 1979 Mediterranean Games, and the 1990 European Athletics Championships.\nSplit was one of the host cities of the 2009 World Men's Handball Championship. The city constructed a new sporting arena for the event, the Spaladium Arena. Its capacity is around 12,000 spectators (in basketball events). The cost of the arena was evenly divided between the city and the government. Ivano Bali\u0107, two time IHF World Player of the Year is the most famous handball player to come from Split.\nSplit used to be the home to three highest-level waterpolo clubs, the winners of many domestic and international titles: Jadran (twice LEN Champions League winner), Mornar (LEN Cup Winners' Cup winner) and now defunct PO\u0160K (one LEN Champions League, one LEN Supercup and two times LEN Cup Winners' Cup winner). Many players from Split have participated at Olympic Games, World and European Championships, both for Croatia and Yugoslavia, having won a lot of medals. Several waterpolo players from Split during their careers have been considered the best in the World: Ratko Rudi\u0107, Damir Poli\u0107, Milivoj Bebi\u0107, Deni Lu\u0161i\u0107.\nPicigin is a traditional local sport (originating in 1908), played on the famous sandy beach Ba\u010dvice. It is played in very shallow water (just ankle deep) with a small ball. Picigin is played by five players. The ball is the peeled tennis ball. There is a tradition of playing picigin in Split on New Year's Day, regardless of the weather conditions, in spite of the sea temperature rarely exceeding 10 \u00b0C (50\u00b0F).\nRK Nada were the pioneers of rugby union in this part of the World. They were by far the strongest club in the former Yugoslavia and they are also by far the most successful club in modern-day Croatia.\nBaseball in Split is one of the city's longest traditions. Although the sport began semi-officially in December 1918 when a group of US sailors from a ship in port introduced the game to some young Croats, it wasn't until 1972 when a pair of teachers at a local school formed the Salona Baseball Club, named after the ancient Roman city of Salona.\nThe first actual game played in Split was on 9 September 1978 between Split (the new team moved here and was called Nada) and Jezice from Ljubljana\u2013a 20-1 romp for the locals!\nA schedule of games began in earnest and by 1980 there were regular league games. The next major milestone was in 1983 when the World Baseball Federation (IBAF) accepted Yugoslavia as an official member. A Croatian National Baseball Federation was established in 1989.\nToday the Croatian national team (with 10 or more members coming from Split's Nada team) is ranked 25th in the world.\nSplit's team, Nada, plays its homegames at old Hajduk stadium, where the rugby club also plays. Alas, without a mound, it is not a regulation field. The team's main rival is Zagreb and there are teams from half a dozen other cities around the country. In addition to playing other Croatian teams, inter-league games are played and the team travels to Belgrade and other cities to play.\nAlthough not a professional team or league, some player/coaches are paid. Several have pro experience and the new coach of the national team was a former major league pitcher with the LA Dodgers!  The source material here is from Mladen Cukrov's book \"There's no ball like baseball\" (Nima baluna do Baseball) and from the writer's experience as an assistant coach of the team for several years.\nThe Split SeaWolves is the only American football team in Dalmatia. Active from 2008, they are currently still developing and the main focus is on a flag football team.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nSplit is an important transport center for Dalmatia and the wider region. In addition to the Zagreb-Split freeway (A1), all the road traffic along the Adriatic coast on the route Rijeka\u2013Dubrovnik (Adriatic Highway) flows through the city. The city also has a series of expressways and avenues, enabling efficient, fast transit by car around the city and its suburbs. The most important mean of transport in Split is bus, the city being unsuitable for trams due to its hilly geography. The local public transport company Promet Split renovated its fleet in 2008 with the latest MAN and Mercedes-Benz models.\nSplit is also the southernmost integrated point of the Croatian Railway network. Within Split's city centre, railway traffic passes two tunnels before reaching the Central Station. The line to Split is unremarkable; a journey from Split to Zagreb or Rijeka takes around 5 hours, as the line is unelectrified and consists of only one track. Currently, there are no definite plans to upgrade the line, but with the start of work on the new Zagreb-Rijeka railway line in October 2007. The Split Suburban Railway network opened in early December 2006. It currently has one line, running from the Split city harbour to Ka\u0161tel Stari. The line is expected to get a second track and be fully electrified in the near future. New, low-floor trains are expected to be implemented as well. This line will also be lengthened, to encompass the aforementioned Split International Airport, and continue on to the towns of Trogir and Seget Donji. Split also plans to construct a mini-metro that in future.\nThe Split Airport in Ka\u0161tela is the second largest in Croatia in terms of passenger numbers (2,818,176 in 2017), with year-round services to Zagreb, Rome, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and the Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany, as well as heavy tourist traffic in the summer. The expansion of the terminal is scheduled to commence in 2012.  The airport is located about 20 km west of Split.\nThe Port of Split, with its annual traffic of 4 million passengers, is the third busiest port in the Mediterranean, with daily coastal routes to Rijeka, Dubrovnik, and Ancona in Italy. During the summer season Split is connected with other Italian cities as well, such as Pescara. Most of the central Dalmatian islands are only reachable via the Split harbor (with Jadrolinija and Split Tours ferries). This includes the islands of Bra\u010d, Hvar and \u0160olta, as well as the more distant Vis, Kor\u010dula and Lastovo. Split is also becoming a major cruise ship destination, with over 260 ship visits, carrying 130,000 passengers. The largest ship scheduled to dock is the 315 m long Celebrity Eclipse.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns\u2014Sister cities ===\nSplit is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nSplit is partnered with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDalmatia\nDiocletian's Palace\nList of ancient cities in Illyria\nSplit-Dalmatia County\nChurch of Holy Trinity, Split\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRobert Adam (1764).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "KidzMondo is an indoor theme park designed for children aged 2 to 14 years and their parents founded by a visionary business man, Ali Kazma. KidzMondo is a miniature replica of a real city where children get to role-play as adults in various occupations and professions.\n\n\n== The Concept ==\nKidzMondo is an indoor theme park following the conceptual approach of educational entertainment or playful learning. It is an ideal forum where social rules and values are promoted and ingrained in children to prepare them to behave as good adult citizens would in real life.\nKidzMondo aims to complement local school curricula and seeks to teach children basic citizenship values and rules, enlightening them about the society they live in today.\nIt is an established fact that children learn best through play and experiencing real hands on activities. The range of playful activities inside KidzMondo is exclusively created and constructed to help, encourage and advance physical growth while stimulating intellectual growth. The KidzMondo Educational Curriculum improves the development of skills and attitudes all the while motivating creative thinking and enhancing self-esteem and self-confidence levels.\nChildren can choose between 120+ different professions which are practiced in replica of the most representative establishments in an actual city; an airport, a bank, factories, a theater, shops, a police station, a fire department, a digital media office, a hotel, a TV studio, a radio station, a gas station, a race track and many more...\nKidzMondo provides children with a relevant and tangible learning experience, appealing to the need to address and encourage interest. Children will be exposed to age-appropriate activities in a dynamic and safe surrounding. They will be attracted to go through the different establishments, while providing them with a mental and physical voyage of investigation, exploration, and adults' role play.\n\n\n== Constitution for Children ==\nKidzMondo's constitution and its ideas of equality, respect for all, and the rights for self-expression and creativity are essential. As the children explore the world of KidzMondo, they will be learning valuable lessons in what it means to be a citizen \"kidizen\", as well as civic and social responsibility, essential self-reliance, and fiscal maturity. These lessons will stay with them well into their adult life, and serve to prepare the future generation for the tremendous challenges that lie ahead.\nSince the Theme Park operates as though it were a city, the visiting children are expected to act according to the following Constitution:\n1.\tAll Kidizens are Equal and United in play. \n2.\tKidizens have the right to be Happy and Free. \n3.\tKidizens have the right to Explore, Discover and be Curious about the World. \n4.\tKidizens have the right to Express themselves and be Creative. \n5.\tKidizens have the right to be treated with Respect. \n6.\tKidizens are always Polite, Honest and Kind. \n7.\tKidizens have the duty to Respect others including their elders. \n8.\tKidizens have a duty to help others when they can. \n9.\tKidizens have a duty to Protect nature and the environment. \n10.\tKidizens have their rights and duties guarded by the constitution of KidzMondo.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nFour characters help make the concept of KidzMondo more relatable and entertaining to children. They also represent the pillars of the KidzMondo constitution through their actions and values.\nBorn on Science Day (October 5) Kozmo is a loveable 10-year-old boy with big brown eyes and chestnut brown messy hair. He loves sports, technology and going on all kinds of adventures, especially the ones where the entire family can join in. He is caring, friendly, and very extroverted. He has a curious mind and is fascinated by everything and everyone. He is very spontaneous like most 10-year-old boys.\nBorn on Flowers Day (May 3) \u00cbena is a 6-year-old average sized \"little miss perfect\". She knows how to get her way. She  is  a  very  curious  girl,  always  asking  questions  for  deductive  reasoning (always answers them herself). She considers herself responsible for everyone and as a result she is the glue that holds the entire family together. It is her passion to guide and advise them on the right course of action.\nA Roman Sheepdog born on Friendship Day (July 20), Dogzilla is the original guardian of KidzMondo. He was too late to leave the city when the Roman children abandoned it in ancient times and was locked in. Dogzilla was able to live for over 2000 years through the magic of KidzMondo, guarding the city against any invaders. When the founders arrived, he was extremely happy to see someone. He decided to dedicate his life to serving the founders, protecting the city and all its inhabitants.\nA large and wise middle-aged tortoise born on World Turtles Day (May 23), Leeloo is \u00cbena's personal assistant. She is very organized and has everything arranged in order. The only problem is that she is always sleeping or daydreaming. When she does wake up she is very slow and only cares about one thing, how to assist Kozmo and \u00cbena to the best of her ability.\n\n\n== City Map ==\nThe architectural layout of the KidzMondo city is much like any real city in the world with a central plaza, clock tower, fire station, police station, hospital and many other functional establishments spread throughout the two-story buildings. However, the size of the buildings is all scaled down to cater to children and provide a more realistic experience for them.\n\n\n== Safety and Security ==\nKidzMondo has been working with safety consultants from around the world and has employed the latest technologies to ensure the safety and security of the children. They have managed to meet international standards for amusement parks by equipping the city with the latest technologies. Upon arrival, each child will be given a security bracelet called a \"KidzBand.\" It is an RFID security bracelet consisting of wireless technology that uses radio frequencies to identify and track kids inside the city at any time.\nIn addition to the hundreds of CCTV cameras installed to track kids around the city, KidzMondo assigns security personnel to be present 24 hours a day.\nMoreover, KidzMondo staff has all received training sessions in first aid and rescue, and in case of emergency a nurse is always present at the premises for assistance.\n\n\n== Other Services ==\nKidzMondo also provides a birthday party venue with customizable themes, school trip organization, and a summer camp.\nBirthdays: KidzMondo plan and facilitate birthday parties for young birthday girls and boys. Parents can choose from a collection of party themes.\nSchool trips: The activities provided at KidzMondo complement various school curricula at different age levels. Schools all over the country plan trips to KidzMondo to provide their students with an experience that is both entertaining and educational.\nSummer camp: During the summer, KidzMondo organizes a series of week-long summer camps, each revolving around a specific theme (or educational major), including theater, medicine, sports, etc. All the activities carried out throughout the summer camp will be directly related to that major.\n\n\n== Marketing Partners ==\nEnhancing the atmosphere of realism of the city of KidzMondo depends heavily on partnerships with esteemed AAA (triple A) companies and brands which are anchors on the development and growth of the city.\nFor every child-sized establishment, one, and only one, leading brand is chosen exclusively to represent its industry. No two partners are ever chosen to represent the same category or industry. KidzMondo provides a one-of-a-kind marketing channel that is more encompassing than traditional media for its marketing value. Brand messages are incorporated into daily life to allow children to experience various products and services provided by the different esteemed brands. KidzMondo also promotes interactive qualitative marketing, where children experience the marketing partners' products with their five senses: the children see, smell, touch, taste, and play with the brand. Since the children of today are the customers of tomorrow, they develop an unmatchable and long-lasting loyalty from a very early age and nurture it until they grow up. This demonstrates how partnering with KidzMondo brings about a long-term impact. In addition to that, children not only impact industries manufacturing toys, candy, or cars but they also influence purchasing decisions made my parents.\n\n\n== Franchise Expansion ==\nAfter its opening in Beirut Lebanon in 2013, KidzMondo city opened in Turkey, Istanbul in Trump Mall and in Qatar, Doha in Mall of Qatar and signed a franchise agreement with Box Hill institute to open other cities in Australia. Ali Kazma, the founder of this revolutionary concept, seeks to open more KidzMondo cities around the globe. More news about this edutainment concept are published on the official website on www.kidzmondo.com.\n\n\n== International Affiliations ==\nKidzMondo is also a registered member of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Organization .\n\n\n== References ==\nhttp://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Lifestyle/2013/Mar-18/210496-childrens-entertainment-park-set-to-open-early-may.ashx#axzz2NrEbA25f\nhttp://www.marcopolis.net/kidzmondo-makes-learning-exciting-through-their-edutainment.htm\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

M. Thomson proposed to a meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions that a college of higher learning, that would include medical training, should be established in Beirut with Dr. Daniel Bliss as its president. On April 24, 1863, while Bliss was raising money for the new college in the United States and England, the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College. The college, which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920, opened with a class of 16 students on December 3, 1866. Bliss served as its first president, from 1866 until 1902. In the beginning Arabic was used as the language of instruction because it was the common language of the ethnic groups of the region, and prospective students needed to be fluent in Ottoman Turkish or in French as well as in English. In 1887 the language of instruction became English.\n\nAUB alumni have had a broad and significant impact on the region and the world for many years. For example, 19 AUB alumni were delegates to the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945\u2014more than any other university in the world. AUB graduates continue to serve in leadership positions as presidents of their countries, prime ministers, members of parliament, ambassadors, governors of central banks, presidents and deans of colleges and universities, academics, businesspeople, scientists, engineers, doctors, teachers, and nurses. They work in governments, the private sector, and in nongovernmental organizations.\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War (1975\u20131990) AUB pursued various means to preserve the continuity of studies, including enrollment agreements with universities in the United States.  On January 18, 1984, AUB President Malcolm H. Kerr was murdered outside his office by members of Islamic Jihad, which preceded the Hezbollah. In 1982 Acting President David S. Dodge was kidnapped on campus by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim extremists. In 1984 and 1985 a number of university staff were kidnapped, including electrical engineering professor Frank Regier, professor J. Leigh Douglas, professor Philip Padfield, professor Joseph Cicippio, dean of the faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences Thomas Sutherland (held captive from 1985 to 1991), director David Jacobsen, and librarian Peter Kilburn (killed by his captors). In all, 30 university-connected people were kidnapped during the war.In November 1991, a bomb believed to have been set off by pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalists demolished the main building of the American University of Beirut, injuring four people, on the 125th anniversary of the school's founding.On March 21, 2008, the Board of Trustees selected Peter Dorman to be AUB's 15th president. He succeeded John Waterbury who was president of AUB from 1998 to 2008. Dorman is a scholar in the field of Egyptology and formerly chaired the University of Chicago's Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.\nOn March 19, 2015, the Board of Trustees formally approved the nomination of Fadlo R. Khuri, MD, as the next president. He was inaugurated as AUB's 16th president on January 25, 2016.After initially announcing that it would stay open in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ignoring the Lebanese Ministry of Education and Higher Education's request that it shut down, in early March 2020 the university announced that it would close down.\n\n\n== University presidents ==\nThe list of University presidents since its establishment:\nDaniel Bliss (1866\u20131902)\nHoward S.

AUB's campus in Ras Beirut consists of 64 buildings, seven dormitories and several libraries. In addition, the university also houses the Charles W. Hostler Student Center, an Archaeological Museum as well as the widely renowned Natural History Museum. Students also have a range of recreational and research facilities, such as the 247 acre research farm and educational complex hosted by the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences' AREC (Advancing Research Enabling Communities Center) in Beqaa, Lebanon.\n\n\n== Faculties ==\nFAFS, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences\nFAS, Faculty of Arts and Sciences\nFHS, Faculty of Health Sciences\nFM, Faculty of Medicine\nHSON, Rafic Hariri School of Nursing\nMSFEA, Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture\nOSB, Suliman S. Olayan School of Business\n\n\n== Students ==\nIn fall 2018, there were over 9,000 students enrolled at AUB: 7,180 undergraduates and 1,922 graduate students.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAUB offers 141 undergraduate/graduate programs and 36 certificates and diplomas.\nIn 2007, the American University of Beirut reintroduced PhD programs. Currently, it offers doctoral programs in the following fields:\nArab and Middle Eastern History\nArabic Language and Literature\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomedical Sciences\nCell and Molecular Biology\nCivil Engineering\nElectrical and Computer Engineering\nEnvironmental and Water Resources Engineering\nEpidemiology\nMechanical Engineering\nNursing\nTheoretical Physics\nAUB also includes dozens of research centers and institute that sponsor and promote research in a variety of fields.\n\n\n== Medical Center ==\nThe AUB Medical Center (AUBMC) is the private, not-for-profit teaching center of the Faculty of Medicine. AUBMC, which is accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCIA) on hospital accreditation, includes a 420-bed hospital and offers comprehensive tertiary/quaternary medical care and referral services in a wide range of specialties and medical, nursing, and paramedical training programs at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels.\nThroughout its history, the AUB Medical Center, which was formerly known as the American University Hospital (AUH), has played a critical role in caring for the victims of regional and local conflicts. It provided care for the sick and wounded during World War I and World War II, the Lebanese Civil War, the Palestinian conflict, and the invasion of Iraq. In recent years, it has provided care for a number of Syrian refugees at the Medical Center in Beirut, at partner hospitals, and at mobile clinics.Since 1905, AUB's medical services have included a nursing school. In 2008, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) invited AUB's Rafic Hariri School of Nursing to become a full member, making it the first member of the AACN outside the United States. The American Nurses Credentialing Center's (ANCC) Magnet Recognition Program awarded AUBMC its prestigious Magnet designation on June 23, 2009. AUBMC is the first healthcare institution in the Middle East and the third in the world outside the United States to receive this award.On April 4, 2011, AUB announced the AUBMC 2020 Vision, which includes the construction of a state-of-the-art medical complex consisting of 12 buildings that would increase bed capacity to almost 600. In his inaugural address in January 2016, AUB President Fadlo R. Khuri, MD, outlined Health 2025 affirming the University's commitment to be the regional leader and a key global partner in addressing global health challenges.\nAUBMC now includes the Rafic Hariri School of Nursing Building, the Pierre Abu Khater Outpatient Building, the Wassef and Souad Sawwaf Building, the Medical Administration Building, the Halim and Aida Daniel Academic and Clinical Center, and the Inpatient and Outpatient hospital buildings.\nThe University is also home to several Clinical and Research Centers of Excellence such as the Mamdouha El-Sayed Bobst Breast Unit, the Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute, the Abu-Haidar Neuroscience Institute, the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon (affiliated with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee), the Moufid Farra Heart and Vascular Outpatient Center, the Nehme and Therese Tohme Multiple Sclerosis Center, and the Ahmad and Jamila Bizri Neuro Outpatient Center. They address health issues endemic to the Arab region such as cancer, heart and vascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, blood disorders, and mental illness.\nAs part of the AUBMC 2020 vision, AUBMC held a groundbreaking ceremony for its New Medical Center Expansion Under the Patronage of HE President Michel Aoun in May 2019.\n\n\n== University museums and collections ==\nThere are three museums at AUB: the Archaeological Museum, the Geology Museum, and the Natural History Museum.\nThe Archaeological Museum is the third oldest museum in the Near East. Its collection includes more than 16,000 objects and 10,000 coins and features pottery, prehistoric flint tools, bronze figurines, Phoenician and classical sculptures and bas-reliefs, Egyptian alabaster vases from Byblos, hairpins, and musical instruments. The museum has conducted excavations in Lebanon and Syria. The Society of the Friends of the AUB Museum organizes lectures, exhibits, and activities for children.The Geology Museum includes rocks, minerals, and fossils from around the world. It is an important resource for AUB students and researchers and for students from other universities and schools in Lebanon.\nThe Natural History Museum houses a unique collection that represents the biodiversity of the area. It is especially well known for the Post Herbarium, which includes 63,000 specimens.AUB's Archives and Special Collections includes important documents related to the founding of the Syrian Protestant College in 1866 and also many materials (documents, maps, photographs, etc.) of interest to scholars of Lebanon and the region including the Beirut Codex, a New Testament in Syriac, dating back to the 9th or 10th century; the E. W. Blatchford Collection (photographs of the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa taken between 1880 and 1900); and political and cultural posters dating back to the 1940s.The American University of Beirut has embarked upon a new initiative (AUB Art Galleries and Collections) to play an active role in promoting fine and contemporary art in the region.\nThe very first step taken in this new direction coincided with the generous donation of Dr. Samir Saleeby to AUB. The Rose and Shaheen Saleeby Collection includes paintings by artists of different generations, ranging from Khalil Saleeby (1870-1928) and Cesar Gemayal (1898-1958) to Omar Onsi (1901-1969) and Saliba Douaihy (1912-1994). It also features works by Haidar Hamaoui (b. 1937), Chucrallah Fattouh (b. 1956), and Robert Khoury (b. 1923). The Saleeby donation is the cornerstone upon which AUB will establish a comprehensive collection of modern and contemporary art from the region.\nThe new initiative commenced with the launching of new art spaces located in and around AUB campus: the Rose and Shaheen Saleeby Museum in Sidani Street and the Byblos Bank Art Gallery, in Ada Dodge Hall (on campus).\n\n\n== Libraries ==\n\n\n=== University Libraries ===\nThe university libraries include:\n\nNami Jafet Memorial Library\nEngineering and Architecture Library\nSaab Medical Library serves the AUB Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, the Rafic Hariri School of Nursing, in addition to the entire AUB campus.\nScience and Agriculture Library.The Agricultural Research and Education Center (AREC) in the Beqaa Valley also includes an annex to the Science and Agriculture Library.\nThe University Libraries are home to a rich collection that consists of:\n\nPrint titles: 412,775 (books); 5,776 (periodicals)\nPrint volumes: 505,548 (books); 162,727 (periodicals)\nElectronic titles (including open access): 1,098,491 (books); 138,430 (periodicals)\nDatabases (paid subscriptions): 262\nPrint books purchased/added: 7,243 titles / 8,380 volumes\nGift/Exchange books added: 4,136 titles / 5,048 volumes\nManuscripts: 1,373 titles / 1,408 volumes\nMaps: 1,684 titles / 2,027 volumes\nUniversity archives: 940 linear feet / 2,720 archival boxes\nMicroform items: 11,487 titles / 33,265 volumes\nFilm and video titles: 3,544 titles / 4,629 volumes\nAudio recordings: 456 titles / 740 volumesAlthough many library resources are accessible remotely from on and off campus, the libraries themselves are equipped with e-classrooms, computer labs, and wireless connectivity. Trained and experienced library staff conduct classes and workshops throughout the year to introduce and train users to take advantage of the libraries' collections, information resources, and innovative technologies.\n\n\n== AUB Press ==\nThe American University of Beirut (AUB) has been publishing since its inception as the Syrian Protestant College (SPC). The earliest publication held in AUB's Nami Jafet Memorial Library was published in 1881; a study in Arabic on the management of disease, written by Dr. John Wortabet, professor of Anatomy and Physiology in the medical school of the Syrian Protestant College.At the time, the SPC had no university press nor a centralized publication office. The earliest publications of the college were published in the name of the college by the American Mission Press, which was founded in Malta in 1822, moved to Beirut in 1832, and operated until 1965. Other publishers produced books for AUB, including the Franciscan Press in Jerusalem and the Catholic Press in Beirut.\nIn 1969, a formal centralized publications office was created, the Office of Publications. By 2001, a decision was made to publish books in the name of the AUB Press rather than the more general American University of Beirut name. In 2004, organizational changes at AUB resulted in the split of the Office of University Publications into two separate offices. The Office of University Publications, which became the Office of Communications, came under the jurisdiction of the Office of Development and External Relations while the AUB Press, focused on publishing academic research as books, was placed under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Provost.\n\n\n== Fundraising ==\n\nOn January 16, 2017, AUB President Fadlo R. Khuri announced BOLDLY AUB: The Campaign to Lead, Innovate, and Serve during an event on campus in Beirut, Lebanon. The New York launch was on March 16, 2017. The goals of the five-year $650 million Campaign are to enrich the educational and research experience of students and faculty; serve the healthcare needs of the region; prioritize innovation and entrepreneurship; engage with communities in the region to achieve real impact; and secure the University's long-term sustainability.\nIn January 2017, AUB also announced the largest gift in its history from the Semaan Foundation to name the Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. AUB has received major gifts in support of the BOLDLY AUB Campaign as well from the Dar Group (to design a Medical Center and develop a Campus Master Plan) and from Jamal Daniel and the Levant Foundation for an expansion of the Medical Center.\n\n\n== Accreditation ==\nAUB was granted institutional accreditation in June 2004 by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The University's accreditation was reaffirmed in 2009 and again in 2016 and 2019.In September 2006, the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) accredited the Graduate Public Health Program in the Faculty of Health Sciences (FHS). The program was reaccredited in 2012 for seven years. The AUB Graduate Public Health Program is the first CEPH-accredited public health program outside the North American continent and the only CEPH-accredited public health program in the Arab world, Asia, and Africa.The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accredited AUB's Rafic Hariri School of Nursing's BSN and MSN programs on October 13, 2007. The accreditation was reaffirmed in 2012.In April 2009, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited the Suliman S. Olayan School of Business (OSB). The accreditation was reaffirmed in 2014. AACSB is the leading international accrediting agency for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degree programs in business administration and accounting. Less than five percent of business schools worldwide have earned AACSB International accreditation.The Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at the American University of Beirut received accreditation for its undergraduate BE civil engineering, BE computer and communications engineering, BE in electrical and computer engineering, and BE in mechanical engineering programs from the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) in 2008. The accreditation was reaffirmed in 2016. The undergraduate program in chemical engineering was accredited in 2013.\nThe Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences' undergraduate Nutrition and Dietetics Coordinated Program (NDCP) was accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) in 2013. It was reaccredited in 2017.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nAUB has 64,417 living alumni.

Classes started in 1866. Although founded by the American Protestant Mission to Lebanon, the school was set up as an autonomous organization and has no official relationship with any religious body. Its present name was adopted in 1920. The educational philosophy is similar to that of an American university, but its program is adapted to the educational needs of the Middle East; some 80 percent of its students come from the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa. A school of medicine was opened in 1867, a school of pharmacy in 1871, and a school of nursing and a hospital in 1905. In the 1950s the university expanded to include a school of engineering, a school of agricultural science, and a school of public health. A business school was established in 2000. All are important to the country, and the hospital was the main medical centre of Beirut in the early years of the Lebanese Civil War (1975\u201390). The university managed to remain in operation during the war, but most of the non-Arab members of its faculty had fled Lebanon by the late 1980s.American University of BeirutNew College Hall, American University of Beirut; the original College Hall suffered extensive damage in a 1991 bombing and was subsequently reconstructed.Soman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nWorld Organizations: Fact or Fiction?\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is limited to European countries.\n\n\n\n ",

Its construction, with a Neoclassical facade, interior and plan inspired by the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, began in 1884 and ended in 1894.\nThe cathedral was heavily hit and shelled during the Lebanese civil war and was plundered and defaced. A number of works of art that were looted have since been recovered, including the famous painting by Delacroix representing Saint George, the patron saint of the cathedral and of the Archdiocese of the city of Beirut. The cathedral was restored after the end of the hostilities and was re-inaugurated by the Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir on 24 April 2000.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe Cathedral of Saint George was built by Monsignor Joseph Debs, the Archbishop of Beirut, on the site of an earlier church that was also dedicated to the same saint. The earlier structure was built in 1755 to serve the Maronites of Beirut. Work began in 1884 using Roman columns from the temple of Deir El Qalaa in Beit Mery. The edifice was completed and consecrated on Palm Sunday in 1894. Built on the plan of a basilica with its nave and two lateral aisles separated by two rows of columns, the cathedral has a fa\u00e7ade of neo-classical style designed by Italian architect Giuseppe Maggiore. The interior bears a general resemblance to that of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.The nave is covered with a coffered ceiling with gilded and a double wooden structure, covered with golden leaves on a beige background. The walls are decorated with stucco and marble. Above the main altar is a canopy four columns. At the rear, in the choir, is the cathedra (bishop throne) of the Archbishop of Beirut, and the chair used by Pope John Paul II during his pastoral visit to Lebanon in 1997.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nInspired by the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, Saint George Maronite Cathedral was built between 1884 and 1894, and inaugurated by Bishop Youssef Debs. Prior to this, the Maronite community of Beirut had made use of a small church that stood nearby and dated back to 1753. In 1954, engineer Antoun Tabet undertook restoration works inside the cathedral. Originally planned in the shape of a cross, its transept was shortened and arches added at either end. Badly damaged during the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), the cathedral was completely rehabilitated by 1997, recovering its original Renaissance cruciform shape. It was inaugurated in April 2000.  Beneath the forecourt of the cathedral\u2019s annex, significant archaeological remains have been unearthed and preserved. They include a Hellenistic structure, part of the Roman Decumanus Maximus colonnaded street, and an Ottoman wall.\nOn 19 November 2016, Beirut Archbishop Paul Matar inaugurated the new campanile which took a decade to construct. The campanile stands 72 meters (236 ft) high; the original design envisaged a 75 meters (246 ft) tall bell tower to match the height of the campanile of the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome. According to the archbishop, the reduction in the campanile's height to stand equal to that of the minarets of the adjacent Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque aims to send a message of interfaith solidarity and harmony.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Church of Saint George is located in the downtown area of Beirut. It is one of the most important religious buildings of the city. Right next to her is the Sunni Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque. About eighty meters north is the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1884-1894: Construction of the Cathedral, which was inspired by the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.\n1954: Restoration works inside the cathedral undertaken by Antoun Tabet.\n1975-1990: Civil War badly damaged the cathedral.\n1997: Post war rehabilitation of the Cathedral led to the recovery of its original Renaissance cruciform shape.

        "wiki": "The Master Plan, completed and approved in 1994, set up the guidelines for the conservation and restoration of some 291 buildings identified as buildings to be preserved and restored.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nIn 1993, 291 buildings were identified as buildings to be preserved and restored. Mainly concentrated in the Etoile and Foch-Allenby districts, Saifi Village and Wadi Abu Jamil, the retained buildings were to be restored following the Master Plan guidelines. The Master Plan was completed and approved in 1994  by a decree emanating from the Council of Ministers. \nRetained buildings were divided into three categories: governmental and religious, buildings of heritage and architectural value (to be restored without external alteration) and \u2018other category\u2019 buildings (only limited alterations and additions were permitted). \nWhile buildings of heritage value had to be restored without external alteration, only limited alterations and additions were permitted for the \u2018other category\u2019 buildings.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1993, 291 buildings were identified as buildings to be preserved and restored out of nearly 900 buildings left standing after the war. Many of the surviving heritage buildings were in a hazardous and dilapidated state mainly due to small arms fire and subsequent deterioration. The main concentrations of retained buildings were in the Etoile and Foch-Allenby districts of Beirut\u2019s historic core, Saifi Village and Wadi Abu Jamil. The Master Plan, completed and approved by a decree emanating from the Council of Ministers in March 1994, outlined the restoration of the retained buildings. Buildings identified for preservation were divided into three categories: governmental and religious, buildings of heritage and architectural value and \u2018other category\u2019 buildings. These were mainly modern structures in salvageable state.  Buildings of heritage value had to be restored without external alteration, while limited alterations and additions were permitted for \u2018other category\u2019 buildings. Considerable local stonemasonry skills were required to complete the restoration of these buildings, especially with regard to the hand-carving of decorative features, copied from surviving fragments.  An important aspect of restoration in the historic core was the parallel implementation of a pedestrian zone using basalt setts, salvaged from beneath existing streets, together with a unique vocabulary of street furniture. This included the re-creation of the original lighting poles and brackets designed for Beirut in the 1920s. This type of high quality restoration in a pedestrian setting makes Beirut\u2019s Conservation Area a landmark historical district.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1993:  Identification of 291 buildings as buildings to be preserved and restored.\n1994: Completion and approval of the Master Plan by a decree emanating from the Council of Ministers, which outlined the restoration of the retained buildings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoch-Allenby district\nSaifi Village\nWadi Abu Jamil\nDecree of Council of Ministers 1994\nSolidere\nBeirut Conservation Area\nBeirut conservation\nBeirut restoration\nEtoile Square\nPlace de l'Etoile, Beirut\nLebanese Civil War\n\n\n== References ==\nGavin, Angus; Malouf, Ramez (1996).

          "The cafes and restaurants might be a bit more expensive but it is an absolute pleasure to enjoy your meal, drink and a shisha in this quiet area. easy access to the Beirut souk.",
          "The day we went the government had restricted access to much of downtown, and so there was almost no one there. Peaceful in a way, but a water and a lemonade were $10+",
          "The centre of the 'old' city, people come here just to hang out. Always a military presence though. In close proximity to the grand sites of Beirut, worth taking a walk through.",
          "Once you get past the rusted metal obstacles, crooked fences and barbed wire that surrounds downtown area, you are welcomed by soldiers and other weird armed looking men... only to find yourself surrounded by a bunch of empty abandoned stores and buildings, with scouring bearded",
          "For anyone interested in the history of Beirut, this place is a must. The clocktower is iconic, and is steps away from historic mosques, churches, and Roman ruins. The Lebanese parliament, various ministries, chic boutiques and cafes - what more do you need?",
          "so nice to go there on a weekend morning \u2026 so calm and peaceful \u2026 sitting in one of the cafes around the place de l'etoile you can enjoy breakfast or an espresso or a cup of tea enjoying the view of all the marvelous renovated beautiful buildings ,,, watching the flock of",
          "The Place de L'etoile is right next to the Parliament and packed with security men but do not disturb anyone. There is nothing special about the Place except the various over priced cafes and restaurants next to it> Overall recommended if you are in the area",
          "once a vivid square, circulation in the area was forbidden following the first signs of public revolt during the arab spring - the square, one of the few public open areas in beirut, was where young protesters used to gather. access to the square is guarded by armed milirary,",
          "Very nice area in the center of Beirut, particularly in the evening. Lot's of nice cafes, interesting shops, restaurants. Pleasant walk.",
          "Beautiful spot, nice to walk, nice to make photos. On a sunny day take your time, sit down, have a coffee and a shisha.",
          "It is always tempting in every city in the world to check the main square, the very downtown hoping to see the really old houses and trying to feel yourself travelled in time. Unfortunately Beirut has a difficult history: a civil war ruined plenty of central houses, which were",
          "There are a few people front of the clock tower. The cafes are empty. We didn't understand why people don't prefer to go. less than 300-400 meters Beirut Souks is very crowded. You can find shisha cafes at the square.",
          "This is the only palce in town which is pedestrian friendly. The tower is next to the Greek Orthodox church. Many pigeons around the square. Good place for people watching their daily routine while enjoying a coffew. Few Governamental buildings are located in this area as well.",
          "We loved this place every time we visited Beirut. But now it's empty and sad. It's a shame to see what they have done to this lovely place that attracted people at all agars.",
          "This place was a very crowded place but now it's not crowded at all. There's all around this place army for security. I don't recommend it very much",
          "How sad it is to see a lively and active place turn into a dull and boring one. Years ago and it is becoming worst and worst :( so bad for my lovely country. i hope one day the place will nourish again and be a place for all ages and all people, and cafes and restaurants become",
          "It's a lovely central square right in front of the parliament. Unfortunately, after the protests and the war, the restaurants and shops that surrounded it packed up and moved so it's now empty and rather forlorn. My friend said when she was young it was the place to be, and",
          "It was the center of Beiruth before the war, it was the most luxurius, international, live and vivrant place in medle east were the west founded the east. Now is restored, but empty, is just the outside beautifull buildings from the past. There is no life, there is alone, just",
          "You can find out what time it is. Otherwise this is a big clock tower. Near parliament and the St George Greek Orthodox church. Take the time to explore the shops. The buildings were all built with great care to restore them to their pre-war condition. Kind of like Disneyland.",
          "There are very cute shops and cafes in this area and it is nice it is pedestrian only. Fun fact - when you are at the airport, you can check out photos of what the area looked like during the war. The difference is unbelievable!",
          "it is best part of Beirut. very clean and with a lot of tourist. i like it very much. it's relaxing place.",
          "Beautiful historical place , very well renovated after the war by the ex-prime minister Rafik Hariri.",
          "It that its the down town and the heart of beirut but its a little bit heart breaking , great buildings but empty , but its good to see dont plan any thing there just visit and take some pics .",
          "I couldn't understand why this place is abandoned. Its in the heart of town. In past must be very crowded and full of joy. Now every entrence has a military checkpoint and shops are abandoned. Also you can see rearly other people. Its a real pity",
          "This used to be the most fun hyped area full of young people tourist from every where , but since the politicians in lebanon had their parliment over there , its like total empty these days , since its blocked or not totally opened like its used to be , would love to see it like",
          "we visited the square at the weekend and it was empty ,the place was very quite and enjoyed playing with the pigeons ,the square very beautiful and peacful ,you are surrounded with historical buildings everywhere",
          "It's a shame the square isn't running at its usual bustling self as it could very well compare to any square in Paris! It's architecturally stunning! But it's just lifeless these days although there are still some good restaurants just off the square. Maybe the life comes back",
          "This place used to gather ppl and tourists from 4 corners of the country and the world. Most famous for its proximity to the parlimant and the scattered shops and restaurants all over. Unfortunately given the situation the place is i total lockdown and all business hv fleed the",
          "Due to security reasons the Lebanese army forces closed and blocked any accessibility to this place. Here's a trick though ;) Say you're going to Egypt Air office to change your flight. They'll let you in.. you can sneak a picture or two but don't let them see you haha Enjoy",
          "Inspired by its French counterpart, Nejmeh Square is a pedestrian zone that combines French, Oriental and modern influences. The square is bordered by restaurants, caf\u00e9s, mosques and cathedrals, as well as the Lebanese Parliament building, and is a junction between several",
          "Every where close than Beirut downtown was destroyed in the Lebanon war (2006). The place is good to spend your time drink a coffee and appreciate all building, included the lebanese parliament.",
          "This area is closed off from vehicular traffic by military checkpoints which means only foot traffic. As parliament was in session we could not take photos of the parliament buildings but no restrictions for anywhere else. Some beautiful architecture is evident in the area and",
          "While the big crowds are gone, still an impressive place with a lot of history. Sit in a sidewalk cafe and wath people passing by.",
          "In first place we had to pass a military check point to access downtown. Secondly, the central square was completely deserted. No one around. Nice buildings, an orthodox church, some ruins but also a eerie feeling. It is a shame, locals told us that it used to be very crowded",
          "I always enjoy a good walk there with my children, since no cars are allowed there, they can play with the pigeons.",
          "Before this place was crowded with people and tourist but now not much people there I don't no why but I hope they will re-arrange the place again for tourist.",
          "Big disappointment. I thougt it was the center of Beirut... But now is full of barricades, to stop cars, vehicles, and it is empty of people. The Clock Tower it is not beauiful. What a pity!",
          "One of my favorite places in Beirut. But it was so calm and coul not see so much people. when you are close to the watch tower you can see a lot of historical places belong to the different cultures. A must visit place.",
          "Sadly this area has been abandoned in terms of restaurants and shops but you still have the beautiful St Georges Cathedral not to be misse!",
          "With the pedestrianised heart of the city blocked off at each access point by fences manned by armed soldiers, it's not the most inviting place - at first we weren't even sure if we were allowed in. That probably accounts for the lack of people you see, which has its own charms",
          "Somewhat surreal with the police barriers at the entry points to the area and the relatively deserted streets, but worth at least a stroll through. Place de L'Ecole Restaurant and Cafe is a convenient place to take a break, right in front of the clock tower. You may do more",
          "This place is one of the \"secrets\" of Beirut. Closed off due to the protests of last year, the authorities had it closed down. As a consequence, most of the shops had to close as the customers disappeared. Now it is possible to enter the area, and the abscence of cars makes it",
          "Everything is closed in the area. Only few ( two or three) shops and restaurants were opened. Soldiers were guarding and nothing else! Maybe some days had a glorious nights",
          "You must go here to see the downtown area and shopping. Beautiful Mosques, and churches side by side .",
          "This square is mostly blocked for Lebanese people and there is really not much to see. I remember there were some super expensive restaurants that used to over-charge tourists, I don't know if they're still there.",
          "this place summarizes everything terrible in this country: a fake place, built to impress tourists and nothing more. it always reminds me of these impressing yet uninhabited buildings that North Korea built on the borders with the South. most Lebanese can't access this place",
          "Visit it at night and take a camera ,the place is amazing.There are armed men at every entrance and they will open to check your bags.its worth going.its a romantic walk through the historical buildings.",
          "Apparently this clock was moved to safety during the civil war. It is wonderful that this iconic landmark survived and is a photograph magnet. The surrounding area is being re-developed/restored but the vibrant atmosphere which was central to the area in its heyday is long gone.",
          "Most of the restaurants have all moved to the Beirut Souks. There are armed men at every entrance and will question you when you try to enter. And once you do enter you will just see empty shops. A few restaurants are left and a starbucks, but that is about it.",
          "the location is nice but you can maximum spend 15 minutes touring it. their is nothing you can do except taking some photos",
          "A nice place to visit. Renovated recently after the civil war destroyed the whole city. Restaurants and shops in the area closed because of security measures taken by the police to protect the parliament from rioters and demonstrator.",
          "Do not waste time. Take a camera and visit it at night.the place is amazing.t is closed y military forces so no cars can get in but it is allowed to Wal all around.",
          "This area is adjacent a mix of new, post-civil war construction as well as historical, pre-civil war buildings and ruins. It's a fairly quiet area and pleasant to walk around.",
          "A mark in the history of Beirut has been very well kept and renovated, in the middle of the new down town, great to see and some cafes around it as well.",
          "Place de l\u00b4Etoile is in the safety zone so I think that ordinary tourist can get there only when staying in one of hotels there. I was lucky to have a friend with an access to the area so we could enjoy a calm moment with tens of pigeons and very few tourists. It used to be a",
          "A place used to be crowded and the restaurants and cafes were full , now is empty . We couldn't access to the square because of the army , they closed all the lane that take you to it. one restaurant is struggling to survive .",
          "Until pretty recently, this was a wonderfully active area. Now it is surrounded by razor wire and access in/out is controlled by the military. There's a Starbucks and the Cafe de l'Etoile inside (and a few shops and restaurants) but don't count on the military granting you",
          "February 2016: The words \"ghost city\" pretty much sum up what you feel if you enter the army-guarded area, which looks like an empty movie set... It's a beautiful renovated area but you need to be able to see it \"alive\" to appreciate what it has to offer. Such a shame things",
          "we went all around to find a place to enter without barbwire,but we had to go trough check point. place is like abandoned city. very nice orthodox old church with even older foundations. i have asked locals why is it so heavily guarded and i have been told that downtown beirut",
          "You can't get down to this attraction as it is blocked by the military as is most of the downtown sights - nothing for tourists to see. What a shame.",
          "Probably the most strategic place but currently blocked to the public. A small square surrounded by parliament and two of the most beautiful cathedrals in Beirut - the majestic Saint Georges Greek Orthodox and Saint Elie Greek Catholic.",
          "In the heart of Beirut city...in the downtown area...you can walk and have fun exploring shops, cafes...it's nice to walk there...you can see people around you...children playing...",
          "Every time I go there, I rarely see any locals. It is a shame that the full potential of this place has not been used. 90% Arabic restaurants, which are not even that good, no good shops. The way I would see that place is with more little traditional shops, and more",
          "Very cute, in an Italian-esque area. Definitely recommend, even if you're not staying in Beirut for a long time.",
          "40 years have passed since the civil war happened...but now we can explore the downtown without security concerns. Beirut was called 'Paris in the Middle East,' and this place reminds me of the prosperity of this beautiful city!!",
          "Unfortunately in our days this sqaure is surrounded by barriers! It worth to visit it and to admire the Rolex clock .... but you need a permission from the solders in the street barriers. Most of the time the soldiers allow tourists to pass.",
          "I have absolutely no idea why one would venture here or spend time here. I visited today and there were police at every entrance with gates and guns. All shops were closed, and yes it was a public holiday, but they appeared to be closed much longer than for the day. It was a",
          "very nice renovated place good for strolling and for having coffee . fancy shops and restaurants it is recommended for a short strolling and taking some photos .",
          "due to political reasons, this area is almost empty of visitors except people who works there during the days. it was a great place with many restaurants and places to spend time is",
          "A quality place for walking, eating, and shopping. Quality restaurants and Coffee shops. It is at the front door of the parliament. A must go place.",
          "It's too bad for something this wonderful to turn into a city of ghosts! When once this place was so full of people you can't even find a place to stand, is now an empty place! When you are standing in this square, you will be surrounded by the Lebanese parliament from one side,",
          "The place is so nice in the evening, you can walk, sit in a coffee shop, have diner and talk for a while",
          "Situated in the downtown of Beirut, you can enjoy a walk through the boutiques, have lunch in a restaurant, check the beirut big ben which is next to the Lebanese parliament, an old renovated building - that's if you enjoy architecture suff...",
          "Lovely square. Great history. Eerily quiet, with few people around. Felt safe though - lots of security around",
          "Great for getting some pictures around the down town clock and seeing the Lebanese parliament as well. This place will show you the traditional architecture of the buildings in Beirut that have been renovated. You may want to spend around an hour or so in this place and then",
          "Stumbled upon this by \"accident \" as I explored the French Influenced area of shops near all the new Malls / Souq\u2026 Its has a series of beautiful streets and walkways radiating front eh clock tower and the near by historical church and blue mosque add to the impact\u2026. it also",
          "We spent some hours on a Sunday afternoon - with families, kids running around and this so beautiful place sorrunding building very different still all making a whole. No traffic - so just quite. We kept on snapping pictures, but it was the ambience that was the thing!!",
          "I like this place, because it's quiet and perfect for a little walk and some coffee. I found it a little strange, that there are so less people around. The whole area is for pedestrians only and a save place for little kids, bringing their bikes, skaters or just to let them",
          "Downtown Beirut centred around Place de l'Etoile has been completely rebuild after 1990. They also did a beautiful job at doing so as this area will really give you a feel of what Beirut has looked like during its heydays. But the downtown area and Place de l'Etoile lacks in",
          "Due to the presence of Parliament all roads are closed for cars to reach the place de l'etoile. Nice walk, some nice restaurants all around.",

          "Nicely refurbished area, with no tourists at all which is pity because the area deserves to be visited.",
          "An interesting pedestrian part of Beirut in the downtown area. You can pass by as you visit other landmarks around.",
          "A chic extensive square with a French feel home to a number of pricey cafes, restaurants and shops. A place for outings and dining with nearby sopping stores and mosques and churches.",
          "Beirut is a busy town with a lot of traffic, therefore the Place de l\u00b4Etolle with its pedestrian streets is a welcomed break. Here you can sit on a caf\u00e9 overlooking the square without hearing the honking of car horns all that clear. If you have children you could even allow them",
          "Walking around downtown of Beirut will make you ask yourself \"Am I really in Lebanon?\". This place is like you are in Paris, buildings were beautifully constructed and their Parliament is located there too! The most interesting for me will be the huge Rolex clock, simply",
          "It is a nice place but sadly very empty. There is a nice small tour with a clock on it. It is situated in the very centre of downtown.",

          "If you visit the St George cathedral you will be in this square . Its a pleasant place , quiet and good for a stroll . Some people have noted its not as vibrant as it was and thats true , then again I like it in its tranquility.",
          "I suppose once the political situation is better people will return to the area. At present it is quite deserted with only two cafes open. Such a pity as could be quite lovely to sit and people watch.",
          "In the last few years, this square became less vital as before.. But it still has its own charm.. Shops & restaurants are available in the area.. I like it the most when pigeons walks on floor between people.. It's simply amazing",
          "A nice, clean square with some cafes to sit in and enjoy the place. Overall it's clean and cozy with the clock in the middle of the square.",
          "Beautifully designed but sadly heartless and soulless place. It is nice to get away from all the noise and the cars but unless you have young children who want to chase pigeons, there are only overpriced restaurants in this area.",
          "a nice place to visit, a charming walk in the renovated streets, mixed with the roman and various ruins. This place used to be extermly vibrant with its restaurants and shops, witch practically all closed due to the political and economic crisis. still a very nice pedestrian",
          "Its an utter disappointment, the restaurants closed, you have to go through checkpoints to get there, the rents are out of the world. The only bright side about this square is the st. Georges Greek Orthodox Cathedral which is worth a visit during pray time.",
          "Beautiful place for a stroll especially at night with a lot of good restaurants around it, you can also visit the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George which located within the square",
          "a beautiful place for a stroll - and yet so empty... looks like a ghost town, which may make you feel a bit creepy.",
          "Roman ruins, Lebanese Grand Serail, stairs, sitting place, garden and fountain. No cars, a lot of shops and restaurants.",
          "When we were there everything was closed, almost no people around, and whenever we asked them about something which was presumably close to that place (some recommended cafes or places of interest), in Arabic, nobody could tell us anything. Some buildings looked great, but in",
          "A very nice place to discover, sit and have a walk at night, but the waiters of the restaurants keep asking you to come in and sit like beggars. Overall, should be seen.",
          "The square is full of restaurants and caf\u00e9 where you can enjoy traditional Lebanese food as well as international. The cafes also offer a relaxing chillout place after work. Make sure to look upward and check the square's numerous old and historical buildings.",
          "Place de l'Etoile is a very chic square situated in the heart of downtown Beirut . from the first sight you will feel that you are in Paris. You will feel that this square is a piece from Paris. In the heart of the square you will see the horloge of liberty and on your right is",
          "We could stay at one of the cafes in Place de l'Etoile for hours and never get bored just watching the kids playing and people hanging out around the square, must do in Beirut!",
          "Reconstruction did a lot here. I would say maybe too much... The restoration of ancient buildings was done in a way that... now they look fake!!! The place has no character and you do not find (a lot) of lebanese hanging here around. Apart in the so called \"Beirut Souks\" that",

          "A very beautiful place, will remind you of Champs Elysees of Paris. I was fascinated by the environment and most of all the sound of the Prayer's Athan with the Church's Bells :)",
          "Go and have a stroll here, just to see the St georges cathedral (a must), teh Parliament buildings and the reconstructed downtown area. Sad to see the children madly driving their tricycles around the Etoile, because there's no other park anywhere for them to do so otherwise.",
          "I walked through the area on the way to Beirut Souk. I had my bag searched up entering but the ubiquitous security and armed forces that cover the city. The streets and nice enough and there is plenty of food options available to you. With the lack of through traffic the area",
          "A lot of Restaurant, seating available on both sides, outside and inside seating area. Very nice & safe area for families & groups. The staff speaks many languages and are very friendly. Food serve great Lebanese tradition food, like Fattouch, Tabouleh and Kebe & many more.",
          "Restaurant with seating available both outside and inside. The square is in a very safe area popular with families. The staff speak reasonable English and serve great Fattouch, Tabouleh and Kebe as starters. Main courses are more international in taste.",

          "Very friendly staff. Enjoyable and cool during summer months. You will enjoy drinking your coffee there.",
          "I have been to Beirut several times and in that time I've really seen a change in downtown. It is worth a visit once to see the beauty of the architecture and the detail of post-war reconstruction. But between the advent of the new souks and Zaltouney Bay restaurants and the",
          "This used to be a very busy place, with a great deal of traffic jams, merchants all around, shops of all kind. The area was severly damaged during the long Lebanese war (1975-1990), but it was rebuit under the supervision of late prime minister Refic Hariri back to its old",
          "Lovely area, cordoned off with barriers and police armed with machine guns, a little off putting, restaurants ok, the whole area lacks a buzz, no real attraction within to visit, seemed slightly empty on the occasions I visited which is a real shame because it is a beautiful",
          "This place as well as the rest of Downtown Beirut is fake. It has nothing to do with Lebanon or Lebanese culture. Restaurants are overpriced and there's no soul surrounding the area. It just looks empty. How can people compare Paris, the most beautiful city in the world, to",
          "It was quiet, and beautiful. Could have been the time of day, or time of year, but it was clear from visiting here that this is why people called Beirut \"The Paris of the Middle East\". The architecture was beautiful, and nicely restored. It's immediately after the Souks, so",
          "There are nice cafes there whre you can have nice mezes although the places look like it is fast food restaurants, soldiers everywhere",
          "When in Beirut you have to visit this place. all is new and taken care off. This is the more luxurious area for sure. High end fashion and upscale restaurants are around in this area and some good coffee bars. Definitely a must see area.",

          "Sitting at Place de l'Etoile inone of the many cafes, have a coffee and shisha. Just sit, relax, and watch people. It is an amazing venue with a lot of charme. For me it was the best part of Beirut.",
          "In middle of this is the clock tower, just a cross the street from the lower side of the Roman baths. Around the tower are restaurants. Good place to sit and people watch",
          "I liked the wide selection of things to do there. There is something for everyone to do and so much is nearby. Once can spend a full day there and not have enough.",
          "the streets leading to this little place are packed with restaurants, rather european style atmosphere, nice for a stroll and a coffee of fresh lemonade",
          "When you hear about \"Place de l'Etoile\", you immediately think to Paris' one, with its very big buildings and the obelisk. In Beirut, the place is on average of the country itself, small but beautiful. You shouldn't miss it for any reason.",
          "I visited in night-time and daytime and tried different restaurants. One, on a side street and offering regional cuisine, was very good if with the service appearing a bit tired. The other, offering French cuisine, was run-of-the-mill. This pedestrian area has a number of shops",

          "Nice area in heart of Central Beirut with clock tower, cathedral, mosque, restaurants. Very quiet when we were there.",
          "this is on the other side of the newer Souqs and much nicer. Just really a cafe row but at least it is located in the older and preserved area of town. So for a cafe, nargila, lunch or a glass of wine, skip the Souq's and head here",
          "great touristic aura, many cafes and restaurant to choose from, my favourite is Albalad restaurant for good Lebanese Mezza and an \"arguile\". A pedestrian area with nearby parkings and accessible by taxis which drop you off at the end of the pedestrian streets coming out of place",

        "wiki": "Bsous Silk Museum (Arabic: \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u0633\u0648\u0633\u200e) is a silk museum in the town of Bsous near Wadi Chahrour in Lebanon, located around 15 kilometres east of Beirut. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe structure was originally built by the Fayad family, and operated as a silk factory between 1901 and 1954. In 1990, for a short time, the factory and the grounds were occupied by the Syrian army. It was restored by its owners, George and Alexandra Asseily, with the help of Jean-Louis Mange, to serve as a museum. The museum opened in 2000 and highlights the 1,500-year-old history of silk production in Lebanon, which ended when the last silk mill closed in the 1970s.Thierry Huau and Francoise Le Noble Predine from Paris, played a major role in the redevelopment of the gardens to the building. Le Noble brought wild silk from Madagascar and together with Mona Sader Issa helped to establish aMED, the Association of Memory and Development. Students of the Lyc\u00e9e Agricole et Horticole of Saint Germain en Laye in France and the Association have been responsible for many ecological projects in the village of Bsous and the pine forests around Beirut. Architect Jacques Abou Khaled, under the management of Sami Feghali were responsible for the redesign of the building into a museum.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nPart of the Silk Museum's permanent collection includes live silkworms. Exhibits demonstrate the process of \"hatching\" the silkworm, leading to the production of silk thread and weaving through all the various stages. Also on display are domestically made finished silk products, such as traditional Lebanese evening dresses and silk trousers that were worn by princesses in the nineteenth century. There is also has a wing dedicated to eastern silk and gold, and a wing holding the treasures of the Bags Antaki family of Aleppo, dated to the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Visitors on a tour of the museum can also see images of farmers working in the production of silk and silkworm picking and collecting.The museum regularly puts on temporary exhibitions. For instance, in the past, it has put on displays for around 6 months, typically from May to October, displaying artisanal silks and weavings from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, and private silk collections from along the Silk Road, including China, Japan and the Middle East. It has also hosted private collections of tribal costumes of Eric Boudot and Teresa Coleman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Silk Museum, website for the museum in Bsous\nSilk Museum, Bsous, Lebanon, pictures of the museum and its grounds on Archnet\nPhotographs of the museum",

        "wiki": "Badaro  is a well-known residential neighbourhood and business hub in the heart of Beirut. The neighborhood is roughly bounded by the Pierre Gemayel avenue on the north, the Hippodrome on the west, Sami el Solh avenue on the east, Beirut's pine forest on the south east and the Tayyouneh roundabout on the south.\nBadaro is the common name of Beirut's \"Horsh\" (park) administrative district which also includes three parks: a 75 acres (30 ha) pine forest known as Horsh Beirut, the Beirut Hippodrome and the Pine Residence, the French ambassador's residence.\n\n\n== Badaro, the \"Village\" of Beirut ==\n\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighborhoods, a lovely place with leafy streets to stroll during daytime and recently became a nightlife destination. Badaro is within Beirut\u2019s green district, next to a 75 acres (30 ha) public park (the Beirut pine forest) and a 50 acres (20 ha) hippodrome. Opposite the museum, the tomb of the unknown soldier as well as a Roman era colonnade are part of a small garden with Byzantine floor mosaic. Badaro is a neighborhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner, with a village feel. The neighborhood residents, a mix of impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming caf\u00e9 and bar scene since early 2014 it has become a hip destination for Beirut\u2019s young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut\u2019s version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area. You'll find dozens of restaurants, pubs and sidewalk caf\u00e9s of virtually every style. At many spots you'll find affordable eats with the chance to enjoy your meal on the sidewalk. There are also some well-known upscale restaurants in the neighborhood. Badaro is also home to one of Beirut's nicest hotels, the Smallville Hotel, with its unique location next to the Beirut Museum and its stylish (design) interior.\nThe area around the museum square is Beirut's \"Little Paris\" as it includes most of Beirut's French facilities such as most of the Universit\u00e9 Saint Joseph campuses, the French embassy and consulate, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais and the Pine Residence, the French ambassador's residence, an outstanding 19th century palace known as \"La residence des pins\".\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to a widespread version, in the 17th century the ruler of the Principality of Lebanon, the Emir Fakhreddin,  planted pine trees to stop the advance of sand, south of the city of Beirut in an area inhabited by Christians and Druze. In fact, much earlier chroniclers report a forest of pine trees stretching from the sea to the northern border of Badaro. In the 13th century, William of Tyre called the forest \" La Pin\u00e9e\" or \"Sapinoie\". \nToday's residential neighborhood was planned after the end of World War I by French urban planner Michel Ecochard along the eastern border of the Beirut Pine Forest. The main street of the Horsh district was named after Habib Badaro, a wealthy industrialist who had established his textile manufactures in the area. The neighborhood demographics was radically transformed in the 1960s when wealthy Syrian Christian families from Aleppo and Damascus fled their country fearing arabization and nationalization laws. Many of them settled in Badaro which witnessed a boom in construction and a destruction of its pine trees forest. The neighborhood was nicknamed \"Wakh Wakh\" after a strange expression used by people from Aleppo and unknown to the Lebanese.\nMost of the buildings were built on stilts in a typical low-rise post-modern architectural style. Some of the buildings were designed by mid-century famous architects including French designer Jean Royere. During the Lebanese civil war of 1975-1990, Badaro was a frontline Christian neighborhood therefore resulting in the exodus of most of its inhabitants to Europe or safer parts of the country.Nostalgia of the \"dolce vita\" style cosmopolitan life in Badaro in the 50s and the 60s is reflected in many books of famous French writer Richard Millet: \" The Street of Badaro is an enchanted forest, every step reveals something buried (...)\"\n\n\n== Schools and Churches ==\n\nThe greater Badaro area is home to many schools and churches from different denominations.\nOn Damascus street, facing the Smallville hotel, lies the very pleasant Syriac Catholic patriarchate, a nice palace surrounded by a peaceful garden. Further on the same street, across the Museum of Beirut crossing and next to the French embassy, one can admire the Beirut's Greek Catholic Bishop's palace which was fully destroyed during the 1975-1990 civil war and rebuilt with the same limestone architectural style. The Sacred Heart of Jesus Maronite church is a modern construction located north west of Sami el Solh avenue while another Maronite church, Notre Dame of Lourdes, is located across Sami el Solh, on the south east side and is mostly attended by worshippers from the neighboring Ain el Remmaneh Christian suburb. \nOn Badaro street, the famous Notre Dame des Anges Roman Catholic church has a very nice mosaic fa\u00e7ade and is a reminiscence of the pre-civil war Lebanon, when Badaro was the preferred neighborhood of the many French nationals settled in Lebanon. Across Badaro street, one of the few Protestant churches in the country is attended mostly by the very small Lebanese Protestant  community. \nThe Sunday mass of the beautiful Franciscan convent adjacent to the Hippodrome is invaded  by dozens of Ethiopians domestic women workers.  The scene with its chants and prayers in Amharic can be watched from the street and is quite fascinating, especially that these Tewahedo Orthodox  Ethiopian worshippers are fully covered by white veils.\n\nThe street adjacent to the Hippodrome is home to four schools:  College Louise Wegman un upscale secular secondary school, College Saint Sauveur which is associated with the Jesuit Jamhour college, the Syrian Catholic Lyc\u00e9e du Mus\u00e9e and the Franciscan school.\nAcross Sami el Solh, the semi tubular Notre Dame church of \"College des Fr\u00e8res de la Salle\" dominates the Avenue.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn addition to its dozens of cafes, bars and restaurants, the main attractions of Badaro are its two outstanding museums: the National Museum of Beirut and the Mineral Museum (MIM). Jogging or walking in the 75 acres pine forest also known as Horsh Beirut is also a must.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's main business districts; Many corporate headquarters are located on Sami el Solh Avenue and, on the section of Pierre Gemayel avenue bordering the Badaro area, many high rise office towers were built after 2006, with some of the towers serving as headquarters to major banks. \nMoreover, Badaro is the very heart of Lebanon judicial and legal activity and is home to the Ministry of Justice, the Beirut Courts and  the vast majority of the country's law firms. \nThe neighborhood thrives on local residents, day-trippers, party animals, office and law firm employees and many expatriates. Thanks to the infrastructure works executed by the municipality of Beirut (sidewalks, roads, lighting) and the fact that many shops, cafes and bars are open until late in the night, Badaro has become, especially after 2014, one of Beirut's most secure districts. Unlike other areas of Beirut such as Gemmayzeh or Mar Mikhael, the rebirth of Badaro is not a process of \" gentrification \" ; The area, since the middle of last century, is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood albeit discreet and quiet, reflecting its history and the fact that the Syrian Christian bourgeoisie's reputation for discretion contrasts with the Lebanese taste for ostentation.\nAt the Southwest end of Badaro, the military hospital sector is an enclave.  It regroups barracks, a hospital, pharmacies, shops and cooperatives, dedicated to members of the military and the police and their families, locals and tourists can also come and shop in these shops and cooperatives, tourists are also welcomed and helped.\nThese families of servicemen come from all regions of Lebanon and are generally poor. They benefit from free hospital and medical care and can shop in affordable outlets and cooperatives. While the presence of armed guards can seem daunting, one should not hesitate to enter the sector and discover a crowd completely different from that of the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeirut\nNational Museum of Beirut\nHorsh Beirut\n\n\n== References ==",

French, German and Lebanese archaeologists rebuilt the temples. In 1984, Baalbek was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. They are described as being \u201cthe finest example of imperial Roman architecture\u201d.\nThe Jupiter temple is a six Corinthian columns of the great temple. It is a 22 meters high and is built on a podium. In this Temple, only six columns remain out of the 54 giant columns that originally surrounded the sanctuary. The little temple is found near the Jupiter Temple is known as the Temple of Bacchus it was built in the second century A.D. And considered to be the best preserved Roman temple of its size.\n\n\n== Castles ==\nLebanon is known for its many stone castles. Castles in Lebanon include:\n\nCitadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles\nCastle of Tyre\nTebnine Castle\nBeaufort Castle\nByblos Castle\nMoussa Castle\nMseilha Fort\nSea Castle\n\n\n== Cities ==\n\n\n=== Byblos ===\nByblos is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, tracing back to around 8800 years B.C. The city contains historical ruins including a castle and the church which were originally built by the Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries AD. The castle holds a historical story where it has been built, surrendered and regained by Crusaders. It takes shape of the Crusaders designs on the columns, their wall designs and the entrance structures. The castle has multiple vaults inside.\n\n\n=== Sidon ===\nSidon is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Lebanon, due largely to its historical sites. The two main cultural influences on Sidon were the Egyptian Pharaohs and the Greeks. The city is known for the castle of Sidon which is a castle on the sea that was built in 1228 by Crusaders. The castle was built on the remains of a Phoenician shrine dedicated to the God Melkart. This castle's location falls on an island in the Lebanese city of Saida, it is about 80 meters from the beach, linked by bridge building on a rocky nine barrages. The roof is usually used for sightseeing providing an exquisite view of the port and the old remains of the city. The city Sidon by itself has become a touristic destination because of its value in the history of the country as a whole and for the beauty of its architecture.\n\n\n=== Beirut ===\nArchaeological artifacts show Beirut was settled back to the Iron Age. Beirut was a city of glory during the Roman era. It then became occupied by different civilizations some of which were the Crusaders in 1109, the Mamluks in 1291 and then Ottomans who stayed in Lebanon for 400 years until 1916. The country then went through a period of French mandate until 1943. During this period European architecture was introduced.Up until the first half of the 19th century it was not as significant as other cities along the Mediterranean Sea coast (Tripoli and Damascus), and few pre-19th century landmarks remain, apart from some religious buildings. In 1831 Ibrahim Pasha established himself in the city in the wake of his struggle against Ottoman rulers. The toll road to Damascus was constructed in 1863, Orozdi Bek Department store in 1900, and the Arts and Crafts School in 1914.The city now features modern buildings alongside arabesque Ottoman buildings, as well as Roman and Byzantine structures. Beirut is famous for a group of five columns that were discovered underground in the heart of the city in 1963, found to be a small part of a grand colonnade of Roman Berytus.\n\n\n== Religious architecture ==\n\nRoman temples include the Temples of Baalbek, Temple of Eshmun and ancient temples in Niha.\nThere are thousands of churches in Lebanon that include but are not limited to: Saint George Maronite Cathedral of Beirut, Saint Louis Cathedral, Beirut, Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut, Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Bzoummar, and St. Elie and St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Catholic Cathedral. Deir el Qamar is home to a former synagogue. (Deir el Qamar Synagogue)\n\n\n== 19th century ==\nThe Beit ed-Dine palace complex was built by Amir Bechir El-Chehab II in the early 19th century. The palace entrance leads through the gates into an open space. This area was originally used for cavalry practices and for celebrations, which were attended by the public, visitors and important people of that time. The palace complex is now a museum with pictures, transcripts and documents including a collection of ancient pottery. It also contains a collection of Romanian gold jewelry, Islamic glazed wares, ethnographic objects, and ancient and modern weapons.Major building projects during Ottoman times included the Grand Serail (1853), an Ottoman Bank (1856, closed 1921), Capucine St. Louise (1863), Petit Serail (1884), Beirut train station (1895), Ottoman Clock Tower (1898) and an Ottoman department store (1900). Outside the city walls, Syrian Protestant College (which became American University of Beirut in 1920) opened in 1866. In 1883 the Jesuits also opened a university on the city's edge (Saint Joseph University). New primary and secondary schools were also established.\n\n\n== 20th century and Classical architecture to Modernism ==\n\n20th century architecture in Lebanon included the period of the French Mandate (1918-1943) and independent periods. Lebanon and Beirut in particular has seen large scale developments in recent decades, especially after the civil war ended. Some historic sites have been lost as new buildings are erected. Swiss architect Addor et Juilliard designed the Central Bank building. Maurice Hindieh designed the Ministry of Defense building (1965) and Andre Wogenscky Lebanese University (1960s).  The Museum of the Resistance is in Mleeta. Artisans House (1963) in Ain-Mreisseh and Electricite du Liban headquarters in Beirut.  Monastery of Unity in Yarze, School of Ain Najm, and SNA-Assurances headquarters (1970) in Beirut are other modernist examples.\n\n\n== Contemporary architecture ==\nInternational architecture firms have also played a role and 21st century projects include the New Beirut Souks by Rafael Moneo, Hariri Memorial Garden and Zaitunay Bay. The Arab Center for Architecture (ACA) was established in Beirut in 2008. VJAA designed the Charles Hostler Center (2008) in Beirut.\n\n\n== Residential architecture ==\nThe first residential houses in Lebanon were the Phoenician houses.  They were bricks and the roofs where always formed from huge rocky segments.\nThe perception deriving the method of building a house met some changes after the third millennium BC when the walls of the houses increased in height, some houses were built with stones, others remained rectangular and all increased in dimensions. The exterior and the interior walls where covered sometimes with mud.Lebanese houses incorporated the rules of the Ottoman Empire and the exit of the French mandate.\n\n\n== Architects ==\nProminent architects who worked in Lebanon include:\n\nBechara Affendi, an Armenian-Lebanese architect who designed Petit Serail, Menchiyyeh and the Police and Internal Security Headquarters (demolished in the early 1990s)\nYoussef Aftimus, Beirut City Hall (1933)\nMardiros Altounian (1889-1958), a graduate of the Ecole des Beaux Arts (1918) he designed Lebanese Parliament (1931), Abed clock tower (1934) in Nejmeh Square, Armenian Sanatorium of Azounieh (1937) in the Chouf region, and National Museum buildings.\nIlyas Murr (1884-1976), the first Lebanese engineer to graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1905), he designed the Art Deco Roxy movie theater (1932) in central Beirut.\nAntoine Tabet (1907-1964) graduated from the Ecole Superieure des Ingenieurs de Beyrouth in 1926 and worked in Paris under Auguste Perret until 1932 when he joined Jacques Poirrier, Georges Bordes and Andre Lotte to design the Hotel Saint Georges.

        "wiki": "The tourism industry in Lebanon has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for Lebanon. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as \"The Paris of the Middle East\" or also \"The Pearl of the Middle East\" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture, cuisine, history, archaeology, and architecture of Lebanon.\nFrom Stone Age settlements to Phoenician city-states, from Roman temples to rock-cut hermitages, from Crusader Castles to Mamluk mosques and Ottoman hammams, the country's historical and archaeological sites are displayed all across the country reflecting ancient and modern world history. Lebanon has a long-standing history of cultural tourism. Interest in the Lebanese Levantine culture was stirred following the visits of many European orientalists, scholars and poets particularly Alphonse de Lamartine, Ernest Renan and Victor Gu\u00e9rin.Lebanon's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. Lebanon offers plenty: from ancient Roman ruins, to well-preserved castles, limestone caves, historic Churches and Mosques, beautiful beaches nestled in the Mediterranean Sea, world-renowned Lebanese cuisine, nonstop nightlife and discoth\u00e8ques, to mountainous ski resorts.\nSignificant private investment is currently being made in the modernization and expansion of this sector and international hotel companies have returned to Lebanon. Casino du Liban, which historically constituted a major tourist destination, reopened in 1996. The largest ski resort in the country has been expanded and modernized. The Government believes that, because of the return of peace and stability to the country and with the development of the necessary infrastructure, tourism will again contribute significantly to Lebanon's economy. Lebanon's tourism industry also relies on the large number of Lebanese living abroad, who return regularly to the country during the summer season.\n\n\n== Citadels and Forts ==\n\nMseilha Fort is a medieval fortification situated north of the city of Batroun in Lebanon. The current fort was built by Emir Fakhreddine II in the 17th century to guard the route from Tripoli to Beirut. The fort is built on a long, narrow limestone rock near the Nahr el-Jawz River. Its walls are constructed with small sandstone blocks quarried from the nearby coast and built onto the edge of the limestone rock. The thickness of the walls ranges from 1.5 to 2 meters (4 to 6.5 feet). The larger limestone blocks are the only remains of an earlier structure probably built for the same defensive reason. The fort is approached through a narrow path and small stairway cut into the northern side of the bedrock. A small platform precedes the low arched main gate, secured by two loopholes and a small opening in the ceiling above the entrance. The main gate leads to a vaulted vestibule, followed by a narrow triangular courtyard, giving access to a small one meter (3 feet) wide passageway leading to the archery room of the west tower. The more elevated part of the fort is accessed through the east side of the main courtyard. A doorway leading to a hall, followed by three vaulted rooms, gives access to the eastern tower.\nCitadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles, also known as Qala'at Sanjil in Arabic, is a citadel and fort in Tripoli, Lebanon. It takes its name from Raymond de Saint-Gilles, the Count of Toulouse and Crusader commander who started its construction on a hilltop outside Tripoli in 1103 in order to lay siege to the city. Later, Raymond enlarged the fortress, which he named Mont Peregrinus (Mt Pilgrim). The original castle was burnt down in 1289, and rebuilt again on numerous occasions and was rebuilt in 1307-08 by Emir Essendemir Kurgi. Later the citadel was rebuilt in part by the Ottoman Empire which can be seen today, with its massive Ottoman gateway, over which is an engraving from S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent who had ordered the restoration. In the early 19th century, the Citadel was extensively restored by the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli Mustafa Agha Barbar.\nSidon Sea Castle is a crusader castle and one of the most prominent sites in the southern city of Sidon. During the 13th century, the Crusaders built Sidon's Sea Castle as a fortress on a small island connected to the mainland by a narrow 80m long roadway. The island was formerly the site of a temple to Melkart, the Phoenician version of Hercules. The beauty of the Castle can be seen in old illustrations of it; however, after bearing several wars, it has been damaged and renovated several times. It was partially destroyed by the Mamluks when they took over the city from the Crusaders, but they subsequently rebuilt it and added the long causeway. The castle later fell into disuse, but was again restored in the 17th century by Emir Fakhreddine II, only to suffer great damage. Today the castle consists primarily of two towers connected by a wall. In the outer walls, Roman columns were used as horizontal reinforcements, a feature often seen in fortifications built on or near former Roman sites. The rectangular west tower to the left of the entrance is the better preserved of the two. There is a large vaulted room scattered with old carved capitals and rusting cannonballs. A winding staircase leads up to the roof, where there is a small, domed Ottoman-era mosque. From the roof there is a great view across the old city and fishing harbor. The east tower isn't as well preserved and was built in two phases; the lower part dates to the Crusader period, while the upper level was built by the Mamluks. There has also been evidence of the old Phoenician city being buried under the sea in the area surrounding the castle, structures of walls, columns, stairways, remains of buildings, statues and cisterns.\nMoussa Castle is a castle between Deir el Qamar and Beit ed-Dine in Lebanon. It was built single-handedly by Moussa Abdel Karim Al-Maamari (born on July 27, 1931), a Lebanese visionary. It is the work of his life. He needed 60 years (21900 days and 394200 hours) of work. According to his biography, as a student, Moussa has always dreamed of building such a castle, and used to doodle his dream on pieces of paper in class. Moussa was not a very sharp student and his teacher Anwar used to make fun of him and tell him: \"You'll never accomplish anything.\" Moussa's crush, a Lebanese girl, used to say that she wants to marry a guy who owns a palace. Between 1951 and 1962, he prepared everything to fulfill his plan, including buying the land and paperwork. In 1962, his work of life started: He built the castle and handcrafted each of its stones and clay animated figures representing different scenes of the old Lebanese village life of the 19th century, making it a true work of a visionary and a masterpiece by all means.\nByblos Castle is a medieval castle in the town of Byblos, Lebanon. Originally a Phoenician stronghold, the castle was built over a white limestone cliff along the Mediterranean coastline of the town. It was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century from indigenous limestone and the remains of Roman structures. The finished structure was surrounded by a moat. Saladin captured the town and castle in 1188 and dismantled the walls in 1190. Later, the Crusaders recaptured Byblos and rebuilt the fortifications of the castle in 1197. In 1369, the castle had to fend off an attack from Cypriot vessels from Famagusta. The Byblos Castle has distinguished historical buildings for neighbors. Near it stand a few Egyptian temples, Phoenician Royal Necropolis and the Roman amphitheater. These are testament to the varied and rich history of the town of Byblos.\nBeaufort Castle is a Crusader fortress in Nabatieh Governorate, Southern Lebanon, about 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) to the south-south-east of the village of Arnoun. There was a fortification on the site before it was captured by Fulk, King of Jerusalem, in 1139 and construction of the Crusader castle probably began soon after. Saladin captured Beaufort in 1190, and 60 years returned to Crusader control. In 1268 Sultan Baibars captured the castle. The castle was named \"bel fort\" or \"beau fort\" (French for \"beautiful fortress\") by the Crusaders who occupied the castle in the 12th century. Its Arabic name Qala'at al-Shaqif means Castle of the High Rock (shqif is the Aramaic word for \"high rock\"). Beaufort provides one of the few cases where a medieval castle proved of military value and utility also in modern warfare, as its late 20th-century history shows. In the 17th century Fakhr-al-Din II took the castle as a part of his network of fortifications. Fakhr-al-Din II was defeated by the Ottomans, who destroyed the upper portions of the castle. The area was ruled by feudal families until 1769. In 1782 the Governor of Acre besieged the castle, captured it and destroyed many of its remaining fortifications. The Galilee earthquake of 1837 caused further damage to the structure and from then on the ruins were used as a quarry and a shelter for sheep.

The outcrop Beaufort occupied overlooks the Litani River. The river flows past the east side of the castle, which stands atop a 300 meters (980 ft) cliff which declines steeply to the river.\n\n\n== Old towns ==\n\nOld towns still form the center or core of many Lebanese cities and towns. The majority of these old towns dot the coastline of Lebanon, with only a small number of them found in the country's interior. This reflects the nature of the Lebanese people who were a maritime culture largely involved in trade and commerce.\n\nTripoli is the second largest city in Lebanon and is the capital of the North Governorate. Dating back to the 14th century BCE, the city was the center of a Phoenician confederation between Tyre, Sidon and Arados, hence the name \"Tripoli\" meaning \"Triple City\" in Greek. It was the capital of the last Crusader state in the Levant the County of Tripoli in the 12th century. Tripoli continues to be the second largest city, after Cairo, in Mamluk architecture. Tripoli was a major trading Port city between Europe on one hand, and Aleppo & Damascus on another. The old town of Tripoli is home to numerous historical sites like the Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles, Taynal Mosque, Mansouri Great Mosque and several other Hammams, Madrasas, and caravanserais. All of which are present inside the Souks of Tripoli, an expansive maze of Sandstone alleyways and narrow streets in compact urban forms. The Old City is decorated with elaborate ornaments, Arabesque designs, hexagonal cornices, molded door and window frames, and many other beautifying features. Elegant facades with decorative effects on elevations and around openings mark the entrances to old prayer halls, galleries, and courtyards. Simple cupolas or ribbed domes can be found over conspicuous and important spaces like tomb chambers, mihrab, and covered courtyards. Muqarnas and inscriptions, honeycomb moldings, and fishscale models decorate the minarets, portals, window exteriors, mihrab, qiblah wall... etc.\nBatroun is a coastal city in Lebanon and the capital of the Batroun District in the North Governorate. The name Batroun derives from the Greek, Botrys (also spelled Bothrys), which was later Latinized to Botrus. Historians believe that the Greek name of the town originates from the Phoenician word, bater, which means to cut and it refers to the maritime wall that the Phoenicians built in the sea to protect them from tsunami. Other historians believe that the name of the town is derivative of the Phoenician words, \"beit truna\", which translates to house of the chief. The Phoenicians founded Batroun on the southern side of the promontory called in Antiquity, Theoprosopon and during the Byzantine Empire, Cape Lithoprosopon. Batroun is said to have been founded by Ithobaal I (Ethbaal), king of Tyre, whose daughter Jezabel married Ahab. The city belonged under Roman rule to Phoenicia Prima province, and later after the region was Christianized became a suffragan of the Patriarchate of Antioch. In the 551 Beirut earthquake, Batroun was destroyed, and mudslides and cracks occurred at the Cape Lithoprosopon. Historians believe that Batroun's large natural harbor was formed during the earthquake. One of Batroun's medieval archaeological sites is the Crusader citadel of Mousaylaha which is constructed on an isolated massive rock with steep sides protruding in the middle of a plain surrounded by mountains. Under Ottoman rule, Batroun was the center of a caza in the mutessariflik of Lebanon and the seat of a Maronite diocese, suffragan to the Maronite patriarchate. Since 1999 it has been the seat of the Maronite eparchy. Today, Batroun is composed of an old town with numerous old stone churches and winding alleyways, all assembled around the old Phoenician harbor.\nDeir el Qamar is a village in south-central Lebanon, five kilometers outside of Beiteddine, consisting of stone houses with red-tiled roofs. During the 16th to 18th centuries, Deir el Qamar was the residence of the governors of Lebanon. It is also notable for its 15th-century Fakhredine Mosque, Fakhreddine II Palace, and other historical palaces and administrative buildings. The 17th century Deir el Qamar Synagogue is also in the village, although closed to the public. During its peak, the city was the center of Lebanese literary tradition. It was the first village in Lebanon to have a municipality in 1864, and it is the birthplace of many well-known personalities, such as artists, writers, and politicians. It was the capital of the Druze Cancimat of Lebanon (1840-1860). One of the most important historical and religious sites in Deir El Qamar is Our Lady of the Hill known as Saydet El Talle. This Maronite church goes back to the 15th century. The legend says that there was a Druze Emir in Baakline looking at the hill of Deir El Kamar. He saw a light coming out of the hill. He gathered his soldiers and ordered them to go in the morning and dig in the land. He said to them: 'If you find an Islamic symbol, build a mosque. If you find a Christian symbol, build a church.\" The soldiers went in the morning, dug in the land and found a rock with a cross on it. Under the cross, there was the moon and Venus. That was the sign that long time ago, there was a temple dedicated to the moon and Venus and later it became a church. Earthquakes and wars might be the reason for its disappearance.\" The rock discovered by the soldiers can be found above the old gate of the church. A Byzantine column can be found inside the church.\nZahleh is the capital and largest city of the Bekaa Governorate in east Lebanon. It is situated 55 km (34 mi) east of the capital Beirut, close to the Beirut-Damascus road, and lies at the junction of Mount Lebanon and the Beqaa valley, at a mean elevation of 1000 m. Zahl\u00e9 is known as the \"Bride of the Beqaa\" and \"the Neighbor of the Gorge\" due to its geographical location and attractiveness, but also as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\"  It is famous throughout Lebanon and the region for its pleasant climate, numerous riverside restaurants and quality arak. Its inhabitants are predominantly Greek Catholic and known as Zahlawi. Zahl\u00e9 is built upon a series of foothills of the Lebanon mountains, with Mount Sannine towering above it at a height of 2,628 meters (8,622 feet). Zahl\u00e9 was founded in the early 18th century, in an area whose past reaches back some five millennia. It enjoyed a brief period as the region's first independent state in the 19th century when it had its own flag and anthem. Due to its relative geographic isolation from the local centers of power in Mount Lebanon and Syria, the town did not have any significant allies in the region to fall back on in case of conflicts or attacks. Zahl\u00e9 was burned in 1777 and 1791, and it was burned again and plundered in 1860 during a conflict between the Christian population of the town and the Druze of the neighboring areas. The construction of the railroad line between Beirut and Damascus in 1885 brought prosperity to Zahl\u00e9, which became a freight hub on the trade route between Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, while continuing to serve as a regional agricultural center. The town is a vast collection of white-limestone houses covered with red-tiled-roofs. It houses several Ottoman-era buildings, several old churches, the Our Lady of Bekaa shrine, and a large saray. However, the most important attraction in Zahleh remains a 300 m (984 ft) promenade along a local river.  Sheltered between the ravine's limestone cliffs, it is lined up with outdoor restaurants, cafes and playrooms, and shaded by trees.\nSidon is the third largest city in Lebanon and the capital of the South Governorate. It lies on the Mediterranean sea, 40 km north of Tyre and 40 km south of the capital Beirut. Sidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. It was one of the most important Phoenician cities and may also have been the oldest. From here, and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonizing party went to found the city of Tyre. Like other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors. At the end of the Persian era in 351 BC, it was invaded by the emperor Artaxerxes III and then by Alexander the Great in 333 BC when the Hellenistic era of Sidon began.

Since the end of the war, the sector has managed to revive somewhat, but tourism has yet to return to its pre-war levels. Tourism in 1999 accounted for 9 percent of the GDP. In 2001, the tourism sector was one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy, with the number of tourists visiting Lebanon between 1996 and 2000 growing at the rate of 14 percent annually. In 2003 the tourism industry contributed 6.374 billion U.S. dollars to the Lebanese economy and in 2005 the receipts per capita reached 1,433 U.S. dollars. In 2004, the song \"Libnan\", written and performed by Lydia Canaan (who in 1997 was awarded the Lebanese International Success Award by the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism), was the soundtrack of the advertisement \"Rediscover Lebanon\", produced and broadcast by CNN to over one-billion viewers and commissioned by the Lebanese Ministry of Economy & Trade to promote Lebanon as a tourist destination.\nIn 2006 the ministry of Tourism counted 373,037 admissions to the country's main ministry run touristic sites. In 2009, Lebanon hosted about two million tourists, a record number, passing the previous 1974 record of 1.4 million tourists. The number of tourists grew by 39% over the previous year, the largest increase in any country according to the World Tourism Organization. Most of the increase is due to heightened political stability and security. Lebanon was also featured by several international media outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and  Paris Match, as a top tourist destination at the beginning of 2009. Lebanon's annual income from tourism reached $7 billion, about 20 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the Minister of Tourism.  Despite the recent surge in popularity as a tourist destination, the United States along with a number of other countries continue to urge their citizens to avoid all travel to Lebanon due to current safety and security concerns.\n\n\n=== Recent years ===\nOn August 16, 2015, during the 7th session of the Joint Jordanian-Lebanese Higher Committee, Lebanese and Jordanian officials signed a five-year tourism partnership program which includes efforts to promote tourism in both countries.\n\n\n== Arrivals by country ==\nMost visitors arriving to Lebanon were from the following countries of nationality:\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDewailly B., 2007, \u00ab Du cas et des \u201cK\u201d touristiques libanais : une communication g\u00e9ographique \u00bb , in Villes et Territoires du Moyen-Orient, Institut Fran\u00e7ais du Proche-Orient, Beyrouth, mars, n\u00b0 3, on Hal-SHS.\nDewailly B. et Ovazza J.-M., 2009, \"Le tourisme au Liban : quand l\u2019action ne fait plus syst\u00e8me\", in Berriane M.

          "The telefrique is from Jouniah up to Harrisah , 2 ways ticket , it passes through beautiful green mountains, the better is the green rosy stairs you walk up after the telefrique , the cabinets are clean and safe , a good restaurant zone is up there and the views are worth seeing",
          "Though it is possible to reach Harissa by road the telefrique from Jounieh is to me the best way to reach the summit.Release the inner child and enjoy the experience of brushing the tops of the pine trees and looking directly into mountain side homes as you ascend. The cable",

          "Though we had to wait a long time (about 30 minutes) due to long queues of school children, it was worth the wait. The view is amazing. It might be good to come early, before these buses full of kids come. The restaurants up on the mountain are not very interesting and it is",
          "The cable car ride was quite pleasant, from the cable car you can see a jawdropping view of Jounieh and the sea. What was less pleasant was the cable car suddenly stopping for 5 minutes. We were left stranded without any information. We later learned that Lebanon has scheduled",

          "a very cool day in a historical Souq and village of more than 7000 years Worth a visit due to its related history ... We visited Jbeil or Byblos with family and friends who enjoyed alot .",
          "It was amazing to walk in this old authentic area, it is full of amazing stores and wonderful products and met amazing people.",
          "I enjoy visting the old souk, especially to eat and browse books at a market. It is unfortunate that poor souvenirs are being replaced by knock-off shoes. At least the souvenirs spoke of Lebanon.",
          "It is a beautiful traditional souk, great opportunity to see some local products. However, be aware that Byblos is one of the most expensive places in Lebanon, so if you visit different locations, it is probably better for you to purchase souvenirs there. To compare, the magnets",
          "From restaurants to bars to stores, there's something for everyone in the old souks. Most busy at night when party goers fill these narrow passages, it's the pulsing heart of Byblos.",
          "This place amazing for all event summer and winter very social place U gonna bi veey surprised when visiting",
          "The Byblos Souk is very small and consists of a few bars, which are very pricey and shops, which are aimed at the tourists, who have visited Byblos Archaeological Site.",
          "Extremely romantic! Very sensual! Cosy, the tasty restaurants nearby make the feel ever better! Loved it! The crowd the people, the pavement! The design the architecture! Make sure you don\u2019t miss it!!",
          "That\u2019s one of my favorite places ..I like to see the old buildings,walk in the streets and watch people all around sitting chatting playing music..you can buy lot of souvenirs and clothes....very nice",
          "Whether shopping or eating the Souk is clearly aimed at tourists rather than locals but remains well worth a small visit/walk through when you're passing whether you want to eat or shop.",
          "The place is full of nice shops and places to buy very nice souvenirs. it has one of the most beautiful collections. one of the best places to buy i have ever seen",
          "This place must be the ending of Byblos tourism, at a time the music begins... Someone can walk and make shopping to buy gifts and souvenirs, and then have a seat to drink or eat something and enjoy the night life of Byblos and Lebanon.",
          "Cute place to see and stroll many shops and caf\u00e9s. Offers cover from the strong and powerful sun all while enjoying a shisha and mezzes.",
          "If it is your first visit to Lebanon, bear in mind that you MUST visit Jbeil's (or Byblos) Old Souk. In fact, besides the exsitence of thousands of vibrant shops where you can find different kinds of souvenirs, this Souk reflects the true Lebanese spirit known for its",
          "The Old Souk in Byblos is basically a series of souvenir shops in several narrow streets. It looks okay at first glance but it is rather tacky really. Definitely not a thriving Arab Souk you would be hoping for.",
          "The old souk has a great architecture spoiled by the congested pubs/bars and stores selling Chinese products, you feel the place is too commercial and wish they make the stores sell Lebanese traditional products instead of the current ones. There are no facilities or toilette's",
          "For an \"old souk\" it sucks. There are two or three tiny streets filled with bars and stores selling trinkets. Nothing original, locally made, or culturally relevant",

          "Where ever you turned your head you will find something to attract you. Beautiful little roads leads you to many ancient buildings and shops. Personally l can wonder around in this souk (market) for hours enjoying the breath of history and the lovely meals. I am not a smoker,",
          "The old souk is very calm and peaceful - no hustle and bustle that I was expecting. The Souk is very old but very nice to walk and experience. You can almost imagine how it used to be in the old days. There are a range of stalls selling everything from fruits, vegetables, to",
          "It\u2019s the place to visit when you\u2019re in Jbeil Byblos ! So nice and so romantic. Excellent location for family walks and at night such an excellent place to dine outside. A lot of restaurants, pubs , bistros.",
          "This souq is one of the best in Lebanon, very unique and very rich. You will enjoy a beautiful walk between old buildings, where old shops selling a variety of products, including clothes, shoes, traditional customs, kitchen ware, toys etc... And the most remarkable are the",
          "If you are lucky to have the time to visit the old city of Byblos just 30 km. from Beirut, you must stroll through the many shops located in the two Old Souks of Byblos. The main Souk of Byblos is more modern and contains many touristic items for sale and is found on the way to",
          "It is a nice bazaar. Perhaps not very large, and very tourist-oriented, but still it's nice, just like the rest of the city.",
          "that small place is big in everything you see in it. during the day, you can enjoy a walk by traditional, hand made accessories and souvenirs. and at night, you can come across many bars and seated pubs where you can enjoy a drink while listening to nice music.",
          "It's a decent place to walk around but it's not like an old time souk. Every single shop is there to separate tourists from their money and it is very expensive. Go to the souks in nearby Tripoli for a more authentic experience.",
          "If you\u2019re looking for fridge magnets or postcards this is the perfect location. The street sold random nicknacks that were pointless.",
          "They have plenty of things to buy. I got our souvenirs from here and they are great. Just walk up and down and down the souk and you'll enjoy it.",
          "The old soul of Byblos is so beautiful and authentic... we were passing through the narrow streets, full of different kind of shops selling all kind of traditional items and several restaurants... to visit absolutely",
          "A must do while in Jbeil / byblos area , the old souk was always a part of Jbeil citadel. Looking almost like the souks of the old agora of greece, the souk is a must do if you're looking to buy souvenirs or for a clubbing experience in sumemr",
          "Worth a look but don't expect the same atmosphere as Marrakech. Lots of little shops, some ok some just tourist rubbish, but ok for a walk through.",
          "Like many of the old bazaars around the world the Old Souk has maintained the physical features while filling every available space with schmaltzy souvenirs that you will be thrown away when you move, if not before. There are some nice cafes which are overpriced because they are",
          "Byblos Old Souk is somewhere with narrow streets many shops historical buildings and lots of cafes, bars and restaurants around! We very enjoy with our visit to Byblos. It was really amazing experience, we spend time walking around the city and have lunch then went to bar with",

          "The following review is based on our firsthand experience visiting the Byblos Souk from Jan 20 through Jan 22, 2019. My wife and I visited the Souk in Byblos several times during our stay. The streets are well paved and easily navigable. There are so many shops selling so many",
          "Modern souk that was able to keep the link with the past. It is touristy, so a bit more pricey, but quite nice to stroll around.",
          "Lots of crap like fake handbags and shoes, but the buildings are beautiful, lots of good restaurants too.",
          "This Souk provides you with a taste of the authentic culture. It's a bustling place where you can find shops selling clothes, toys, accessories and antiques in cobblestone walkways, adjoining also small restaurants, cafes and pubs. You can bargain merchants to get lower prices.",
          "Very beautiful place and touristy very old, beautiful items... Don't buy There or bargain the price down as they overpriced everything, it's insane... Lots of fake items as well, be aware",
          "The whole old town is quite beautiful. This includes the soukh but more so the restaurants and the bars. Its quite near to Beirut - and ideal day trip of you wish to venture out of town",
          "Daytime or nightfall, this quaint waterfront attraction nicely entertains. Cobblestone walkways, Phoenician ruins, tiny shops selling colorful knick-knacks, restaurants of every kind, al fresco caf\u00e9s and pulsating bars, with the historic citadel extending to the water. The",
          "its good old souks, where you can find good restaurants and shops. you can also find pubs and you can buy souvenirs.",
          "It's nice old souk every thing is old and alot of shops and restaurants very nice. To come here for all",
          "Byblos old souk is one of the oldest places in Lebanon. During the day you can find some clothes shops, shoes, accessorize, and souvenirs shops. Moreover you can stop by many good restaurants there. The important things in the old souk are the roman road and the castle, and you",
          "I would not call the an old souk. It is just tourist passageway selling trinkets. Nothing special here.",
          "This souk is quite small and most shops sell quite touristy-type products but it\u2019s proximity to the archaeological area and the original stone vaults of the shops make it worthwhile strolling along this quaint and picturesque shopping area. There are a lot of nice and cozy",
          "very nice place,to walk and watch things around you,nice for shopping,restaurents are good ,also music parties at night are wonderfull,in general jbeil traditional look relook is perfect.",
          "Place is quite, clean and nice but not really a place to make some buys of souvenirs... more coffee places and restaurant than shops ;)",
          "Enjoyed my walk along the old souk. Amazed by the colourful features of lebanese handcrafts & products.",
          "Had such a nice trip to Old Souk and the adjacent Crusader Castle. The Souk has a variety of shops with reasonable prices",
          "I was depressed really when I saw the local shops empty from tourists. I hope the people from around the world flow again towards this place. One advice is that you save to buy the souvenirs from this old souk especially the fossils. I like that they preserve the old style",
          "Beautiful postcard area but so expensive for anything so best to wander around but don't buy as it's a rip off.",
          "our guide informed that Byblos is the 2nd oldest surviving city with continuous settlement. An old dilapidated castle and the Roman pillars show the survival strength of the city. on the day we were there at Byblos, many marriages were happening and the place was bustling with",
          "The charm of old Byblos never ceases to amaze me. Probably one of the most beautiful cities along the mediterranean coast.",
          "It is a small soukh you have to walk through to get to the Crusader Castle. After the visit of the archeologic site, you can come back here to have a drink or go all the way down to the small but pitoresk marina.",
          "It's a magical place to step in , and feel more then 3000 years of history, It is attractive to archaeologists because of the successive layers of debris resulting from centuries of human habitation. The ruins of many successive civilizations are found at Byblos, one of the",
          "What a trip to Lebanon if you don't go see Byblos ( Jbiel) and walk the old Souks, leading to the fort... stopping for a coffee, a drink, lunch and staying for the music and dancing non stop till the morning! If you don't come here, it's like you never visited. So go, it's fun",
          "Asked for falafel and this was arranged even though it was not on the menu - excellent service - really enjoyed - nothing was done for you - very helpful",
          "It\u2019s one of the most quiet and authentic places, many small coffee shops and bars with gift shops , take a walk in the side roads to see the beautiful old houses and churches then take the road down to the shore and enjoy the peaceful Mediterranean",
          "As others said, it\u2019s quaint and attractive. But there\u2019s not much to it. It\u2019s not very big, and I didn\u2019t see anything unique to buy. (Unless you count the fossils, which age amazing, but I\u2019m not sure if that shop is considered part of the souk.) So, worth a stroll but done have",
          "In point of architectural view or variety the Old Souk is a must journey in Tripoli , a moderate long and covering dress is required or you will be very uncomfortable with harassment!",
          "Basically, this is for tourists only. There are numerous little, walk-in shops offering for sale a variety of goods, from clothes, pictures, ornaments, jewellery and other items. It's a useful place to go to buy some souvenirs or presents for the folks back home.",
          "This is one of the markets \"souks\" which I recommend to visit. the place is very cozy, wonderful and full of whatever you are looking for. I usually find there things that I could never find at any other place, people there are very friendly and they do their best to satisfy",
          "These are traditional Souks, and despite some shops selling a fair amount of tat it\u2019s still worth a walk through - amongst the bits and bobs you can find lovely and authentic objects, as well as enjoy the spirit and lively atmosphere that make these Souks infinitely more",
          "Every time we visit Jbeil, we had to pass by the old souk. It is spectacular fabulous place to pass by or shop souvenirs from. We always amazed by all these antiques on displays. Workers and owners of the stores that located on both sides of the souk are friendly and welcoming.",
          "BYBLOS one of my favorite cities and filled with cool restaurants, paved walkways and archaeological heritage.",

          "Byblos was my favorite place in Lebanon the old souq containing cheap and traditional shops with very friendly people. I would definitely recommend going to Byblos with friends and not family, it\u2019s not bad for kids or tweens but it suits young adults or generally older people",
          "A quaint souk, with scattered coffee shops and restaurants, you can find lots of souvenirs, and personalized gift ideas, towards the end (closer to the sea) of the souk there is an old church (ND de la porte, the Gate\u2019s lady), and as you continue down towards the mina (port) you",

          "Old souk area that has been nicely redone. If you follow it until the end it will lead you to Byblos Castle. You'll find pretty much whatever you need there in terms of souvenirs. Prices are in keeping with other towns in Lebanon.",
          "The roads are mostly bumpy pebble roads so be prepared if you have a stroller. A few blocks worth of restaurants and souvenirs shops. Mostly redundant items and menus. Nothing impressive to see, time better spent elsewhere to be honest. People here not as friendly as in Beirut.",
          "The old souk is ok. Some touristic shops and some open air pubs at night. Should be visited while in byblos",
          "The Old souk of Byblos harbours plenty souvenir shops and cosy restaurants and caf\u00e9s. It is very relaxing to walk around under the shades of sun protections within the historical oldtown of Byblos.",
          "Its a nice place but i did jot feel that its a grand old souq as it shows in the pics it is full of bara and a good place for night life",
          "It\u2019s around 45 minutes away from Beirut downtown , but it worth the visit, full of nice restaurants and many souvenir shops specially the fossils shop , it\u2019s a nice way to end your day, you need around 3 hours in here",
          "beautiful old souk full with character , nice and cheap items u can grab, amazing food, specially seafood restaurants. i go there every time i visit lebanon.",
          "Charming city with a lot of attractions, the old Beaufort up on the hill, an old Romanian theater near the old port of Byblos, in the middle old churches not far from a mosque the symbol of coexistence; the old building of the school and a convent; surrounded by a number of nice",
          "The location and the surroundings couldn\u2019t be more striking and pleasing to the eye. Quiet in the day - buzzing at night. Exorbitant prices in some of the bars.",
          "Nice souvenir shops. We ate at a cute restaurant at the top of the hill right before we went into the souks. We had the Mixed Grill sample and it was enough for 3 adults but we weren\u2019t super hungry. Our daughter ordered a chicken sandwich and it was very good.",
          "What an amazing experience to walk through the ruins and then through Old Souk. I was so surprised at what I saw.",
          "It is a great place to visit at nights during the summer time, the bars and restaurants are in the old town area offer variety of local foods and European dishes and music.",

          "I made a quick half day visit to Byblos and walked through the souk(market) plenty of interesting stuff, be careful prices are over inflated. I asked about a prayer mat and got told $40us. I was tempted, but said No. When I got back to Hamra I bought high quality one for $8us.",

        "wiki": "Beirut ( bay-ROOT; Arabic: \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e, romanized: Bayr\u016bt; French: Beyrouth, pronounced [b\u025b\u0281ut]) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. No recent population census has been conducted, but 2007 estimates ranged from slightly more than 1 million to 2.2 million as part of Greater Beirut, which makes it the third-largest city in the Levant region and the fifteenth-largest in the Arab world. Located on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast, Beirut is an important regional seaport.\nIt is one of the oldest cities in the world, having been inhabited for more than 5,000 years.  The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the Amarna letters from the New Kingdom of Egypt, which date to the 15th century BC.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with most banks and corporations based in its Central District, Badaro, Rue Verdun, Hamra, Ryad el Soleh street, and Achrafieh. Following the destructive Lebanese Civil War, Beirut's cultural landscape underwent major reconstruction. Identified and graded for accountancy, advertising, banking, finance and law, Beirut is ranked as a Beta World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayr\u016bt (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French occupation. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician Berot or Birut (\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd15\u200e Brt). This was a modification of the Canaanite and Phoenician word be'rot, meaning \"the wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The etymology is shared by the biblical Beeroth (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea) which was, however, a different settlement somewhere near Jerusalem. The name is first attested in the 15th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.The Greeks hellenised the name as B\u0113ryt\u00f3s (Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nBefore, under the Seleucid Empire, the city had been already founded and known as Laodicea in honour of the mother of Seleucus the Great. It was distinguished from several other places named in her honour by the longer names Laodicea in Phoenicia (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u1fc3, romanized: Laod\u00edkeia h\u0113 en Phoin\u00edk\u0113i) or Laodicea in Canaan (Phoenician: \ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd0b\u202c\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd03\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd00 \ud802\udd00\ud802\udd14 \ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd0d, romanized: Ll\u02bedk\u02be \u02be\u0161 bkn\u02bfn).\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nBeirut was settled more than 5,000 years ago and the area had been inhabited for far longer. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Fran\u00e7ais in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.Beirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.Beirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticised by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area.Beirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.Beirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.Beirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest settlement was on an easily defended island in the river that, however, progressively silted up and joined it to the mainland. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, and Ottoman remains.\n\n\n=== Phoenician period ===\n\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorisation was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\n\n=== Hellenistic period ===\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon in his contest with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the end of the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of this Hellenistic period. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control, however after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, veteran soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken.Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions. Consequently, the city quickly became fully Romanized: it was one of four Roman colonies (coloniae) in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation.\nIts territory under Claudius reached the Bekaa valley and included Heliopolis (Baalbek): it was the only mostly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia region, because it was settled by Roman colonists who even promoted agriculture in the fertile lands around Yammoune. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony. Its law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught there under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire. After the 551 Beirut earthquake the students were transferred to Sidon.The post-war salvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. Prince Arslan bin al-Mundhir founded the Principality of Sin el Fil in Beirut in 759. From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon, which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon, today's Lebanon. As a trading centre of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was overshadowed by Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197.  John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204.  He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512\u20131520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks.\nAfter Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\n\n==== Vilayet of Beirut ====\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Dr. Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\nThese families are:\n\nAll other families of Beirut are considered to have descended from one of those seven main branches, such as Nahhas, Yanout Inkidar, Hajjal, Hamza and others who derived from the Sinno Family (p. 14).\nSinno is considered to be an old family in Beirut, descending from the Muslim Leader Tareq Bin Ziyad.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Capital of Lebanon ====\n\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975\u20131976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city has somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has been host to the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant eight times, 1960\u20131964, 1999, 2001\u20132002.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.In the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) characterised by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, winter is mild and rainy. Summer is hot and can be virtually rainless and very dry although it can get very muggy, especially in August. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October - April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public garden ( sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact concrete roofs cover 80% Of the capital area.\n\n\n=== Quarters and sectors ===\n\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikha\u00ebl)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRemeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-BlatThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs.Badaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favourite hip nightlife destination.Two of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more common.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. The city boasts significant Muslim and Christian communities. In Beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups. At the end of the civil war the Copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. The original seventeen included four Muslim sects: Shi'a, Sunni, 'Alawi, and Druze; Twelve Christian sects: Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholics, Protestant Evangelicals, and other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholics, Assyrians (Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic), Copts; and Jews (very few remain in Lebanon today, but children of Lebanese Jewish parents may register as citizens at Lebanese Embassies.) Briefly, Christians are 52% of Beirut, Muslims 47%, and 1% others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognised by Lebanese civil authorities.\nBefore the civil war the neighbourhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict.  East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. The southern suburbs are populated largely by Shia Muslims, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian.\nThe city is also home to a small number of Latin Rite Roman Catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with Archbishop Paul Dahdah, OCD, as the apostolic vicar.\n\n\n== Beirut Central District ==\n\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country.\" It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, F\u00eate de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticised for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down  \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.Finally, the actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. With its seaport and airport\u2014coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates\u2014Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban, Lebanon's central bank, the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\n\n=== Banking and finance ===\n\nThe Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East,\" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).The largely pedestrianised Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-fa\u00e7ade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouch\u00e9, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouch\u00e9 Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighbourhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighbourhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighbourhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming caf\u00e9 and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.  There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath caf\u00e9s of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.Hamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighbouring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic Bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighbourhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colourful and chic caf\u00e9s amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totalling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.Many of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighbouring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organised, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialised procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\n\n== Government ==\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== International organisations ===\nThe city is home to numerous international organisations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes.\nThe American University of Beirut and Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph (USJ), are the oldest respectively English medium and French medium universities in the country.\nThe Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to the Lebanese American University (LAU), which is also, together with many of its programs, accredited by US bodies and considered lately one of the top universities in the Middle East. Beirut is also home to the American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), as well as the Notre Dame University \u2013 Louaize (NDU), Universit\u00e9 La Sagesse (ULS).\nNotre Dame University (NDU)'s degrees are becoming more and more valuable with time. NDU received its accreditation from NIASC in 2015.\nThe Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing the university colleges, university institutes and universities in Beirut and nationwide.Among the private secondary schools in Beirut are, College Saint Joseph Antoura, Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais, Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame de Jamhour, College Melkart, Carmel Saint-Joseph, Coll\u00e8ge Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Nazareth, Coll\u00e8ge du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Gemmayz\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge Protestant Fran\u00e7ais, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by ferry from Cyprus via the nearby city of Jounieh or by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC \u2013 \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.The ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.Beirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilisations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading centre of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.Beirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighbouring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.Planet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.In October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels\u2014priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a pterodactyl is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" \u2013 an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish\u2019n\u2019Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of M\u00e9moire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life \u2013 a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year. According to a 2010 study by the American global consulting firm Mercer comparing high-end items such as upscale residential areas and entertainment venues, Beirut was ranked as the 4th most expensive city in the Middle East and 15th among the Upper Middle Income Countries included in the survey.

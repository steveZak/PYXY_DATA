        "wiki": "The  Pontifical Basilica di San Nicola (Basilica of Saint Nicholas) is a church in Bari, southern Italy that holds wide religious significance throughout Europe and the Christian world. The basilica is an important pilgrimage destination both for Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians from Eastern Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe basilica was built between 1087 and 1197, during the Italo-Norman domination of Apulia, the area previously occupied by the Byzantine Catapan of which Bari was the seat. Its foundation is related to the recovery of some of the relics of Saint Nicholas from the saint\u2019s original shrine in Myra, in what is now Turkey.  When Myra passed into the hands of the Saracens, some saw it as an opportunity to move the saint's relics to a safer location.  According to the justifying legend, the saint, passing by the city on his way to Rome, had chosen Bari as his burial place.  There was great competition for the relics between Venice and Bari. The latter won, the relics were carried off under the noses of the lawful Greek custodians and their Muslim masters, and on May 9, 1087, were safely landed at Bari.  A new church was built to shelter Nicholas' remains and Pope Urban II was present at the consecration of the crypt in 1089.  The edifice was officially consecrated in 1197, in the presence of the Imperial Vicar, Bishop Conrad of Hildesheim, and of numerous bishops, prelates and noblemen.  Elias, abbot of the nearby monastery of Saint Benedict, was named as first archbishop. His cathedra (bishop's throne) still stands in the church. Mediaval Serbian dynasty Nemanjic were significant donors as well.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church has a rather square appearance, seemingly more suited to a castle than to a church. This impression is strengthened by the presence of two low massive towers framing the fa\u00e7ade. It was indeed used several times as castle during its history.\nThe interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by granite columns and pilasters. The presbytery is separated from the rest of the edifice by mean of three arches supported by columns of Byzantine influence. Above the aisles is the matronaeum, a tribune gallery for women, opening into the nave. The basilica was the first church of this design, setting a precedent which was later imitated in numerous other constructions in the region.\n\n\n== Treasures ==\n\nThe Basilica houses one of the most noteworthy Romanesque sculptural works of southern Italy, a cathedra (bishop's throne) finished in the late eleventh century for Elias. There are precious mosaic pavements in the crypt and presbytery. The ciborium, the most ancient in the region, is also decorated with mosaic; it has four columns with foliage, animals and mythological figures. The crypt, with 26 columns sporting capitals in Byzantine and Romanesque style, houses the relics of Saint Nicholas.\n\nIn the church there is a Renaissance tomb of the Queen of Poland, Bona Sforza (from the 16th century), from marble. The Museum of the Basilica has valuable works of art, including a collection of twelfth-century candelabras donated by King Charles I of Anjou.\nThe church was restored in the late thirteenth century, in 1456 and in the seventeenth century. In the twentieth-century restoration, most of the Baroque additions were removed, leaving only the gilded wooden ceiling, enframing canvases by Carlo De Rosa.\n\n\n== Feast days ==\nDecember 6 is Saint Nicholas Day, the main feast day of Saint Nicholas. On this day, it is traditional for the clergy of the basilica to lower a flask into the subterranean tomb of Saint Nicholas to extract some of the myrrh which is believed to exude from the relics.  Containers of this myrrh are sent all over the world, and believers have reported numerous miracles as a result of being anointed with it.  For those Orthodox Churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, December 6 falls on December 19 of the Gregorian Calendar, so there will actually be two celebrations of the same holy day: one according to the New Calendar (December 6) and one according to the Old Calendar (December 19). Both are celebrated with great solemnity at Bari.\nMay 9 (May 22) is celebrated annually in the Russian Orthodox Church as the feast day of the \"Translation of the Relics of Saint Nicholas from Myra to Bari\". \nPilgrimages to the basilica from Eastern Europe have increased dramatically since the fall of the Iron Curtain, not only for the feast days, but throughout the year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMain sights in Bari\nCathedral of Acquaviva delle Fonti\nCathedral of Altamura\nSanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBasilica's official website",

You\u2019ll sense it\u2019s magnificence as you approach it especially if you come down the old town road where the church first appears right in front of you from a distance.

          "When one has been around the web of narrow streets and alleys of Citta Antica, overhung with washing and overburdened by the havoc of time, one will comprehend that the Church of San Nikola is part of the canvas if it does not also embody it. It personifies the city\u2019s",
          "Such a beautiful place, and kind of random to just pass down tiny streets and find such a huge building in the heart of old town. It\u2019s lovely inside, so quiet despite the Bose sound system along the pillars, haha. Quite lovely, and eerie!",

          "Beautiful church, but so touristy that it gets irritating (people photographing with flash, groups talking loudly, people wearing hats and getting reprimanded). Also, consider the fact that the bones of St. Nicholas were stolen from Turkey 1,000 years ago. So much for respect.",
          "This church is more famous than the cathedral due to the tomb of St. Nicholas. The age of the building is not obscured by embellishments of the 17th century like many. It is massive and simple, impressive and straight-forward.",

          "There are some local shops as well, you can buy some cute stuff.... Restaurants have usually an amazing food, well priced and don't miss the local wine....",
          "The basilica is one of the best sights in Bari. Be sure to visit the grotto/ crypt beneath the sanctuary!",
          "We were strolling around Bari old town and got to see this bascilica. It\u2019s pretty impressive and the building is really tall. St. Nicolas was buried here. It\u2019s not gaudy as some of tge other churches we had been to in Italy.",
          "An impressive cathedral, dating back to the 10th century, later updated with various styles. Do read up on the stories around St Nicolas before visiting.",
          "Unique because this exquisite church is a meca for Orthodox pilgrims and tourists alike and arguably Bari's No. 1 tourist attraction. But it isn't Bari's cathedral and not the seat of the bishop or centre of the Church in the area. It was built to house the relics of St Nicolas",
          "Amazing place with beautiful architecture. The interior is spectacular and San Nicola\u2019s tomb was breathtaking especially since there was a service in process when we visited. A must visit if you are travelling to Bari.",
          "We stumbled across this cathedral by chance whilst wandering around the old part of the city. Actually we thought we\u2019d already been to this cathedral but it turned out to be for a rival saint! This one is fascinating as it\u2019s both Catholic and Russian Orthodox (for some reason)",
          "This is the basilica of Bari\u2019s patron saint (although there is a rival saint in San Sabino). The most fascinating aspect of this site is that it serves two religious traditions, the Roman Catholic and the Russian Orthodox. Saint Nicholas is revered in both, and a relic (a piece",
          "A very interesting church and less gaudy than I was expecting. The crypt was a bit crowded but I expected that as the remains of Saint Nicholas are there. I would recommend a visit.",
          "The relics of the Saint were brought here by the Normans in 1045? or thereabouts. The massive Cathedral is a practicing Catholic Church. On the lower level a practicing Orthodox Curch exists with many Russian Orthodox Christian Pilgrims coming all year. If your not a religious",
          "Right at the heart of this lovely Italian town. Take time to visit the wonderfully crypt in quiet contemplation.",
          "After three years I am back here. Same place, some peaceful in mind place. Cekling of church is pure spectacular: carved golden wood and religious thema of painting. Underground are the remains of San Nicola, protector of Bari. Sometime religious music are here. Sometime the",
          "The best of this church is the roof with a great work in the carved golden wood. Also in the basement has a russian church with some byzantine icons.",
          "The outside walls are pristine white. You can go into the lower part where the sarcophagus of St Nicola is located and it was packed with devotees so I could only see from a distance . The inside was a pleasant change from the many Baroque churches. Entrance is free.",
          "I went twice because this is a very special place. The tomb in the crypt which has been there since 1087 (the remains of St Nicholas were bought here for safety; he originally died in Turkey in the 4th century) is an amazing, atmospheric place. I also attended High Sung Mass on",
          "What a church, history like this well worth visiting. Best to have a guide take you in so you can appreciate the history of the place. Amazing decorative ceiling panels. Regards David B",
          "I don't visit old churches so much any more. I was glad I walked into this one. It has a very interesting interior with lots to see and admire - art wise.",
          "Finished in 1197, this beautiful church, with its mostly square shape was built of limestone. The interior has a unique architecture and the ceiling is stunning. At almost one thousand years old, it is a must see.",
          "It's located in the city centre so getting there is actually nice walk. One of the main sights, can't miss it if you go walking in the old city.",
          "I highly recommend to visit the San Nicola Basilica on Thursday morning, the saint's relics of Sint Nicolas are open one day a week.",
          "We were very impressed by this beautiful basilica and the way it had been restored to it's original state by stripping it of the baroque transformations which had been added.",
          "The best thing is the century old catacomb where Saint Nicolas has been buried. This Basilica is a must see when visiting Bari.",
          "With all the discussion about colonial and slave heritage, I like to see that San Nicola was brown, not white or black. Simple church but nice statue of San Nicola and interesting crypte.",
          "In this church you have to LOOK UP to see the magnificent art work on the ceiling. The sheer size of the church from the outside makes for a great photo op of you looking the size of an ant! Try to get there before tours from the cruise ship for this (between 1-3:30 when most",
          "Beautiful basilica with a wonderfully decorated ceiling and a very atmospheric underground catacomb.",
          "Beautiful place for visiting. I recommend! Do not forget to raise your head and enjoy the beauty of the ceiling painting",
          "I am an Orthodox and getting to \"meet\" Saint Nicholas was very important to me; the crypt is welcoming and inviting to prayer - however, if you are there only for the tourism, you can still have a wonderful experience thanks to the lovely elegant Romanesque architecture and",
          "Not to miss beautiful cathedral built to remember san Nicolas or as we know him, the original Santa Claus. Go downstairs where the oldest part is and the tomb. The old columns are still in great shape.",
          "Great church containing both Catholic and Orthodox parts. Very nice icon of St. Nicholas donated by Serbian king.",
          "Kind of typical medieval church except that this San Nicola is dark skinned. Interesting and enjoyed Mass too.",
          "This is a Catholic church run by Dominican priests, but its most visited section, the crypt with the tomb of Saint Nicholas of Myra (yes, THE Santa Claus!), has many Byzantine Orthodox elements, including a small iconostasis St. Nicholas is one of the most venerated saints in",
          "It doesn\u2019t look much from the outside but the beauty is all held within. The ceiling is stunning. The remains of St Nicholas are here and there is also some wood, believed to be from Jesus\u2019 cross. We aren\u2019t religious but did find the basilica absolutely beautiful. The crypts",
          "We have been to San Nicola on several visits to Bari, and never tire of the atmosphere inside, from the beautiful, simple Norman architecture to the amazing crypt with the tomb of San Nicola. I always marvel at the simple but attractive spacious nature of the nave, supported by",
          "The Basilica of St. Nicholas was built in the 11th and 12th century. The reason for the church was to house the relics of St. Nicholas which were taken from Myra, Turkey when it was invaded by the Saracens. The inside looks basically white washed because it had been redecorated",
          "Sorry if I\u2019m harsh, is just a bit of objectivity. San Nicola and Bari in general are not particularly interesting. Italy is full of amazing cities and town, with fascinating architecture and natural beauty. Bari is simply not one of them and as a consequence (my speculation) is",
          "Interesting church to visit in Bari the ceilings of this Basilica make the place different so worth a visit",
          "What a wonderful experience to celebrate mass on Easter Sunday in this magnificent cathedral. A lovely feel and welcoming congregation. Thank you.",
          "Very close to the sea and very easy to find on Maps, the church is beautiful. We viseted it on Palm Sunday while there was a Georgian (I think) service. I vas very happy to find orthodox candles there, and I took my time to say my prayes. Felt really in peace there.",
          "The Basilica and nearby museum are both well worth a visit. Loved the architecture, the history and the insight into this very old part of Italy.",
          "Very Impressive building. Nice architecture. Very close to sea shore. Many souvenir shops close to it.",
          "We went there while our short stay in Bari. A beautiful place in the middle of the old town. You should visit the crypt",
          "It's beautiful Basilica, i think anyone must go and see it if they pass from there. It's tourist attraction.",
          "St Nicholas was from Turkey but is the patron saint of Bari. He is the protector of the children and unmarried women. The ground level floor is Christian while the lower lever is Orthodox, and this is where you will find his crypt (and his bones).",
          "Square beyond San Nicola, Bari Vecchia, on a narrow peninsula by the port, dates from the medieval times, nice architecture, twisting streets, there are many restaurants, full of caf\u00e9s; it's a large historic center and very visited.",
          "Great cathedral Divided st catolich and ortodoxal areas . Very good chorus. You csm see the St Nocollo grave",
          "This basilica is dedicated to San Nicola, his patron, and in summer times in May, for the Sant Nicolas festival, and becomes the focus of attention for many pilgrims;",
          "A very modest Basilica. It is made of light colored stone. Underneath the altar you have a more interesting area.",
          "I liked his statue, but my beard is way cooler than his. The rest of the Basilica was very interesting especially the lower part which seems to be Orthodox. The structural features of the columns hold an interesting history, I am sure.",
          "Well maintained church with stunning crypt from 1000+ years ago with altar, icons and paintings focussing on St Nicholas. Every surface clear of dust and beautifully polished. Chapel for relics also very impressive.",
          "What a mix of simple and baroque. My first experience of an Orthodox Church in the crypt (closer to hell?) and Catholic above. Totally beautiful place and a great prevalence to experience.",
          "We aren't dealing here with a church as spectacular as, say, the Gothic cathedrals of France or Florence or Siena or Milan, but with an older, sober, dignified Romanesque building with an important history and special meaning for southern Italians and Russians (St Nicholas is a",
          "Perhaps the symbol of Bari, the Church of Saint Nicholas attracts pilgrims from all over the world every year. While I didn't go there in a pilgrimage, I could not skip this church. It's beautiful both from the inside and the outside, with very nice paintings on the ceiling and",
          "Even though the final resting place of St Nicholas may not be as opulent as one may expect, it is the significance of the place that gives it atmosphere. The cathedral is a bit austere with an incredibly contrasting ornate ceiling. In the crypt is the tomb of St.Nicholas, where",
          "This was our second visit but always a must see if visiting Bari. The internal architecture is impressive as is the unique facade of this basilica.",
          "Great to see the resting place of St Nicolas. A wonderful cathedral. Located in a small square an easy walk from the centre of town, the crypt is well worth seeing.",
          "Visit before Christmas. Quiet atmosphere. There is the tomb of Sant Nicolas. Placed in the old town of Bari.",
          "Arriving to San Nicola from the narrow streets of the historical center is always a surprise. With its magnificent facade appears as a giant in the middle of the medieval city. Don't forget to visit the crypt and the bizantine chapel.",
          "I was dreaming about visiting this place for a couple of years. Finally I got there this year. It was more than I was expected. The basilica is well located in the middle of the Old Town. There is an easy access to get inside. It is also easy to go to the tomb of Saint Nicolas.",
          "Nice church. Simply and not so big for the capital of mediteranian Italy. You can see Sf Nicolae tomb",
          "A landmark cathedral for Bari. Of course one must see it but shouldn't be burdened with great expectations. It is pretty ascetic. A little bit of twist comes from the single sculpture of St. Nicolas. Not really interesting.",
          "A translucent ceremony. Auster with constrained baroqueness. Fine granite columnade. No frilly imagery. Spacious. An odd cathedral with reconstituted originality. Access portal wide and open. An exercise in serene religiosity with fine materials mostly elemental.",
          "I never knew the history of Saint Nicolas and coming here and seeing his statue and church was really amazing",
          "It is a historically place very calm and cool. Full of history and safe. We went inside and learnt about the place. It is a church of Roman Catholic. The church was restored in thirteenth century. This place is important for Christians because of Saint Nicholas 4th century",
          "In the middle of Bari old town. Very easy to find and has free entry. The architecture is impressive, particularly the ceiling. Just stunning. And dont forget the down floor. You have to visit the crypt downstairs.",
          "Fabulous day out lots of interesting history busy place can do official tour or take yourself around",
          "Lovely is an understatement. An impressive structure that is imposing on the small square in front of it. The stonework is a joy to behold. The inside is equally captivating. A must see.",
          "Recommend to visit the ancient basilica San Nicola. Beautiful church and you can see the ancient pieces of art ...And leave the letter to San Nicola with your wishes",
          "The only thing I would tell you is that you should not buy a gelato right next to the church, the prices there are incredibly high",
          "Built between 1087 and 1197, this basilica has both western Christian and Byzantine influences. It is so characteristic of the various cultures and influences that crossed southern Italy. In addition to seeing the church itself, stay to participate in a service to better",
          "Nice old architecture, church with tomb of Bona Sforza d\u2019Aragona. It's in the heart of Bari's old town, easy to find.",
          "The cathedral has been redecorated , not always in a consistent style. A few places the old frescos are visible , that saves the impression a bit",
          "Beautiful church in Bari, The crypts are amazing. There were people singing when we were there, added to the experience.",
          "Lovely to walk around in the evening. Not sure what the lights are for as they weren't on when we visited in October.",
          "The outside is very plain but the inside is gorgeous travertine stone typical for Puglia. Absolutely beautiful. Many tourist who are respectful of the space and therefore very quiet. Don't miss the crypt below with St. Nicholas' bones. Many pilgrims visit this sacred place.",
          "Impressively large space. White travestine walls. Rather little decoration, but this does not detract from the sense of being in a house of worship. Cool, calm and peaceful",
          "This Basilica is important as it was built during the late 11thC to late 12thC to retain the bones of St Nicholas who is particularly venerated by Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians. The Basilica has been restored several times, the last being in the 20thC when most of the",
          "I can\u2019t say enough about this Basilica! Easy to find and probably the highlight of our time spent in Bari. Be sure to visit the crypt downstairs.",
          "An amazing place demonstrating the potential for religions to assimilate and coexist. The lower floor is for Orthodox worship while the upper floor is for Catholics. An amazing and inspiring building. We were privileged to visit when there was an Orthodox ceremony in progress -",
          "Great place easy to find in the middle of the old town. We visited October and it wasn't very busy. Fantastic architecture. Friendly shop selling St Nicholas oil and gift. Well worth a visit even for non believers!",
          "Simple, but beautiful, ancient church. Saint Nicholas' remains are here. The ceiling is stunning. I would recommend attending a mass here, if possible. The combination of this ancient church and the Italian language are remarkable, and the sound system is modern and excellent.",
          "This church has a light and luminous quality because the nave is very lofty, the design simple and the stone is a pale ivory. The ceiling is elaborately coffered and is about 500 years younger than the rest of the church which dates from the twelfth century. Don't miss the",
          "X- XI century basilica. Simple and beautiful. Very religious place. Try to go early in the morning to escape a larger crowd in the afternoon.",
          "Historic church with great architecture, very well preserved and restored, a must-see for Bari visitors (free to enter).",
          "Take a guided tour so you get the history. Of course Italy is full of churches so you might ask, why visit another. However, this church is not only beautiful but has a lot of interesting facts and features that make it unique.",
          "Many basilica in Italy are very ornate. This is far more simple but still beautiful in its own way. Well worth a visit.",
          "I like the style of the churches in Bari. They are quite bare, but beautiful, and you can sometimes guess that there were paintings on some of the walls.",
          "One of the must-see churches in Bari. Witnessed a wedding with all the trimmings and the gorgeous impeccably dressed Italians in attendance. Beautiful choir and very impressive church.",
          "Historic Basilica constructed in the 11th and 12th centuries contains the relics and remains of St Nicholas (pictured). Artworks on the ceiling (pictured) also worth the visit.",

          "We didn't really know anything about the Basilica so when we entered we quickly realised that it was a very special place. The basilica is lovely and there were many visitors who appeared to be pilgrims visiting for the religious experience. The relics on display are of",
          "one of the nice churchs in Bari. Spend time inside and go downstair you could sometimes participate to a ceremony quite private in this small place",
          "Both the exterior and the interior of the church are extremely beautiful, white stone, with a few things to alter the pure romanic style. The crypt hosts the tomb of the saint, venerated by many Russian tourists",
          "Visited the Basilica two times. During the second visit, we were lucky to attend the service. Thereafter, the access to the tomb of Saint Nicolas was opened.",
          "Good place to visit if you are a fan of churches i guess. Myself did not find anything too spectacular.",
          "After you get a stroll throughout the old town of Bari you will reach theis church, which is beautiful many religious people are visiting it.",
          "We were in Bari for just 24 hours. This church was a highlight of the Old Town. When we first passed it there was a wedding on, but we popped back later to find the square deserted and the interior of the church free to visit. Beautiful!",
          "I would love to have witnessed the sunrays pasing through the rossette window to create the reflected image on the floor..but even to hear the story how people flock to see the spectacular combination of nature and architecture was impressive.That is only one of the interesting",
          "Unassuming external structure masks the lavish interior. Gorgeous gold ceiling. Crypt underground holds the remains of St Nicolas. Access is allowed even during mass provided reverence is preserved. To get here you have to wander the streets of the old town, which are",
          "Definitely a must see place both from an architectural point of view and from a Christian one. A lot of detail and artwork is there both inside on the main floor and in the earlier crypt where the tomb of St. Nicholas is found, and outside with all the carved decorations. Not to",
          "San Nicola Basilica does not need an introduction: this is an ancient church which is in direct jurisdiction of the Roman Pope and it holds the relics of one of the most popular saints in all Christian churches, Saint Nicholas, who was the bishop in Lykia, now Turkey, whose",
          "My wife and I tried to book guided toward of the city however the timing did not work out. We were very pleased however with the fact that we could walk the old city and everything was in Italian and English. The Basilica is rich in history and a true gem. If you are in this",
          "For a Christian, the Holy Relics of Saint Nicholas is one of the holiest and powerful things that exists.",

          "We walked Old Town Bari and this was the first stop on our list. Just standing in front takes your breath away. The building is magnificent and seeing Saint Nicolaus' tomb is special Don't miss this!",
          "Set in a beautiful square with a large statue of St Nicholas outside. The huge basilica is built of the beautiful local stone that glows almost pink at sunset. Just inside is a stunning statue of St Nicholas - this is carried out to sea every year and returned to the basilica",
          "A beautiful classic basilica. Well worth a visit. Beautiful artwork and a unique altar with dual staircases.",

          "Beautiful church, less ornate with wonderful chapel below we watched beginning of a wedding which seems to be popular place for the people here.",
          "come to this Basilica if you are in town. San Nicola is the Patron Saint of Bari and if your family is from this region your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather probably are named after him, like my family",
          "It's a really pretty church; the ceiling is painted, and St. Nicola's bones are kept in the crypt. The weird thing is that the bones apparently produce this liquid called manna, which the town folks drain off in May when they have their festival for the saint, and then give/sell",
          "We were disappointed in Bari as there was nothing to see but we were glad that we have visited this church and did not expect to find the underground church with colorful columns and vaults. The cathedral is very old but kept well maintained.",
          "The Basilica houses St. Nicholas' remains so it is a sacred place for Catholics and Orthodox Christians. They are located on the lower level. The church was restored to it's original walls where all of the baroque art was removed. For some reason they kept the ornate ceiling.",
          "This must be one of the most spiritual places to visit especially the crypt with the relics of Saint Nicholas. Saturated in prayer and soaked in silence.",
          "I know it very well because I was born in Bari, the town where it is. I visited it more and more time and it is always fascinating, as well as the underground cript",
          "Lovely church in itself, with the most interesting twist of being shared by Catholic and Orthodox churches. When we visited, there was an Orthodox service going on in the crypt. The color and music of this service made it a special memory of this trip.",

          "San Nic\u00f3la celebrates the same saint as Santa Claus but, here, it is the Russian Orthodox version. Inside, the church is filled with Russian influence (and Russians, when we were there). The crypt centres on a figure of the saint and the main statue in the main body of the",
          "Costs a few euros to go to the script and is so worth it. The entire grounds is beautiful, we always stop in when we are in town.",
          "The main attraction are the remains of St Nicholas which were stolen from the Turks around 1400's. The church is in pretty good state. Take time to sit down & look at the very impressive ceiling.",
          "Not one of our favourite places to visit given the multitude of churches and cathedrals in Italy. It seems to have been rebuilt. In a nice old area with narrow streets and little cafes.",
          "A lovely place to visit with a real surprise of the crypts below. Attending Mass on Sunday was lovely and added to the experience",
          "A part from the sober beauty of the church, I was impressed by the devotion of the so many people going down to the crypt to kiss the icons or \"touch\" the miraculous colomn. The catedra and ciborium are rare witnesses of the sculpture of that time. If you visit old Bari, you",
          "Right in the centre of Bari's historic district this marvellous church is a must see to anyone visiting the City . Don't be fooled by its relatively low key exterior It's extraordinary ceiling paintings especially as well as , altar and shrine are very impressive indeed .",
          "The church is a wunderfull place to pray. When you are there you shouldn't miss the processions for the holy Nicolaus.",
          "This chirch was built uin the 12th century to commeorate that Italians have been thieves for more than a thousand years. Italians went to Myra and still of the legs and feet of St Nicolas and brought them to Italy and you can see them in this church. St Nicolas will n olt give",
          "Came here today on our walking tour. Very nice plenty to see worth a visit whilst in the old town. Very old",
          "This is a major focus of the center of old town and many paths lead here. There is a nice statue beside the church worth a look. Tip: Behind the church there are nice WC facilities. Follow the signs. Cost: half a Euro or so.",
          "For the week before Easter the Basilica San Nicola is the place to be! It is not Saint Peter's in Rome, but then this is Bari ... simpler and more low key.",
          "We could not be in Bari and not visit this Church! It is beautiful inside like many other churches in Italy. I am happy we got to see this.",
          "Cathedral is really very intresting. It is main place which you should visit in Bari. It is stone church with raw interior except ceiling. There is the crypt with St Nicolaus remnants.",
          "Located in the old town on the sea side, this cathedral is preserving the relics of Saint Nikolaus. The legend says the bones were stolen by a bunch of sailors from Mira (Smirne/Izmir), where the Saint was born, and transported to Bari. The cathedral is divided in several parts",
          "And his corpse is available for all to see in the crypt of this ancient church, a real gem of Byzantine/Norman architecture, like so many places in the old Regno. Very good value and easy to find ,and just about the only place in Bari where you can get the t-shirt, if that is",
          "Just one of those things that takes your breath away. The most impressive Basilica in the region, it's home to Saint Nicholas tomb. I think credible cultural and historical importance both for the city, and all of the Russian nationals Orthodox religious relic seekers. Unique",
          "Our trip was in Easter and we visited the Basilica just the same day when there was a procession of priests and people praying on the stations of cross. It was us a special moment hearing the singing and praying. The Basilica has a beautiful ceiling worth a visit.",
          "Quite popular with lots of tourists as well as locals. It seems that the Russian President Putin visited it a while back - he donated a statue of St. Nicolas, which stands in the piazza. Lots of historical and beautiful relics. Must-go in Bari.",
          "Very impressive...no flamboyant paintings or religious decorations just beautiful architecture...very striking",
          "This magnificent church has quickly won a place in my top ten anywhere - and that's saying a lot considering how many churches I've visited! The old city in Bari is excellent too.",
          "I am a seminarian studying in Rome, so every now and then I take a weekend trip to other areas of Italy/Europe that have historical religious significance. It was nice to pray where St. Nicholas is buried and see the Basilica.",
          "The Basilica itself looks quite plain externally - but the painted ceiling inside is breathtaking . Everywhere there is narrative in Italian and English explaining what there is to see : relics, sculptures etc. Upstairs is the Catholic Church. downstairs in the crypt is the",
          "We walked all over Old Town, which is really the best place to visit in Bari. This is one of the attractions we enjoyed. So much wonderful history in the quaint Old Town.",
          "The ceiling is incredible. The rest of the walls are Gothic-style. The crypt has some remnants of Nicholas from Myra.",

          "This 12-13th century Cathedral, although not as impressive as the San-Nicola Basilica, is definitely worth a visit. Especially its magnificent crypt happens to be open during your visit (sigh). Its elegant facade, mixing Roman and Gothic styles is matched by the equally mixed",
          "Romanesque church from 13th century. Simple fa\u00e7ade (just as Basilica), rather simple and uninspiring interior. But the real treasure of the cathedral is hidden underground - it's the beatiful crypt housing the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.",

          "Make no mistake, this is not like the biggest or most imposing duomos or cathedrals in Italy, but it is the best in Bari and impressive in its own right. What's interesting is location of the massive organ and the craftsmanship involved in the side sanctuaries and altars. The",

          "A wonderful building somehow made all the more glorious by its seeming lack of touristic polish. If you can get there when some sort of service is in progress it is even better.",

          "The building was originally built in Byzantine style in 1062, and rebuilt in Romanesque form in 1170 after the destruction it had undergone at the hands of William the Wicked (Il Malo) in 1156. It is the seat of the archbishops of Bari and dedicated to Saint Sabinus, a bishop of",
          "The cathedral is beautiful, a more refined vision of the more famous Basilica of St Nicholas. However it is the archeological remains underneath that will blow your mind. The mosaics are incredible as are the artefacts. Do not miss it.",
          "The cathedral is set in a little square a couple of minutes walk away from bari's centre. There is also a crypt inside the cathedral. Worth the visit!",
          "Very beautiful church with an amazing history. I won't repeat what others have said only to add that there is a self guided tour you can do in the basement where they have excavated what existed before the present church was built. There are mosaics back to the first century",
          "there was a funeral in the cathedral so we could not visit all the main place, but we liked everything",
          "The 1100's cathedral has been modified over the centuries, yet we'll preserved. The prize is the excavations underneath, from Roman up through the Christian centuries. The mosaics floors are a treat. Be sure not to miss the small section of the road that led from Rome to Lecce.",
          "It really is a beautiful building, with an incredible crypt, but what made our visit special was our meeting with Don Carlo, an old very friendly priest who told us about the Cathedral and gave us some nice presents.. He speaks English and enjoys meeting people. He seems to have",
          "the cathedral of Bari will never please those who do not appreciate art. the Romanesque style'' mistreated'' often is in this church a splendid example. now stripped in the main body of the Baroque style, you can clearly see the galleries, the wooden ceiling. Even more beautiful",
          "My friend and I walked through the old town down to the port and came across this lovely cathedral where a church service was going on. Love the way church is casually, and frequently part of European lives. Everyone was dressed up though, and we sat at the back wondering what",
          "Just admire all the fantastic stonecarving on the facade and the rosettavindow vith its curious animals around",
          "This is official the main church of the city since it is the site of Archbishop. Nonetheless, tourist who go to Bari are more aware of the Basilica of St.Nicholas. The cathedral, is close to the castle in the middle of the old town. Its exterior is quite similar to the",
          "Visited here via tourist train. Pleasant to walk around and take a few photos. Include in any tour around the main attractions in Bari, but you won't need more than an hour unless you are very interested in this type of church or architecture.",
          "The cathedral is great, magnificent, doric, simple.Visit it .It will offers you an unforgetable experience",
          "While this is not a cathedral of the usual European stature, it is still a very nice old church with a mix of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox design. It makes for a nice place to pause while touring Bari.",
          "there is free entrance to the Cathedral museum, which host lots of art masterpieces and mideval treasures. There is also a collection of Russian orthodox holy icons.",
          "No matter how big or small the monuments, churches or whatever you visit in Italy, this country will always surprise you! What a beautiful cathedral, simple, well kept and with a great architecture.",
          "Not as large or as impressive as the Basillica di San Nicola which can be seen from this cathedral. Apparently it is known as Bari Cathedral and is dedicated to San Sabinus. Built in the late 12th century and early 13th century, beautiful but because there was a service going on",
          "If you are visiting Bari do not miss seeing this cathedral. Located in the Old Town section near the Basilica of St. Nicholas in the heart of the city, the surrounding streets make a lovely stroll through an ancient area. The cathedral is not particularly ornate nor bright in",
          "Not as ornate as many Catholic churches, it has some interesting Roman architecture. The crypt is very interesting. There is not much difference inside than in the Basilica di San Nicola. In one of these two, they get oil from the body of Saint Nick and sell it in the gift shop.",
          "Bari is a pleasant town and worth taking the time to look around. The cathedral is not world class, but is well worth a visit.",
          "This Cathedral is filled with centuries of history. The standing building is beautiful - take time to walk the whole thing, then go down stairs. For just a couple of Euros you can go through the terrifically excavated crypt and see graves and floors from 1100! Bari is a neat",
          "If you think the Basilica di San Nicola fulfills your curiosity for churches and Romanesque architecture think again. The Cathedral is only a few minutes walk from St. Nicholas and you get there while enjoying the beautiful narrow streets of the old town and the scores of ladies",
          "I've been to a lot of churches (love architecture), and this place has beautiful columns inside, each one different from the other. Check out the pews, it reminded me of Japanese carpentry at it's best."

Built around 1132 by Norman King Roger II, it is currently used for exhibitions.\n\n\n== History ==\nProbably built in 1132 by Norman King Roger II, it was destroyed in 1156 by king William I of Sicily and rebuilt and reinforced in 1233 by the Holy Roman emperor Fredrick II. During the Angevin domination, it went through several transformation, and after being acquired by Duke Ferdinand of Aragon, was donated to the Sforza family and passed to Bona Sforza, Queen of Poland. After Bona's death, it was returned under the King of Naples and transformed into a prison and barracks.\nThe castle is surrounded by a moat on all sides, except the northern section, which was bordering the sea and can be accessed from the bridge and the gate on the southern side. It is mainly composed of the Aragon walls and the main Hohenstaufen tower, and is currently used for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Francis and the Emperor ==\nAccording to the tradition, in 1221 Emperor Frederick II met St. Francis of Assisi in this castle. According to tradition, the emperor had a courtesan sent to Francis's room and watched through a peephole to see what would happen. When Francis sent the woman away, Frederick was impressed with his principles; the two spent the rest of the night in conversation. This story is not confirmed beyond doubt, but it is considered believable.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Teatro Petruzzelli is the largest theatre of the city of Bari and the fourth Italian theatre by size.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The birth and the golden age ===\nThe history of the Teatro Petruzzelli of Bari begins when Onofrio and Antonio Petruzzelli, traders and ship builders of Trieste, presented the designs for the theatre drawn up by their brother-in-law, the engineer Angelo Bari Cicciomessere (then Messeni) to the city of Bari.  The proposal for building the Petruzzelli was accepted and, on 29 January 1896, a contract was signed between the family and the city administration. Two years later, in October 1898, work began and it ended in 1903.\nThe interior of the theatre was painted by Raffaele Armenise. On completion the Teatro Petruzzelli overtook the Teatro Comunale of Corato as the largest theatre of Apulia. The theatre was inaugurated on Saturday, 14 February 1903 with Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.\nIn the 1980s, the theatre hosted two major operatic debuts, that of Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride by Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni which had never been presented after its debut in Paris in 1779, and the Neapolitan version of Bellini's I Puritani, which was written for Maria Malibran but was never performed by her. Both events contributed to making the city world-famous.\nIn addition to operas, ballets and big concerts were presented. Many great international artists have performed at the Petruzzelli: these include Tito Schipa, Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Nureyev, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Liza Minnelli, Juliette Gr\u00e9co. Great Italian artists include Eduardo De Filippo, Riccardo Muti, Carla Fracci, Luciano Pavarotti, Piero Cappuccilli and Giorgio Gaber.\nThe Petruzzelli also hosted important concerts of light music (among others concerts by Paolo Conte and Ornella Vanoni) and it was the headquarters of Azzurro, a musical programme, for almost all of the 1980s. The interior was also used as a location by directors such as Franco Zeffirelli and Alberto Sordi, whose Polvere di stelle was shot there.\n\n\n=== The burning and reconstruction ===\nDuring the night of 26 and 27 October 1991 the theatre was completely destroyed by fire, the result of arson. The last opera presented was Norma. \n\n \nThe criminal trial of those accused of setting the fire ended with the acquittal of the defendants and the condemnation of the perpetrators of the incident.\nA civil action followed which involved the Messeni Nemagna family and temporary manager Fernando Pinto, who was accused of failing to insure the theatre, ended with his conviction and the order to pay compensation of 57 billion lire in favour of the owners of the theatre. On 21 November 2002 the Ministry for Heritage and Cultural Activities signed a \"Protocol of Understanding\" between the family that owned the theatre and the City, the Province of Bari and the Apulia Region, stating that the theatre would be rebuilt by 22 November 2006.\nHowever, since the work of reconstruction never started, on 3 October 2006 the Theatre become the property of the Municipality of Bari in accordance with an Article related to the Finance Act of 2006.  But on 30 April 2008 the Constitutional Court, in its decision No. 128/2008\nordered that the Theatre be given back to the Messeni Nemagna family.\nThe Petruzzelli, reconstructed entirely with public money in 2008, was returned to the City of Bari on 7 September 2009 for breach of article 5 of the contract dated 29 January 1896 between the City of Bari and Antonio Onofrio and Petruzzelli. The article stated: \"In the event that the building collapses because of an earthquake, fire or for any other cause, the grantee and its successors would have the right to rebuild the Politeama to its original state, provided that the work was undertaken within a year and be completed in three years from the date on which the collapse has occurred, or have a duty to clear the land and leave it free of debris and return it to the City within a year counting from the above term.\"\nThe Fondazione Lirico Sinfonica Petruzzelli e Teatri di Bari was eventually identified as the only entity able to assume the management, maintenance and insurance of the Teatro Petruzzelli, based on what was written in former Article 23 of Law 800, which states that municipalities must make theatres available for opera companies after the end of concert seasons. The Teatro Petruzzelli officially reopened Sunday 4 October 2009, nearly 18 years after the fire, with a performance of the Ninth Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven by the Orchestra of the Province of Bari, conducted by Fabio Mastrangelo.\nOn 6 December 2009 the first opera season in the re-built theatre began with Turandot by Giacomo Puccini, directed by Roberto De Simone, the orchestral under the direction of Maestro Renato Palumbo.\n\n\n=== Announcement of cancellation of planned programmes ===\nDue to the economic situation in Italy, it was announced that the opera house has cancelled its October and November 2014 presentations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTeatro Margherita\nTeatro Piccinni\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrief history of the theater\nWebsite relating to the book \"The Theater of Deception\" which tells the story of the fire and the reopening of the theatre\n\"Last Act\" \u2013 The burning of Petruzzelli La Storia siamo noi \u2013 RAI Educational",

          "This is the 4th largest opera house in Italy. Beautiful interior, but uncomfortable seats unless you are on the floor or in a box. I've seen opera in New York and London, but the singing and audience reactions here (we saw Tosca) blow them away. It's very interesting to",

          "You'd never know it to look at it from the outside, but the Teatro Petruzelli shines like a jewel once viewed from inside. The acoustics are only surpassed by the 5-tier elegance. I recently was seated up high for a piano concert and was amazed at the clarity of sound. They did",
          "After a long period of uncertainty when a fire almost destroyed completely the building, the theatre is now been restored to its original glory and is enjoying new vibrancy with both classical and more contemporary seasons. A real gem for culture in Bari.",

          "as you know this theatre has been burnt and rebuild . it is really great but the shows are few and above all operas and ballet .",
          "To be honest, we almost accidentally found this beautiful building and became intrigued by its splendor and history. The theatre is named after brothers Petruzzelli, Onofrio and Antonio, whose designs were accepted by the city administration in 1986 and was inaugurated in 1903.",
          "Excellent orchestral and opera performances of a high standard. The theatre itself has been renovated relatively recently, and is delightful, with an excellent acoustic",

        "wiki": "Caterina Davinio (born Maria Caterina Invidia; 25 November 1957, Foggia) is an Italian poet, novelist and new media artist. She is the author of works of digital art, net.art, video art and was the creator of Italian Net-poetry in 1998.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Foggia, Davinio grew up in Rome since 1961. She studied literature and art history (student of Giulio Carlo Argan) at Rome University La Sapienza, where, in 1981, she received a MA degree in Italian Literature. Davinio began to write poetry when she was fourteen years old. In Rome she came in contact with the international circuit of experimental poetry and art, resulting in a number of collaborations with renowned artists, critics and poets of the avant-garde. Since 1997 she has been living in Monza and Lecco, working at an international level.\nFrom the early 1990s Davinio was a pioneer of Italian electronic poetry, in the experimental field among writing, visual art, and new media, using computer, video, digital photography and the Internet. She was the first woman artist who utilized the computer and Internet in literature and poetry in Italy. Author of visual and sound poetry, she also created works using traditional techniques, such as painting and photography. She is author of novels, books of poetry, essays, and has received literary awards and recognition in Italy and abroad.\nIn 1997 she collaborated to netOper@, the first Italian interactive work for the web, by the composer Sergio Maltagliati. She also initiated Net-poetry in Italy, in 1998, with the website and network Karenina.it. The participants included Julien Blaine, Clemente Padin, Philadelpho Menezes, Mirella Bentivoglio, Lamberto Pignotti, Eugenio Miccini, and many other new media artists, critics, and experimental poets.Her art has been featured in more than three hundred international exhibitions and festivals, among them two editions of the Biennale de Lyon, the Biennale of Sydney (on-line events), the Athens Biennial, E-Poetry (University SUNY Buffalo, NY, and Barcelona), Polyphonix Festival (Barcelona and Paris), seven times in the Venice Biennale and collateral events, where she collaborated also as a curator.She exhibited animated digital poetry works - called \"Terminal Videopoems\" - in the 1997 Venice Biennale, in VeneziaPoesia, a project directed by the poet and writer Nanni Balestrini.\nIn 1999 she participated, as a poet and a video artist, at the events organized by \"Progetto Oreste\" at the 48th Venice Biennale, where she also curated a video poetry exhibition.Davinio's net-poetry participated in the Venice Biennale also in 2001 - Harald Szeemann curator - in the context of Bunker Poetico, which was a collaborative installation - involving 1000 international poets and artists - created by the architect Marco Nereo Rotelli in cooperation with Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Filosofici of Venice, Massimo Don\u00e0, I Quaderni del Battello Ebbro publisher, Caterina Davinio, Milanocosa cultural association, and others. Davinio engaged in this project renown avant-garde poets and organized a virtual happening on-line called \"Parallel Action-Bunker\", simultaneous with real readings and performances at Orsogrill delle Artiglierie, a venue of the Venice Biennial.In 2005 she created the net-poetry work \"Virtual Island\", a web site and poetry network, in the context of the 51st Venice Biennale.Virtual Island involved 500 international poets, among them: Adunis, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Alda Merini, Fernanda Pivano, and many other established writers.In 2009 she created the virtual installation The First Poetry Space Shuttle Landing on Second Life and other on-line happenings in the 53rd Venice Biennale Collateral Events, engaging more than 200 poets from around the world, to celebrate the centenary of Italian Futurism. In the same project she curated also the event Network Poetico Net-Poetry Reading in Webcam, a poetry reading in Skype videocall with poets from various continents and countries. In the context of the 2009 Venice Biennale Davinio participated also in the exhibition D\u00e9tournement Venise 2009.In 2014 she exhibited her net-poetry installation \"Big Splash\" in the \"Master Section\"  of the international festival OLE.01, dedicated to electronic literature, in the Doric Room of the Royal Palace of Naples; The festival took place in many institutional spaces of Naples in October 2014 and involved some of the main international pioneers of electronic literature and experts and scholars in that field.Among the literary critics who have written about Davinio's works of fiction and poetry: Francesco Muzzioli, Dante Maffia, Ivano Mugnaini, David W. Seaman; some of the critics who have been interested in her work of digital poetry and electronic art are: Eugenio Miccini, Lamberto Pignotti, Jorge Luiz Antonio, Christopher Thompson Funkhouser, Marco Maria Gazzano, and others.\n\n\n== Karenina.it ==\nNet-poetry project Karenina it (1998) was the first art-poetry-communication project presented on the web in an Italian context; the website was not a simple cultural on-line journal, but a \"space of aggregation\", which hosted an ongoing discourse, involving emerging and established experimental artists, critics, and visual poets. The communication aspect was treated as an artistic medium that goes beyond the contents or the quality of the words: borders among art, critic, and communication, in Davinio's own concept, were cancelled. The flow of words and information became art in itself, transcending the necessity to view art in traditional terms of form.\nThe suffix \".it\" present in Karenina.it title is a geographic locator for the origin of the website. The value of the site resides within the conceptual framework of the Fluxus art movement.\"\nKarenina.it won MAD03 Award (section Net-Zin) in 2003, Madrid.\n\n\n== Other Net.art Works ==\nOther Davinio\u2019s net-poetry and net.art performances and events are based on the evolution of the multi-located structure experimented with Parallel Action-Bunker, mentioned before: beyond the simple presence of the performer on stage, performance is considered a collaborative, decentralized, multi-located action; poetry is conceived as \"social structure, e-communication, real/virtual interaction\", and \"e-communication\" is assumed as a new material for the artist.\nAmong them:\n\nGlobal Poetry, for UNESCO, 22\u201327 March 2002 (Rhizome Art Database, NYC, USA); 122 involved artists. Simultaneous performances in Brazil, Germany, Greek, Italy, Russia, Uruguay, USA, Venezuela, and other countries.\nCopia dal vero (Paint from Nature), February (Giubbe Rosse, Florence, I) and June (Eglise Anglicaine, Ajaccio, F) 2002, about the Twin Towers attack (archived in Rhizome.org Database, NYC, USA).

Isola della Poesia and Virtual Island were created in collaboration with the national newspaper La Repubblica in the context of the 51st Venice Biennale. Virtual Island involved 500 international poets, among them many established and emerging writers.\nThe First Poetry Shuttle Landing on Second Life, virtual installation (4 June \u2013 22 November 2009); it was created to celebrate the centenary of Italian Futurism. On the fortieth anniversary of the first lunar landing (20\u201321 July 2009) there was a landing of poets on Second Life (in form of colorful prisms which donated a poem file). The space shuttle was presented in the framework of the 53rd Biennale di Venezia, in the collateral event MHO_Save the Poetry. In the same context Davinio created Network Poetico_Net-Poetry Reading in Web Cam, a collaborative performance with poets from around the world, connected by webcam and Skype.

          "Here in the morning you may find the local fishermen unload their barks, you can buy fresh fish and other seafood directly from them. Also, the fish market is on the other side of the port.",
          "Great place, especially the \"old town\" with lots of little shops and bars in the tiny streets. Nice modern restuarants and bars in the main town plus easy to get around on local buses for 1 Euro a ride.",
          "Very nice small town to take a walk at night. A lot of shops, restaurants, crowded with tourists. There is a square where some times the music band plays live.",

          "In the port yoou can see of boats painted predominantly in azzurro blue, belong to local fishermen - a special species. As you look from theater to Lungomare, you will see a small fish market and seafood. The fishermen come out in the morning in the open, they catch the octopus,",
          "Nice place with all the colorful fishing boats... A good place to enjoy the sea view... Reminded me with Alexandria, Egypt with the same view and boats",
          "Located right next to Citte Vecchia, with it's resident colourful fishing boats, yatchs and cruisers moored across the bay: it casts a beautiful sight at night!",
          "Amazing place to sit and relax. Nice view. Close to town centre and the beach. You have to go there .",
          "Pitoresque place with colored boats and fishermen who sell directly on the waterfront fresh seafood. Nice view of the port from the terrace of Teatro Margarhita.",
          "Small port with some authentic, colorful boats (not sure if they are still in use.). Close to the old center, and the Teatro Margarhita, which has a terrace overlooking the old port.",
          "It's not a pretty marina, certainly not worth a visit just to see it! few local boats, few benches and the sea to look at.",
          "Here in the mornings you can see fishermen landing in small wooden boats with their catch. They sell it directly on the waterfront. You can buy for instance oysters for 10 euros. And if you do not want oysters, you can just enjoy the sea breeze and the unique smell of the sea.",
          "We love walking along the water with palm trees and boats, so we often went there. Mostly it was relaxing, but on the weekend some event was happening and it because a hustle and bustle area with road blockages and lots of food stands going up. Exciting.",
          "In the morning it is very enjoyable to watch the fishermen bringing in their catch and setting it up for sale on small tables. They beat the octopus either by slamming it against the pavement or hitting it with a club. It is very much a men\u2019s affair. They sit about after the",

          "An early evening walk provided a relaxing atmosphere but not much was going on. Nevertheless the area is pleasant and a good place to spend some time watching the small boats bobbing in the water with the port on one side and the backdrop of the old city on the other. Some",
          "There were not too many pedestrians strolling along the harbor other than some joggers in early morning. We were there on a weekend and there were only a couple of fishermen selling their catch. The blue colored wooden fishing boats moored at the bay characterized an Italian",
          "My wife and I enjoyed the sights however the water was replete with garbage. The people of Bari, were warm and friendly. The harbour however should be cleaned up garbage which is everywhere \u2013 in the water on the porches etc.",
          "The harbour area is typical Italian lots going on especially when the fishermen come in and set up their stalls to sell the catch of the day. The smell of the see and the animation is worth experiencing. Just wished I had a cooker as I would have been knee deep in fresh fish",
          "We took a walk around the waterfront at night and it looked magical. Just what you think it should be in your mind. The boats...the colors and everything lit up. Seeing the life of Bari and everyone out on a Saturday night made it amazing!!",

          "This is a definite must to go in Bari if you like the sea, fishing and seafood. Early in the morning you can watch fishermen at work and eat their fresh produce. We bought a plate of ousters and another of sea urchins (ricci) with the combined price of 10 \u20ac. Wonderful taste!",
          "Just next door to the ancient part of the city, the Porto Vecchio has its own charms that are worth discovering. As in any small port, you'll find the colorful fishers' boats that please the eye and tease the stomach. As the old port is the kingdom of the seafood: If you drop",

          "Nothing special unless you are a religious person which we are not. Big cathedral and the way there is filled with tourist trap stuff.",
          "Loved being here and seeing this citadel. From the floor to ceiling this citadel is a master peace. Loved being here and walking through.",
          "This basilica is impressively large, with a simple, yet beautiful facade. We didn't enter, as it was closed, but it was a nice view.",
          "Visited here by guided tour. Beautiful architecture and great history in centre of bari. Very nice at night and don't miss to visit the crypt",
          "Well worth a visit. The remains of Saint Nicholas are there and it is the spiritual place of Bari. The ceiling in the Basilica is spectacular.",
          "The North Pole may be the physical home of Santa but this is his spiritual home.The ceiling has beautiful art to rival that of the Sistene Chapel. A lovely experience.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Very impressive decorated ceiling. Also go down to where his tomb is located. Charming pedestrian streets all around.",
          "Surprised by how light this building was inside - fantastic as it allowed great views of the architecture and the decoration. Also surprised that we were allowed in during Sunday morning Mass, which lovely as it added to the atmosphere of this beautiful building",
          "The basilica was finish in 1197, during the Italo-Norman domination of Apulia, Its foundation is related to the recovery of some of the relics of Saint Nicholas from the saint\u2019s original shrine in Myra, in what is now Turkey. When Myra passed into the hands of the Saracens,",
          "At first entrance to the church nothing seem very special. We have seen many churches throughout Italy. Then we saw a stairway and a sign that said crypt. This was also not unusual. We don't usually visit the crypts as they are often very similar, but we had time and decided to",
          "Absolutely wonderfuland peaceful place! Everything is special there, the atmosphere is asif a miracleis about to happen!",
          "When one has been around the web of narrow streets and alleys of Citta Antica, overhung with washing and overburdened by the havoc of time, one will comprehend that the Church of San Nikola is part of the canvas if it does not also embody it. It personifies the city\u2019s",
          "Such a beautiful place, and kind of random to just pass down tiny streets and find such a huge building in the heart of old town. It\u2019s lovely inside, so quiet despite the Bose sound system along the pillars, haha. Quite lovely, and eerie!",
          "Although often deluged with crowds, it is difficult not to be impressed by the square, castle-like appearance of the Romanesque basilica. The vaulted and beautifully decorated crypt is reputed to be the final resting place of the bones of Saint Nicholas aka Santa Claus.",
          "This Basilica is massive. It is not very colourful, infact it looks quiet bare, but there is something that makes this Basilica look very holy. Then you go to the crypt, and it is completely different, it's very ornate and with a lot of colourful marble. There were a lot of",
          "Very striking church with gorgeous architecture. Typical Norman squareness in the bones, but Byzantine and Romanesque adornments throughout. Make sure you see the crypt with St. Nicholas as well.",
          "A must see in Bari - just set up a credible cover story if visiting with little children \ud83d\ude09. Spectacular interiors and the crypt with the remains of the Saint, and the accompanying icon are very evocative.",
          "Great church with great inside architecture. The interior is spectacular and San Nicola\u2019s tomb was breathtaking... with all the decorations and beautiful paintings.. the ceiling of the church is great to look at.. I visited it by night so it was not crowded. A must visit if you",
          "There is a mystical, holy blessed atmosphere in the St. Nicholas church. With Christmas lights it's even more special. I also recommend everyone to visit the crypt.",
          "Breathtakiingly beautiful! a very sacred place to visit. Thank you Giorgio, Apulia Tours, for making our trip so memorable and all the information you knew on this Basilica.",
          "We've visited Bari especially for Basilica San Nicola. The church absolutely beautiful and peaceful. The most amazing about this place that you feel the unity of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians.",
          "Beautiful Basilica San Nicola. Wonderful architecture. We were longing to visit this beautiful church and its so quiet and peaceful.",
          "This ranks high on our list of beautiful churches, but the crypt is what sets it apart as a stunning place not to be missed. Take your time to observe and appreciate all the details in both the crypt and main basilica.",
          "This church has a surprising interior, well worth a visit. It is shared by Roman Catholics and Russians. What makes it more interesting is that there are plenty of information plaques for you to read all about its history. These are written in Italian, Russian and English. There",
          "The church of San Nicola had a very interesting story. It was a very culturally enriching experience.",
          "Originally built between 1087 and 1197, during the Italo-Norman domination of Apulia, to house the relics of San Nicola, the legendary saint, whose kindness led to the idea of Father Christmas. On the exterior the basilica could be a Norman castle as it was used for in two",
          "Visited the Basilica on a Sunday evening when in town for a meeting. There was an evening mass on, which made it extra special, but both interior and exterior require a visit, especially Dutch/Belgian to visit Sinterklaas!",
          "Hey, where else can you even get close to the remains of Saint Nicholas? A spectacular sight, full of history and legend, not to mention the obvious riches. The ceiling and the crypt are highlights but the surrounding area is full of many more...",
          "While visiting Bari, you will obviously come across this Basilica San Nicola. To my observation not the most architectural or the prettiest of buildings , but you really must enter. Inside, you will see as a beautiful interior. but sadly I, and many others were unable to look",
          "Unusual in that the ground floor is used by Roman Catholics and the crypt by Russian Orthodox . Whilst we were there a Russian naming ceremony was taking place in the crypt, interesting but we felt that we were intruding a bit. Well worth a visit.",
          "Impressive church very beautiful architecture. The inside of the church is simple but with beautiful paintings.",
          "Beautiful church! We were able to join a service in the basement, which was lovely. The church has different parts to explore and is free of entrance.",
          "One of the must see in Bari. Beautiful architecture, almost looks like a castle. The foundation is related to the recovery of some of the relics of St. Nicolas.",
          "Interesting visit. Nice view. A piece of history...we enjoyed the underneath of the church, the museum and all the conservation done...",
          "It is good to see. It is simething else than the ones i saw before. I am not a big fan of this kind of things, but at least now I know how it is inside. Being a key point in Bari, it is worth to check this our.",
          "Sadly we could only stand in awe of this magnificent Basilica a it was closed and we were bitterly disappointed. I cannot understand how this can be so! There were many visitors in the piazza and it was a shame that there was no entry.",
          "Happy I took the time to walk into the old town district of Bari and saw this beautiful ancient building. Nearby in one of the little streets a private resident has set up a beautiful nativity scene in their home. That was a highlight for me. Loved all the cute side streets",
          "Probably the number 1 attraction in Bari. An important place for religion, a great architectural sight and a quiet place to gather your thoughts. It is located in the old city and is not difficult to locate. Inside a beautiful ceiling, some very old wall paintings, a modest and",
          "Wow, beautiful church with fantastic painted ceiling. Free entrance, as a church should be, but donations well worth it. The tomb of St Nicola is pretty busy, but worth seeing. There was a marriage when I arrived, which was great to see also. If you are in Bari it is a MUST!!",
          "This is definitely not what you'd expect from an Italian church, but it is definitely rich in history. The Crypt, on the the other hand, is amazing and you get the see the believers worshiping San Nicola.",
          "The basilica San Nicola illustrates the rich history of Bari, the encounter between differents cultures and architecture styles. It is a must for anyone who is interested in Italian history. The facade is simply marvelous, at the same time, simple and refined",
          "The Basilica San Nicola is beautiful and looks particularly impressive at night, when it is lit up. Definitely worth the walk through.",
          "Old St Nicholas is the patron of this church. He was an early Christian Bishop in Asia Minor, now Turkey, who lived up to his legend today. Patron of single women wishing to marry. Great treat to visit.",
          "Not a believer, but interested in churches. However, this is nothing out of the ordinary, until you go don to the crypt. Very elegant and stylish. A place for reverence if you are a believer. I'm no, but it angers me that people jut want to snap photos. If you come here respect",
          "This church is a place of pilgrimage for many and respects are paid to some of the remains of St Nicholas. They are housed in the crypt and while we visited there was a large number of pilgrims which was fascinating to watch. The basilica itself is well decorated, with a",
          "Beautiful church, but so touristy that it gets irritating (people photographing with flash, groups talking loudly, people wearing hats and getting reprimanded). Also, consider the fact that the bones of St. Nicholas were stolen from Turkey 1,000 years ago. So much for respect.",
          "This church is more famous than the cathedral due to the tomb of St. Nicholas. The age of the building is not obscured by embellishments of the 17th century like many. It is massive and simple, impressive and straight-forward.",
          "This is Santa Claus's forever home! :) St. Nicolas is burried under the church altar. The upper side is catholic church and in the basement orthodox.",
          "Called in here mainly to get out of the heat for a while, some of the architecture is very good, there is also crypt. A few beggars sitting on the steps outside and priests walking straight by them and the first thing you see when you walk in is a room with money all over the",
          "One of the best churches I\u2019ve seen the tomb of Saint Nicole ant the streets near by its located at the old bari",
          "Nice Architecture and Nice story about how and why it was built. No comments about the story about St. Nicolas bones yet it is a nice one",
          "Spent so much time looking up in the Basilica, the ceiling is fantastic. Make sure you visit the crypt also.",
          "This is truly a mystic place, in a very wide square in the heart of Citt\u00e0 Vecchia. Inside is amazing and the crypt is breathless.There, both Catholic and Orthodox services are performed, so you can find people praying in many languages.",
          "The basilica was built between 1087 and 1197 and today is an important pilgrimage destination both Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians from Eastern Europe.",
          "The church is well worth seeing, very beautiful ceiling, Norman arches, remains of the saint in the crypt.",
          "The basilica is dedicated to St. Nicholas, whose relics are kept in the crypt. Crusaders secured the relics in the middle age from the muslims and brought them to Bari. Particularly the ceiling painting and the simple beauty of the church impress the observer. In the crypt you",
          "Very unusual basilica with great history. If you are christian and you are in Bari its the must visit place. Its one of few churches where catholic and orthodox are together.",
          "Basilica San Nicola is a very interesting place to visit, especially for ortodox people. Looks great both outside and inside.",
          "We actually read about it after we visited. It has the remains of St. Nicholas, who inspired the origin of Santa Claus. You should read about the legends and stories of this saint before going inside.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the church. A church is a church. What made this one different is not the church but going downstairs and watch the many Russian pilgrims queuing up to be blessed. This really makes it different from your average church visit. Also the statue of St Nicolas on",
          "In the city of Bari, it\u2019s 28 curch, this Basillica of Nicolaus it\u2019s the most imported off Bari!! Veri Beutiful to visit !",
          "The cathedral of Saint Nicholas is simple but beautiful. It has an upper part, Catholic and the crypt, Orthodox. It was moving to visit at the time of Mass and observe the culture and faith of those attending. St. Nick is here so best not to bring the kids,\ud83e\udd29",
          "Definetly the number 1 attraction here in Bari. An important place for religion, a great architectural sight and a quiet ppace to gather your thoughts and pray. It is located in the old city and it is easy to come by. You can see it over the buildings when you get closer. Inside",
          "The Catholic/Orthodox shared church is interesting, as is the walk through the old town to get there! Very real, and apparently very safe during our day trip",
          "Worth visiting, especially for strongly religious people. There is a shop right to the cathedral where you can buy beautiful presents for friends/family.",
          "Beautiful basilica in old part of town. We were inside and it has so many historical details. I could explore it whole day.",
          "Beautiful location and impressive to visit; not as touristic as I had feared it to be. Especially the crypte is an experience.",
          "A very moving church with done excellent history we went with the family and everyone was touched by it\u2019s beauty the crypt is a must",
          "I stumbled upon this wondering through the alleys of old town area. Neat to see the paintings and architecture of the church. Go into the basement tomb too.",
          "We went here and they were having mass despite all of the tourists in the area. What a beautiful basilica! Loved exploring the surrounding area as well. Bari was very walkable.",
          "You simply have to see the Basilica of St Nicholas if you are in Bari. An impressive building and all the more interesting as Catholic masses are held on the ground floor and Orthodox services take place in the crypt.",
          "There are some local shops as well, you can buy some cute stuff.... Restaurants have usually an amazing food, well priced and don't miss the local wine....",
          "The basilica is one of the best sights in Bari. Be sure to visit the grotto/ crypt beneath the sanctuary!",
          "We were strolling around Bari old town and got to see this bascilica. It\u2019s pretty impressive and the building is really tall. St. Nicolas was buried here. It\u2019s not gaudy as some of tge other churches we had been to in Italy.",
          "An impressive cathedral, dating back to the 10th century, later updated with various styles. Do read up on the stories around St Nicolas before visiting.",
          "Unique because this exquisite church is a meca for Orthodox pilgrims and tourists alike and arguably Bari's No. 1 tourist attraction. But it isn't Bari's cathedral and not the seat of the bishop or centre of the Church in the area. It was built to house the relics of St Nicolas",
          "Amazing place with beautiful architecture. The interior is spectacular and San Nicola\u2019s tomb was breathtaking especially since there was a service in process when we visited. A must visit if you are travelling to Bari.",
          "We stumbled across this cathedral by chance whilst wandering around the old part of the city. Actually we thought we\u2019d already been to this cathedral but it turned out to be for a rival saint! This one is fascinating as it\u2019s both Catholic and Russian Orthodox (for some reason)",
          "This is the basilica of Bari\u2019s patron saint (although there is a rival saint in San Sabino). The most fascinating aspect of this site is that it serves two religious traditions, the Roman Catholic and the Russian Orthodox. Saint Nicholas is revered in both, and a relic (a piece",
          "A very interesting church and less gaudy than I was expecting. The crypt was a bit crowded but I expected that as the remains of Saint Nicholas are there. I would recommend a visit.",
          "The relics of the Saint were brought here by the Normans in 1045? or thereabouts. The massive Cathedral is a practicing Catholic Church. On the lower level a practicing Orthodox Curch exists with many Russian Orthodox Christian Pilgrims coming all year. If your not a religious",
          "Right at the heart of this lovely Italian town. Take time to visit the wonderfully crypt in quiet contemplation.",
          "After three years I am back here. Same place, some peaceful in mind place. Cekling of church is pure spectacular: carved golden wood and religious thema of painting. Underground are the remains of San Nicola, protector of Bari. Sometime religious music are here. Sometime the",
          "The best of this church is the roof with a great work in the carved golden wood. Also in the basement has a russian church with some byzantine icons.",
          "The outside walls are pristine white. You can go into the lower part where the sarcophagus of St Nicola is located and it was packed with devotees so I could only see from a distance . The inside was a pleasant change from the many Baroque churches. Entrance is free.",
          "I went twice because this is a very special place. The tomb in the crypt which has been there since 1087 (the remains of St Nicholas were bought here for safety; he originally died in Turkey in the 4th century) is an amazing, atmospheric place. I also attended High Sung Mass on",
          "What a church, history like this well worth visiting. Best to have a guide take you in so you can appreciate the history of the place. Amazing decorative ceiling panels. Regards David B",
          "I don't visit old churches so much any more. I was glad I walked into this one. It has a very interesting interior with lots to see and admire - art wise.",
          "Finished in 1197, this beautiful church, with its mostly square shape was built of limestone. The interior has a unique architecture and the ceiling is stunning. At almost one thousand years old, it is a must see.",
          "It's located in the city centre so getting there is actually nice walk. One of the main sights, can't miss it if you go walking in the old city.",
          "I highly recommend to visit the San Nicola Basilica on Thursday morning, the saint's relics of Sint Nicolas are open one day a week.",
          "Beautiful place for visiting. I recommend! Do not forget to raise your head and enjoy the beauty of the ceiling painting",
          "I am an Orthodox and getting to \"meet\" Saint Nicholas was very important to me; the crypt is welcoming and inviting to prayer - however, if you are there only for the tourism, you can still have a wonderful experience thanks to the lovely elegant Romanesque architecture and",
          "Not to miss beautiful cathedral built to remember san Nicolas or as we know him, the original Santa Claus. Go downstairs where the oldest part is and the tomb. The old columns are still in great shape.",
          "Great church containing both Catholic and Orthodox parts. Very nice icon of St. Nicholas donated by Serbian king.",
          "Kind of typical medieval church except that this San Nicola is dark skinned. Interesting and enjoyed Mass too.",
          "This is a Catholic church run by Dominican priests, but its most visited section, the crypt with the tomb of Saint Nicholas of Myra (yes, THE Santa Claus!), has many Byzantine Orthodox elements, including a small iconostasis St. Nicholas is one of the most venerated saints in",
          "It doesn\u2019t look much from the outside but the beauty is all held within. The ceiling is stunning. The remains of St Nicholas are here and there is also some wood, believed to be from Jesus\u2019 cross. We aren\u2019t religious but did find the basilica absolutely beautiful. The crypts",
          "We have been to San Nicola on several visits to Bari, and never tire of the atmosphere inside, from the beautiful, simple Norman architecture to the amazing crypt with the tomb of San Nicola. I always marvel at the simple but attractive spacious nature of the nave, supported by",
          "The Basilica of St. Nicholas was built in the 11th and 12th century. The reason for the church was to house the relics of St. Nicholas which were taken from Myra, Turkey when it was invaded by the Saracens. The inside looks basically white washed because it had been redecorated",
          "Sorry if I\u2019m harsh, is just a bit of objectivity. San Nicola and Bari in general are not particularly interesting. Italy is full of amazing cities and town, with fascinating architecture and natural beauty. Bari is simply not one of them and as a consequence (my speculation) is",
          "Interesting church to visit in Bari the ceilings of this Basilica make the place different so worth a visit",
          "What a wonderful experience to celebrate mass on Easter Sunday in this magnificent cathedral. A lovely feel and welcoming congregation. Thank you.",
          "Very close to the sea and very easy to find on Maps, the church is beautiful. We viseted it on Palm Sunday while there was a Georgian (I think) service. I vas very happy to find orthodox candles there, and I took my time to say my prayes. Felt really in peace there.",
          "The Basilica and nearby museum are both well worth a visit. Loved the architecture, the history and the insight into this very old part of Italy.",
          "Very Impressive building. Nice architecture. Very close to sea shore. Many souvenir shops close to it.",
          "We went there while our short stay in Bari. A beautiful place in the middle of the old town. You should visit the crypt",
          "It's beautiful Basilica, i think anyone must go and see it if they pass from there. It's tourist attraction.",
          "St Nicholas was from Turkey but is the patron saint of Bari. He is the protector of the children and unmarried women. The ground level floor is Christian while the lower lever is Orthodox, and this is where you will find his crypt (and his bones).",
          "Square beyond San Nicola, Bari Vecchia, on a narrow peninsula by the port, dates from the medieval times, nice architecture, twisting streets, there are many restaurants, full of caf\u00e9s; it's a large historic center and very visited.",
          "Great cathedral Divided st catolich and ortodoxal areas . Very good chorus. You csm see the St Nocollo grave",
          "This basilica is dedicated to San Nicola, his patron, and in summer times in May, for the Sant Nicolas festival, and becomes the focus of attention for many pilgrims;",
          "A very modest Basilica. It is made of light colored stone. Underneath the altar you have a more interesting area.",
          "I liked his statue, but my beard is way cooler than his. The rest of the Basilica was very interesting especially the lower part which seems to be Orthodox. The structural features of the columns hold an interesting history, I am sure.",
          "Well maintained church with stunning crypt from 1000+ years ago with altar, icons and paintings focussing on St Nicholas. Every surface clear of dust and beautifully polished. Chapel for relics also very impressive.",
          "What a mix of simple and baroque. My first experience of an Orthodox Church in the crypt (closer to hell?) and Catholic above. Totally beautiful place and a great prevalence to experience.",
          "We aren't dealing here with a church as spectacular as, say, the Gothic cathedrals of France or Florence or Siena or Milan, but with an older, sober, dignified Romanesque building with an important history and special meaning for southern Italians and Russians (St Nicholas is a",
          "Perhaps the symbol of Bari, the Church of Saint Nicholas attracts pilgrims from all over the world every year. While I didn't go there in a pilgrimage, I could not skip this church. It's beautiful both from the inside and the outside, with very nice paintings on the ceiling and",
          "Even though the final resting place of St Nicholas may not be as opulent as one may expect, it is the significance of the place that gives it atmosphere. The cathedral is a bit austere with an incredibly contrasting ornate ceiling. In the crypt is the tomb of St.Nicholas, where",
          "This was our second visit but always a must see if visiting Bari. The internal architecture is impressive as is the unique facade of this basilica.",
          "Great to see the resting place of St Nicolas. A wonderful cathedral. Located in a small square an easy walk from the centre of town, the crypt is well worth seeing.",
          "Visit before Christmas. Quiet atmosphere. There is the tomb of Sant Nicolas. Placed in the old town of Bari.",
          "Arriving to San Nicola from the narrow streets of the historical center is always a surprise. With its magnificent facade appears as a giant in the middle of the medieval city. Don't forget to visit the crypt and the bizantine chapel.",
          "I was dreaming about visiting this place for a couple of years. Finally I got there this year. It was more than I was expected. The basilica is well located in the middle of the Old Town. There is an easy access to get inside. It is also easy to go to the tomb of Saint Nicolas.",
          "Nice church. Simply and not so big for the capital of mediteranian Italy. You can see Sf Nicolae tomb",
          "A landmark cathedral for Bari. Of course one must see it but shouldn't be burdened with great expectations. It is pretty ascetic. A little bit of twist comes from the single sculpture of St. Nicolas. Not really interesting.",
          "A translucent ceremony. Auster with constrained baroqueness. Fine granite columnade. No frilly imagery. Spacious. An odd cathedral with reconstituted originality. Access portal wide and open. An exercise in serene religiosity with fine materials mostly elemental.",
          "I never knew the history of Saint Nicolas and coming here and seeing his statue and church was really amazing",
          "It is a historically place very calm and cool. Full of history and safe. We went inside and learnt about the place. It is a church of Roman Catholic. The church was restored in thirteenth century. This place is important for Christians because of Saint Nicholas 4th century",
          "In the middle of Bari old town. Very easy to find and has free entry. The architecture is impressive, particularly the ceiling. Just stunning. And dont forget the down floor. You have to visit the crypt downstairs.",
          "Fabulous day out lots of interesting history busy place can do official tour or take yourself around",
          "Lovely is an understatement. An impressive structure that is imposing on the small square in front of it. The stonework is a joy to behold. The inside is equally captivating. A must see.",
          "Recommend to visit the ancient basilica San Nicola. Beautiful church and you can see the ancient pieces of art ...And leave the letter to San Nicola with your wishes",
          "The only thing I would tell you is that you should not buy a gelato right next to the church, the prices there are incredibly high",
          "Built between 1087 and 1197, this basilica has both western Christian and Byzantine influences. It is so characteristic of the various cultures and influences that crossed southern Italy. In addition to seeing the church itself, stay to participate in a service to better",

          "Beautiful church in Bari, The crypts are amazing. There were people singing when we were there, added to the experience.",
          "Lovely to walk around in the evening. Not sure what the lights are for as they weren't on when we visited in October.",
          "The outside is very plain but the inside is gorgeous travertine stone typical for Puglia. Absolutely beautiful. Many tourist who are respectful of the space and therefore very quiet. Don't miss the crypt below with St. Nicholas' bones. Many pilgrims visit this sacred place.",
          "Impressively large space. White travestine walls. Rather little decoration, but this does not detract from the sense of being in a house of worship. Cool, calm and peaceful",
          "This Basilica is important as it was built during the late 11thC to late 12thC to retain the bones of St Nicholas who is particularly venerated by Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians. The Basilica has been restored several times, the last being in the 20thC when most of the",
          "I can\u2019t say enough about this Basilica! Easy to find and probably the highlight of our time spent in Bari. Be sure to visit the crypt downstairs.",
          "An amazing place demonstrating the potential for religions to assimilate and coexist. The lower floor is for Orthodox worship while the upper floor is for Catholics. An amazing and inspiring building. We were privileged to visit when there was an Orthodox ceremony in progress -",
          "Great place easy to find in the middle of the old town. We visited October and it wasn't very busy. Fantastic architecture. Friendly shop selling St Nicholas oil and gift. Well worth a visit even for non believers!",
          "Simple, but beautiful, ancient church. Saint Nicholas' remains are here. The ceiling is stunning. I would recommend attending a mass here, if possible. The combination of this ancient church and the Italian language are remarkable, and the sound system is modern and excellent.",

        "wiki": "Bari ( BAR-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ba\u02d0ri] (listen); Barese: Bare [\u02c8b\u00e6\u02d0r\u0259]; Latin: Barium; Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, romanized: B\u00e1rion) is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia  region, on the Adriatic Sea, in southern Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples (and the third after Palermo, if Insular Italy is included), a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of 320,257 inhabitants, over 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), while the  urban area has 750,000 inhabitants. The metropolitan area has 1.3 million inhabitants.\nBari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, the Cathedral of San Sabino (1035\u20131171) and the Hohenstaufen Castle built for Frederick II, which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district (the via Sparano and via Argiro).\nModern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s. The city has a redeveloped airport, Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, with connections to several European cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe city was probably founded by the Peucetii. The city had strong Greek influences and once it passed under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were dependent on the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter the devastations of the Gothic Wars, under Longobard rule a set of written regulations was established, the Consuetudines Barenses, which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities. Until the arrival of the Normans, Bari continued to be governed by the Longobards and Byzantines, with only occasional interruption.\nThroughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major slave depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in Slavic slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by Venice from Dalmatia, the Holy Roman Empire from what is now Prussia and Poland, and the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Fatimid Caliphate (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba Mamluks).For 20 years, Bari was the centre of the Emirate of Bari; the city was captured by its first emirs Kalfun in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by Radelchis I of Benevento. The city was conquered and the Emirate extinguished in 871, due to the efforts of Emperor Louis II and a Byzantine fleet. Chris Wickham states Louis spent five years campaigning to reduce then occupy Bari, \"and then only to a Byzantine/Slav naval blockade\"; \"Louis took the credit\" for the success, adding \"at least in Frankish eyes\", then concludes by noting that by remaining in southern Italy long after this success, he \"achieved the near-impossible: an alliance against him of the Beneventans, Salernitans, Neapolitans and Spoletans; later sources include Sawad\u0101n as well.\" In 885, Bari became the residence of the local Byzantine catapan, or governor. The failed revolt (1009\u20131011) of the Lombard nobles Melus of Bari and his brother-in-law Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the Battle of Cannae (1018), offered their Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted \"provincial\" status.\nIn 1071, Bari was captured by Robert Guiscard, following a three-year siege. Maio of Bari (died 1160), a Lombard merchant's son, was the third of the great admirals of Norman Sicily. The Basilica di San Nicola was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from Myra in Lycia, in Byzantine territory. The saint began his development from Saint Nicholas of Myra into Saint Nicholas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the economy of Bari. In 1095 Peter the Hermit preached the first crusade there. In October 1098, Urban II, who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the Council of Bari, one of a series of synods convoked with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the filioque clause in the Creed, which Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the Great Schism was inevitable.\nA civil war broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by Grimoald Alferanites, a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with Byzantium and Venice and taken the title gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to Roger II of Sicily, but rebelled and was defeated in 1132.\nBari was occupied by Manuel I Komnenos between 1155 and 1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nIsabella d\u2019Aragona, princess of Naples and widow of the Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, enlarged the castle, which she made her residence, 1499\u20131524. After the death of Queen Bona Sforza, of Poland, Bari came to be included in the Kingdom of Naples and its history contracted to a local one, as malaria became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist grid plan, which bears his name today as the Murattiano. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of Mussolini can be seen in the imposing architecture along the seafront.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 11 September 1943, in connection with the Armistice of Cassibile, Bari was taken without resistance by the British 1st Airborne Division, then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.\nThe Balkan Air Force supporting the Yugoslav partisans was based at Bari.\n\n\n==== The 1943 chemical warfare disaster ====\n\nThrough a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in World War II, Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience chemical warfare in the course of that war.\nOn the night of 2 December 1943, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacked the port of Bari, which was a key supply centre for Allied forces fighting their way up the Italian Peninsula. Over 20 Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship John Harvey, which was carrying mustard gas; mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport (the chemical agent was intended for retaliation if German forces had initiated chemical warfare.) The presence of the gas was highly classified and the U.S. had not informed the British military authorities in the city of its existence. This increased the number of fatalities, since British physicians\u2014who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas\u2014prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties, many additional casualties were caused among the rescuers, through contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.\nFollowing the attack, the harbor was closed for operations for three weeks and it did not return to full capacity until February 1944.\nA member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid.  Alexander had trained at the Army's Edgewood Arsenal in New Jersey, and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the John Harvey, and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, Mustine.On the orders of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book Disaster at Bari. Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: \"[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen\". Others put the count as high as \"more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians\".Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed \"The Little Pearl Harbor\" after the Japanese air attack on the American naval base in Hawaii, was highly destructive in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, has proved far from easy.\nThe affair is the subject of two books: Disaster at Bari, by Glenn B. Infield, and Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup, by Gerald Reminick.\nIn 1988 through the efforts of Nick T. Spark, U.S. Senators Dennis DeConcini and Bill Bradley, Dr. Stewart Alexander received recognition from the Surgeon General of the United States Army for his actions during the Bari disaster.\n\n\n==== Charles Henderson explosion ====\nThe port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship Charles Henderson exploded in the harbour while offloading 2000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered nonoperational, this time for a month.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBari is the largest urban and metro area on the Adriatic.  It is located in Southern Italy, at a more northerly latitude than Naples, further south than Rome.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBari has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nShown above are the nine governmental community boards (Municipalities) of Bari: these are further divided into twenty neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\n\nTeatro Margherita.\nTeatro Piccinni.\nOrto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bari, a botanical garden.\nSanta Chiara, once church of the Teutonic Knights (as Santa maria degli Alemanni) and now houses a museum. It was restored in 1539.\nThe Acquedotto Pugliese\nThe medieval church of San Marco dei Veneziani, with a rose window in the fa\u00e7ade.\nConservatory of Bari\nSan Giorgio degli Armeni.\nSanta Teresa dei Maschi, the main Baroque church in the city (1690\u20131696).\nPane e Pomodoro Beach is the main beach within reach of the city. Its reputation has for several years suffered from the apparent presence of asbestos from nearby industrial plants.\nBari features two sea harbours: the Old Port and the New Port, constructed in 1850.\n\n\n==== Basilica of Saint Nicholas ====\n\nThe Basilica di San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from Myra in Lycia, and now lie beneath the altar in the crypt, where are buried the Topins, which are a legacy of old thieves converted to good faith. The church is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia (the others being the cathedrals of Acquaviva delle Fonti and Altamura, and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano).\n\n\n==== Bari Cathedral ====\nBari Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Sabinus of Canosa (San Sabino), was begun in Byzantine style in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170 and 1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the transept.\nAn example of Apulian Romanesque architecture, the church has a simple Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The crypt houses the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.\nThe interior and the fa\u00e7ade were redecorated in Baroque style during the 18th century, but these additions were removed in a 1950s restoration.\n\n\n==== Petruzzelli Theatre ====\nThe Petruzzelli Theatre, founded in 1903, hosted different forms of live entertainment, or nineteenth century \u201cPoliteama\u201d.  The theatre was all but destroyed in a fire on October 27, 1991. It was reopened in October 2009, after 18 years.\n\n\n==== Swabian Castle ====\n\nThe Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the Castello Svevo (Swabian Castle), was built by Roger II of Sicily around 1131. Destroyed in 1156, it was rebuilt by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.\n\n\n==== Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari ====\nThe Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari (Provincial Picture Gallery of Bari) is the most important art gallery in Apulia. It was first established in 1928 and contains many paintings from the 15th century up to the days of contemporary art.\n\n\n==== The Russian Church ====\nThe Russian Church of Saint Nicholas, in the Carrassi district of Bari, was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nicholas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.\nThe city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a trade-off with the Putin government in Moscow, exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a military barracks near Bari's central railway station.\n\n\n==== Barivecchia ====\nBarivecchia, or Old Bari, is a sprawl of streets and passageways making up the section of the city to the north of the modern Murat area. Barivecchia was until fairly recently considered a no-go area by many of Bari's residents due to the high levels of petty crime. A large-scale redevelopment plan began with a new sewerage system, followed by the development of the two main squares, Piazza Mercantile and Piazza Ferrarese.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 2015, there were 326,344 people residing in Bari (about 1.6 million live in the greater Bari area), located in the province of Bari, Puglia, of whom 47.9% were male and 52.1% were female. As of 2007, minors (children ages 18 and younger) totaled 17.90 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.08 percent.

People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy.  Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes.

The recipe commonly consists of penne or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with mozzarella or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.\nFresh fish and seafood are often eaten raw. Octopus, sea urchins and mussels feature heavily. Perhaps Bari's most famous dish is the oven-baked patate, riso e cozze (potatoes with rice and mussels).\nBari and the whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including Primitivo, Castel del Monte, and Muscat, notably Moscato di Trani.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe dialect of Bari belongs to the upper-southern Italo-Romance  family, and currently coexists with Italian; generally these are used in different contexts.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nLocal football club S.S.C.

The stadium also hosted the 1991 European Cup Final.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBari has its own airport, Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, which is located 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of the centre of Bari. It is connected to the centre by train services from Bari Aeroporto railway station.\nBari Central Station lies on the Adriatic railway and has connection to cities such as Rome, Milan, Bologna, Turin and Venice. Another mainline is connection southwards by the Bari-Taranto railway. Regional services also operate to Foggia, Barletta, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto and other towns and villages in the Apulia region.\nBari has an old fishery port (Porto Vecchio) and a so-called new port in the north, as well as some marinas. The Port of Bari is an important cargo transport hub to S.E.Europe. Various passenger transport lines include some seasonal ferry lines to Albania, Montenegro or Dubrovnik. Bari-Igoumenitsa is a popular ferry line to Greece, some cruise ships anchor in Bari too.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bari, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 minutes. 11% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day.

          "Beatiful castle well preserved, with still the ancient moat that surrounds it ( devoid of water ). The citizen of Bari call it \" U Castidde\", this castle is named in the writings of Horace and Tacitus, so we are talking about 1900 years ago. What we see today is datet back in",
          "Substandard and overpriced - empty rooms void of... Well, anything. It's not worth the entrance ticket, you'll be done in less than 15 min only to walk out with nothing more than a 'meh' feeling. Disappointing given the rich Archaeological findings in the area of Apullia",
          "I like castles but this one is really just a museum. You can visit a few of the rooms, for a fee, but the walls etc. are off limits for safety reasons.",
          "Before leaving Bari after our 2-night stay, we wanted to visit the impressive looking castle near the waterfront, having read about the great views from the castle walls, etc. Well, what a disappointment! We paid the (exorbitant) entry fee of \u20ac12 each to walk around its mostly",
          "You think you visit a castle. But it is more an empty (half empty) museum. The art shown was not my thing. Some exhibition rooms were empty. When i visit a castle, i want to see the castle, the views and historical pieces. Many stairs areas were closed. This was disappointing,",
          "This place is amazingly well preserved but the exterior is far better preserved and more impressive than the interior.",
          "At the heart of this historic castle was a wonderful exhibition of work influenced by Leonard da Vince and one of the people who lived in the castle hundreds of years ago. Although this wasn\u2019t the most exciting Italian castle I\u2019ve been into, it was still an enjoyable and",
          "Well worth the entry fee. make sure you watch the video first before exploring. the intricate carving are centuries old",

          "The Castello Svevo of Bari is an amazing fortress , in the old town very near to the Cathedral facing the port. One of the best and well preserved monuments of the city , serves now also as a museum. It has a peculiar shape with a central court yard and 3 towers, tall enough to",
          "Decided that this was worth a look. Entry is free unless you want a guided tour. On the day of our visit, a local girls' school was doing a project to improve their English and were taking turns to guide us around the castle and the exhibits. Excellent work from the girls",
          "The castle is well renovated and care has been spent. We arrived to find free exhibits and entry so had a good look around. A great exhibition on Father Christmas around world Nd suitable for all ages with good interactive stuff. Sculpture and art also good.",
          "Small castle being refurbished. Limited displays. Nothing exceptional but worth popping your head in you\u2019re in the area. Our trip was massively enhanced by a school project with school kids practising English while telling us about the exhibits.",

          "We stayed very close to this castle, and this Castle is amazing. It is set in a superb position, and can't be missed. We walked all around the place, and enjoyed every minute. We meant to go inside the castle, but we never found the time. We have to visit beautiful Bari",
          "The architecture is very striking: it looks like virtually every castle in Normandy or Norman times in England, huge, square, squat. It has a very interesting series of rooms with Byzantine and Romanesque touches, as well as some Swabian lineaments. There is little to see in",
          "At first glance, you see a huge fort/castle and think to yourself \"there must be a lot to explore and see inside\". In reality, you can literally see all of the few tiny spaces they have open and watch a movie about it in 15 minutes or less. I felt ripped off by the almost $25",
          "There is really nothing to see. You can't go almost anywhere and the price. There is no garden. We were very upset after our visit",

          "Even if one doesn't know the history of this gorgeous fortification it speaks for itself in terms of importance. A photographer's delight!",

          "The castle is far larger than it looks! As you venture inside, you soon get an idea of the size and splendour that once adorned this massive structure. For only 3.00 euros it was well worth the money as you can spend a few hours touring this structure. While not the most",

          "The castle is surrounded by a moat on all sides, except the northern section, which was bordering the sea and can be accessed from the bridge and the gate on the southern side. It is mainly composed of the Aragon walls and the main Swabian tower, and is currently used for",
          "There was not much to see inside, when I went the first floor was being renovated so it was only the museum part and the excavation. The castle on the outside is very beautiful so it makes it worth the visit; so if your are around I would recommend it. The entrance is not",
          "One of the most attractive things in Bari. This castle was built by Sicilian king Roger II in 1132. Look at this extraordinary architecture style.",

          "Not far from the main square lies this ancient castle, recently refurbished to a very high standard. Built by Frederick the second, renowned for his two friendly crusades to Jerusalem, and builder of several other castles in Puglia. Unfortunately most of the written",
          "The castle could be much nicer if entirely open. Only one floor is visitable, the rest is under restoration but there was nobody working on it. I spent in total 20min in there, counting the bookshop. In my opinion the walls could be the nicest part if they were open, maybe with",
          "This castle has an exposition inside of artifacts from back in the era of national wars with other cities. It is also a place for you to check out local architecture, not only from the walls on the outside to protect from sieges, but also pillars fancily ornamented",
          "Unfortunately, most of the castle was closed and it took us about 20-25 minutes walking through it. This included watching about 10 minutes of the most boring history documentary of this castle. No, Bari got this all wrong and needs to go back to the drawing board. When it is",

          "We got lucky and visited freee 1st Sunday of the month or we might have missed this gem. The exhibition has moulds of hundreds of sculpures form the region and enabled you to see the detail up close We saw many of the sculptures later in the holiday in Trani, Lecce etc and it",

          "This castle has a lot to offer even though I could not visit the actual living quarters of the last royal family who lived there, called Pappacoda due to renovations. There are multi layers of excavations, from old chapels from the time of St. Francis to the old round basements",
          "Off season and a lot of the castle was off limits.....entire second floor actually. Disappointing but still a nice visit and glad we stopped",
          "Very good film shown in English about the archeological digs on site, and the castle's renovations. Also a good photo display of the same, but most of the castle itself is locked away behind closed doors, so definately not worth the admission price! They had 2 rooms of",
          "I didn't enter inside it, but I loved how the walls were reflecting the yellow light in the night. It's a true pleasure to stay in the walls of the castel when the night is falling done and see how the city came up to life after a hot day. Also the combination of road, water and",

          "The castle is under reconstruction, so inside you can visit only a few rooms and halls - the most interesting is the one with photos and models of what the castle looked like in the past, how dilapidated it was and how much has been done so far to restore it. Other interesting",
          "From the outside this looks impressive. The Castle is undergoing some renovation and we couldn't visit much of it. There was though an impressive collection of artifacts and some information about the history of the place. Unfortunately most of the information was written in",

        "wiki": "Elizabeth of Poland (Hungarian: Erzs\u00e9bet, Polish: El\u017cbieta; 1305 \u2013 29 December 1380) was queen of Hungary by marriage to Charles I of Hungary, and regent of Poland from 1370 to 1376 during the reign of her son Louis I.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nShe was a member of the Polish royal House of Piast, the daughter of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high, prince of Kujavia, later King of Poland, and Jadwiga of Greater Poland. She was the sister of Casimir III of Poland, who died in 1370. Her older sister was Cunigunde of Poland, who was married to Bernard of \u015awidnica.\n\n\n=== Queen consort ===\n\nShe was married on 6 July 1320 to Charles I Robert, King of Hungary. Elizabeth was Charles' fourth wife. The marriage brought an alliance between Poland and Hungary.\nCharles' two previous marriages are believed not to have left surviving issue, at least no surviving sons. Charles' first wife Maria of Bytom was believed to have been barren but it is also believed she bore two daughters: Catherine and Elizabeth. Others however believe that the two girls were daughters of Queen Elizabeth.\nWhile at court in Hungary, Elizabeth is credited as having been the first to introduce perfume, then known as Hungary Water, to Europe and the western world.\n\n\n=== Queen mother ===\nFollowing her husband Charles Robert's death, Elizabeth wished to make a good marriage for her eldest surviving son, Louis. She had her son betrothed to Margaret of Bohemia, daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. They married in 1342 but the marriage didn't last because, seven years into the marriage, the fourteen-year-old Margaret died, childless. Elizabeth now needed for her son to remarry and produce an heir.\nThe branch of the Kuyavian Piast family was popular in Hungary, and several members lived in Louis' court. Elizabeth's influence extended far beyond any other queen consort, and years before, Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, married Elizabeth of Kuyavia, the daughter of the Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo, Queen Elizabeth's cousin. Stephen II of Bosnia had a young daughter named Elizabeth, and after learning about her, the Hungarian queen insisted immediately on bringing her to the Hungarian court for fostering. Stephen was reluctant at first, but eventually dispatched Elizabeth. Three years later, Queen Elizabeth invited Stephen to Hungary and arranged a marriage between their children.\nThe queen mother was heir to her brother Casimir's throne after the death of their sister, Cunigunde. Her claim passed to Louis after the death of his two elder brothers. Casimir had married four times but none of his wives had given him surviving sons. He chose to leave Louis the crown of Poland thus Hungary and Poland being united under one monarch.\nElizabeth's second surviving son, Andrew, married Joan I of Naples. Andrew wished to be made king of Naples and rule jointly with his wife, but Joan refused. Pope Clement VI approved Joan's request to be crowned alone. Fearing for his life, Andrew wrote to his mother that he would soon flee the kingdom. She intervened and made a state visit; before she returned to Hungary, she bribed the Pope to reverse himself and permit Andrew's coronation. She also gave her son a ring, which was supposed to protect him from death by blade or poison, and returned with a false sense of security to Hungary. The ring didn't protect him; Andrew was soon assassinated by strangulation.\n\n\n=== Regent ===\nLouis was absent from Poland between 1370-1375. Elizabeth was made regent to conveniently eliminate her from his court. The Poles hated paying taxes and loved to quarrel among themselves and with the court, especially with the domineering Elizabeth. Her regency turned out to be a failure, her own Polish background notwithstanding. In 1376, the Poles killed 160 of her Hungarian bodyguards and Elizabeth escaped to Hungary lest she, too, be killed by her compatriots. Louis reconciled with the rebels, and strengthened his power, at his mother's expense.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nAfter her regency and her return to Hungary, Elizabeth spent her final years in a monastery outside of Buda, where she wrote her will. It specifies her desire to rest in the monastery of Order of Saint Clare in Old Buda. Elizabeth also left money and possessions to her family: she left Louis several golden vessels, daughter-in-law, Elizabeth of Bosnia - Buda Castle, granddaughter, Mary - a gold wreath, granddaughter, Jadwiga - wreath of lilies, and her niece, Hedwig - a ring. She also left money to some churches.\n\n\n== Issue ==\nCharles (1321)\nLadislaus (Belgrade, 1 November 1324 \u2013 24 February 1329)\nLouis I of Hungary (1326\u20131382)\nAndrew, Duke of Calabria (1327\u20131345)\nStephen, Duke of Slavonia (1332\u20131354)\nCatherine (d. 1355)\nElizabeth (d.1367), married Boleslaw Opolski, sister of Katherine and also possible daughter of Elisabeth of Poland.\n\n\n== Ancestors ==\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe Queen was a renowned patron of arts and founder of many shrines which she fitted with wonderful treasures. The exquisite examples of Queen's foundation includes silver Reliquary Shrine with Virgin and Child from about 1350 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed to Jean de Touyl, most probably created for the convent of the Poor Clares of the Order of Saint Francis at Buda, also founded by the Queen in 1334 and silver reliquary of Saint Nicholas in the form of a gothic church from 1344, attributed to Pietro di Simone Gallico in the Museo Nicolaiano in Bari. Elizabeth also inspired the fundation of the Hungarian Chapel in Aachen and sponsored some of its treasures.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nQueen Elizabeth is one of the supporting characters in Polish historical drama TV series \"Korona kr\u00f3l\u00f3w\" (The Crown of the Kings\"). She is played by Katarzyna Czapla.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHungary Water\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDvornik, Francis (1962). The Slavs in European History and Civilization.

        "wiki": "Earth First! is a radical environmental advocacy group that emerged in the Southwestern United States in 1979. It was founded on April 4, 1980, by Dave Foreman, Mike Roselle, Howie Wolke, Bart Koehler, and Ron Kezar.Today there are Earth First! groups in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Inspired by several environmental writings, including Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Aldo Leopold's land ethic, and Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang, a small group of environmental activists composed of Dave Foreman, ex-Yippie Mike Roselle, Wyoming Wilderness Society representatives Bart Koehler and Howie Wolke, and Bureau of Land Management employee Ron Kezar, united to form Earth First!. While traveling in Foreman's VW bus from the El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in northern Mexico to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the group pledged, \"No compromise in defense of Mother Earth!\".\nThe co-founders of the group were called to action during the second \"Roadless Area Review and Evaluation\" (RARE II) by the U.S. Forest Service, which they considered a sell-out by mainstream environmental advocates. The activists envisioned a revolutionary movement, with the goal to set aside multi-million-acre ecological preserves all across the United States. Their ideas drew upon the concepts of conservation biology, which had been developing for over twenty years by notable scientists like E. O. Wilson; however, mainstream environmental groups were slow to embrace the new science. These events and ideologies coalesced after a grueling hike, as the men were headed toward Albuquerque. After \"Foreman called out 'Earth First!', Roselle drew a clenched fist logo, passed it up to the front of the van, and there was Earth First!\"\n\n\n== Early years ==\nDuring the group's early years (1979\u20131986), Earth First! mixed publicity stunts (such as rolling a plastic \"crack\" down Glen Canyon Dam) with far-reaching wilderness proposals that reportedly surpassed the actions that mainstream environmental groups were willing to take (relying on conservation biology research from a biocentric perspective). The group's proposals were published in a periodical, Earth First! The Radical Environmental Journal, informally known as the Earth First! Journal. Edward Abbey often spoke at early gatherings, and his inspirational writings led him to be revered by the early movement. An annual gathering of the group was known as the Round River Rendezvous, with the name taken from an Ojibwa myth about a continuous river of life flowing into and out of itself and sustaining all relations. The rendezvous is a celebration with art and music, as well as an activist conference with workshops and recounts of past actions. Another project led by the organization at this time was the creation of Earth First! Foundation, a tax-deductible fund which was established to provide financial support for research, advocacy and education by Earth First! activists. The fund was later renamed the Fund for Wild Nature in 1991.In the spring of 1985, a nationwide call to action against the logging company Willamette Industries, published in the Earth First! Journal brought Earth First! members from around the United States to the Willamette National Forest of Western Oregon. After finding road blockades (carried out by Corvallis-based Cathedral Forest Action Group) were not an efficient form of protection against logging, Marylander Ron Huber and Washingtonian Mike Jakubal devised tree sitting as a more effective civil disobedience alternative.On May 23, 1985, Mike Jakubal led the first Earth First! tree sit.  When U.S. Forest Service law enforcement official Steve Slagowski arrived, Mike Roselle, Ron Huber, and others were arrested for sitting at the base of the tree in support. The first \"tree-sitting\" lasted less than a day\u2014Jakubal came down in the evening to look over the remains of the forest that had been cut down around him, and was arrested by a hidden Forest Service officer\u2014but the tree-sitting concept was deemed sound by Earth First! members. Huber, Jakubal, and Roselle demonstrated the concept at the June 14 Washington EF Rendezvous; on June 23, a convoy of activists arrived at Willamette National Forest and set up tree platforms in \"Squaw/Three timbersale\", a location the group thought was threatened with imminent destruction. While at one point, up to a dozen trees were occupied, on July 10 a clash took down all the trees with platforms except for Ron Huber's after the other sitters had left for an overnight meeting elsewhere. Huber remained at his tree, dubbed Yggdrasil, until July 20 when two Linn County sheriff's deputies were lifted in a crane box and wrestled him from the tree.\nAfter 1987, Earth First! became primarily associated with direct action to prevent logging, building of dams, and other forms of development which may cause destruction of wildlife habitats or the despoliation of wild places. The change in direction attracted many new members to Earth First!, some of whom came from a leftist or anarchist political background or were involved in the counterculture.  Dave Foreman has suggested that this led to the introduction of activities such as a \"puke-in\" at a shopping mall, a flag burning, the heckling of Edward Abbey at the 1987 Earth First! rendezvous, and back-and-forth debates in the Earth First! Journal on topics such as anarchism, with which Foreman and other Earth First! members did not wish to be associated.  Most of the group's older members, including Dave Foreman, Howie Wolke, Bart Koehler, Christopher Manes, George Wuerthner, and Earth First! Journal editor John Davis, became increasingly uncomfortable with this new direction. This tension reportedly led several of the founders to sever their ties to Earth First! in 1990.  Many of them went on to launch the magazine, Wild Earth, as well as the environmental group, the Wildlands Project. On the other hand, Roselle, along with activists such as Judi Bari, welcomed the new direct-action tactics and leftist direction of Earth First!.\nStarting in the mid-1980s, Earth First! increasingly promoted and identified with \"deep ecology\", a philosophy put forth by Arne N\u00e6ss, Bill Devall, and George Sessions, which holds that all forms of life on Earth have equal value in and of themselves, without regard for their utility to human beings.\n\n\n== Since 1990 ==\nSince 1990, action within the Earth First! movement has become increasingly influenced by anarchist political philosophy. This change brought a rotation of the primary media organ in differing regions,, an aversion to organized leadership or administrative structure, and a new trend of identifying Earth First! as a mainstream movement rather than an organization. In 1992, Earth First!'s push toward the mainstream movement led to the creation of an offshoot group called Earth Liberation Front. The Earth Liberation Front was formally introduced during the 1992 Earth First! Round River Rendezvous, where young activists debated the effectiveness of civil disobedience activism tactics in light of the ever-increasing destruction of the planet by human activity. Elders of the Earth First! movement gave their blessing to this newly formed strike team known as ELF. ELF became the extremists of the environmental movement, just as the Earth First! movement itself had been when it was created a decade earlier.\nEarth First! protests commonly involved occupations of forested timber sale areas and other threatened natural areas. In these protests, dozens of people physically locked their bodies to trees, bulldozers, and desks using specially created lock boxes (metal tubes reinforced with rebar) through which protesters threaded their arms, or using bicycle U-locks in order to lock their necks to other objects. In 1997, as part of the ongoing HeadWaters Redwoods protests, activists locked themselves to a redwood stump which was carried into California Congressman Frank Riggs' office.The HeadWaters campaign in Northern California aims to protect the last old-growth redwood forests from logging by the Pacific Lumber Company. The Pacific Lumber Co. was bought out by Maxxim, a hedge fund company that planned to liquidate its assets including these old-growth forests. HeadWaters has been an ongoing protest lasting over 15 years.In 1990, environmental activists Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were injured when a pipe-bomb exploded in the car Bari was driving. The FBI arrested Bari and her friends and accused them of planting the bombs. other theories suggest FBI involvement but it remains an open case. A civil case was later brought against the FBI and local police which found Bari's and Cherney's civil rights had been violated.The largest timber sale in U.S. Forest Service history, the Cove/Mallard Timber Sale, occurred in Idaho from 1992 to 1998. With the aid of a nearby landowner, a former land developer turned activist, Earth First! occupied the forest. As a result, Earth First! succeeded in saving most of the threatened wilderness area. Over 350 people from 12 countries were arrested and the project was reduced from its initial plan of 200 clear-cuts and the construction of seven new roads, to 37 clear-cuts and two new roads.\nIn June 1993, Earth First! halted the construction of the Noble Road by erecting elaborate multi-layered barricades, which included U.S. Forest Service vehicles. These barricades were constructed in one night, during which activists traveled 17 miles through the mountains dodging law enforcement patrols who had been informed of the planned demonstration. The first tripod lockdowns occurred at this incident, which involved three 30 foot logs, tied together and placed upright, with an activist tied to a platform between them 20 feet in the air. The tripod was placed over trenches in which four activists were buried in quick-drying cement. Two additional activists used U-locks to lock their necks to the front axles of responding vehicles. U.S. Forest Service shot at activists and raided the land with a SWAT team armed with M-16s. 27 activists were arrested.\nDuring Free Cascadia, a mass occupation organized by Earth First! at the Warner Creek timber sale in Oregon, 50-plus activists continuously occupied the burnt forested mountains of Oregon for a year in 1994-1995. They endured bad weather and law enforcement raids. Their barricades which were dug in reinforced trenches, forts with watchtowers, and tree-sits enabled a constant occupation of the land while lawsuits and political actions locally and in Washington D.C., ultimately saved the land.  Warner Creek is often seen an example of how the Earth First movement was successful, though most Earth First occupations of timber sales, failed.\nIn the summer of 1995, environmental activists attempted to occupy the old-growth timber sale area of Sugarloaf Mountain in Southern Oregon.  The Sugarloaf Mountain had been in legal battles for over a decade when the \"Rider from Hell\" was added in committee to the congressional Crime Bill of 1994, which mandated the logging of thousands of acres of old-growth forest.  The United States Forest Service declared an exclusionary zone of 30 square miles in southern Oregon and arrested anyone in the area including a local woman walking her dog. Over 100 federal agents, supported by helicopters and the elite US Army Ranger-trained law enforcement squad known as \"Camo-Feddies,\" arrested hundreds of activists. The environmental activists engaged at all levels of protest with numerous public and illegal demonstrations by Earth First, protests at government offices locally and in Washington D.C., tree-sits in active logging zones, and even an attempted helicopter pad lock-down to immobilise logging helicopters.  One tree from Sugarloaf timber sale, which was a four day long tree-sit by a local father and son Earth First team, required 9 log trucks to carry it out in sections. This tree was estimated to be over 400 years old and took twenty-seven minutes to cut down using a 7-foot chainsaw.\nEarth First! responded by immediately occupying the nearby timber sale known as China Left in early October 1995 to defend the old-growth forest and the last wild salmon spawning grounds in Oregon. EF activists used dragon lock-boxes on both ends of the valley's only road to protect the area. A female Earth First! activist known as \"Ocean\" held the road for a day as police attempted to remove this human-and-cement blockade, allowing Earth First! to dig in farther down the valley. This was the start of two-year-long occupation protest, during which a pickup truck was turned into a lock box to block the only bridge to the valley.Earth First! protesters were often tortured by police, who used pepper spray, pain compliance holds, police dogs, and the threat with guns in attempts to coerce the protesters to abandon their lock downs.The Earth First! movement has been labelled as a terrorist organization by its opponents. Supporters of the movement disagree, explaining that their cause is one of civil disobedience and honor for the Earth.The Earth First! movement engages targets of environmental destruction with civil disobedience actions designed to draw attention and to slow down destruction of threatened wilderness areas, using lock-down techniques to create living blockades.The first acknowledged death of an Earth First! activist occurred on September 18, 1998, in northern California's Redwood forests. Earth First! activist David Chain attempted to protect the forest by moving around inside the active logging site, thereby creating unsafe conditions for timber harvest. Normally, this would have resulted in the interruption of logging, but a large Redwood, thought to be over 300 years old, was cut down by a Pacific Lumber logger and fell upon Chain, who died instantly.'Avalon, a member of the Earth Liberation Front, died on the night of Winter Solace 2005 in a prison cell, while in FBI custody, when he was being held for terrorism charges from multiple arson incidents over the last decade, including the Vail Ski resort fire. The rest of his ELF group was also arrested and are currently serving life sentences in federal prison for crimes that involved property damage.  'Avalon was a long term Earth First activist, one of the occupation activists of Warner Creek Oregon and the Cove/Mallard Idaho protests for years and one of 4 who constantly camped out in snow-caves monitoring the only logging of Noble Road in the winter of January to March 1995 in 12-foot deep snow and sub-zero temps.  After witnessing the destruction of \"America's Amazon Jungle\" where for hundreds of miles around was wild untouched mountainous forests, 'Avalon became disenchanted with mere civil disobedience and developed a more radical point of view. :Most activists of Earth First! have previously participated in more moderate forms of environmental and political activism, including protest marches and writing letters to politicians. The Earth First! activist called 'Llama, of the Great Lakes Earth First! chapter in Chicago, had been involved in college activism for years. He traveled to D.C. and other capitols to lobby government officials, and even received a letter from President Clinton thanking him for his \"efforts to save the wild lands of America.\"  'Fawn, another Earth First!er, grew up as a Republican in a middle-class family.Most members of Earth First! identify as decentralized, locally informed activists whose ideas stem from communitarian ethics. One of the early critics of Earth First!'s change in tactics later accused the FBI of deliberately introducing the concept of Non-Violence to the group.In various parts of the country, individual citizens and small groups form the base for grassroots political actions. These may take the form of legal actions, including protests, timber sale appeals, and educational campaigns or civil disobedience, including tree sitting, road blockades, and sabotage (also called \"ecotage\" by some Earth First! members, who claim it is a form of ecodefense). Often, disruptive direct action is used primarily as a stalling tactic in an attempt to prevent possible environmental destruction while Earth First! lawsuits try to secure long-term victories. Reported tactics include road blockades, activists locking themselves to heavy equipment, tree-sitting, and sabotage of machinery.Earth First! was known for providing information in the Earth First! Journal on the practice of tree-spiking and monkeywrenching (or ecotage), which have led to reports of injuries from such tactics, although there is no evidence that Earth First! was involved in related activity. In 1990, Judi Bari convinced Earth First! in the Northern California and Southern Oregon region to renounce these practices, calling them counterproductive to an effort to form a coalition with workers and small logging businesses to defeat large-scale corporate logging in Northern California.\n\n\n=== Judi Bari car bombing ===\nIn 1990, a bomb exploded in Judi Bari's car, shattering her pelvis and also injuring fellow activist Darryl Cherney. Bari and Cherney were later arrested after police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected that they had been transporting the bomb when it accidentally exploded. Bari contended that extremists opposed to her pro-environmental actions had placed the bomb in her car in order to kill her. The case against them was eventually dropped due to lack of evidence. Bari died in 1997 of cancer, but her federal lawsuit against the FBI and Oakland, California police resulted in a 2002 jury verdict awarding her estate and Darryl Cherney a total of $4.4 million. Eighty percent of the damages were for violation of their First Amendment rights by the FBI and police, who tried to discredit them in the media as violent extremists despite ample evidence to the contrary. The bombing remains unsolved.A documentary movie about the court case, entitled The Forest for the Trees, was released in 2006. It was directed by Bernadine Mellis, whose father is one of the lawyers featured in the documentary.\nThe documentary Who Bombed Judi Bari?, directed by Mary Liz Thomson, was released in 2012. The filmmakers are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading the arrest of the bomber.On March 21, 2011, a U.S. federal judge in California ordered the FBI to preserve evidence related to the car bombing. The FBI was planning to destroy all evidence in the case.\n\n\n== In the United Kingdom ==\n\nThe Earth First! movement in the United Kingdom started in 1990, when a group in Hastings, Sussex organised an action at Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent. It grew rapidly, and many groups formed, with or without the EF! name, over the next years.\nThe first major Earth First! actions happened in 1992 and focused around the importation of tropical hardwood. The first major action had happened in December 1991 at Port of Tilbury. The second major action, the Merseyside Dock Action, attracted between 200\u2013600 people who occupied Liverpool docks for two days.  This action coincided with the Earth First! roadshow, in which a group of UK & US Earth First!ers toured the country. Other early campaigns also focused on timber-yards, most notably the Timbmet yard in Oxford.There are now various regional Earth First! groups, the EF! Action Update has been joined by the EF! Action Reports website and a yearly Earth First! national gathering. At the first gathering in Sussex the debate focused on the use of criminal damage as a protest technique. Earth First! decided to neither 'condemn nor condone' criminal damage, instead it focused more on non-violent direct action techniques. Some people at the gathering coined the term Earth Liberation Front (ELF), which became a separate movement which spread back to the US. Actions involving criminal damage did happen often under cover of night and were typically done under an ELF banner and attributed to elves and pixies, or the Earth Liberation Faeries, giving a distinctly British feel to the movement.\nMajor growth in the direct action movement started with a concurrent focus on roads, and a protest camp at Twyford Down was started, against the M3 in Hampshire. Whilst Earth First! groups still played an essential part, other groups such as the Dongas tribe soon formed. Alongside SchNEWS, such publications as the Earth First! Action Update, and Do or Die were means of communication between the groups. The movement grew to other road protest camps including the Newbury bypass, the A30 and the M11 link road protest in London, where whole streets were squatted in order to slow down the construction work.  Later the focus widened to other campaigns including Reclaim the Streets, anti-genetics campaigns, and Rising Tide. More recently, there have been groups such as Peat Alert! and Plane Stupid.The UK Earth First! groups differed considerably from the U.S. groups as reported in a ten-year retrospective of the Earth First! by two of the founders Jake Bowers and Jason Torrance:\n\nWe knew EF! US's original hardline \"rednecks for wilderness\" attitude wouldn't appeal here, so we set out to build a group that combined radical action and social justice to protect Britain's few remaining natural places.\nSeeing ecological and social justice as one and the same, in addition to organizing along anarchist lines and bringing in other radical and militant struggles, mixed with audacious actions and real radicalism spread the EF! ideal to other countries and helped morph the US movement.\n\n\n== Sabotage ==\n\n\n=== Telluride Ski Resort ===\nOn August 10, 1991, vandals identifying themselves as members of Earth First! forced the closing of the Telluride Ski Resort in Mountain Village, Colorado using a chemical to write messages on 11 greens, such as \"Earth First!\", \"Hayduke lives\" and \"Ron you pig\". In relation to the incident, the Telluride Times Journal received a letter signed \"Earth First\" stating that the ski lift had been sabotaged with a welding gas applied to the lift cable that weakens the metal.\n\n\n=== Fairfield Snowbowl Ski Resort ===\nEarth First! member Mark Davis was sentenced in Federal court to six years in prison for malicious destruction of property at the Fairfield Snowbowl Ski Resort near Flagstaff, Arizona, in concert with David Foreman, Ilse Asplund, Margaret Millett, and Mark Baker. Davis had been charged with \"using a torch to cut around the base of the top pylon of the main chair lift at Snowbowl on October 25, 1988.\"The resort attack, sabotage at Energy Fuels' Canyon uranium mine (6 miles southeast of Tusayan, Arizona), and attempting to cut down power-line towers leading to the Central Arizona Project aqueduct, were characterized as dress rehearsals for attacks on nuclear plants.\n\n\n== Documentaries ==\nPickaxe, based on the 1990s Earth First!-led \"Cascadia Free State\"\nIn 2009 EF!, along with the ELF, were the subject of a documentary called Green With A Vengeance.\nA 2011 documentary on the ELF and EF!, entitled, If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front.\nTestify! - Eco-Defense and the Politics of Violence\n\n\n== See also ==\nConservation ethic\nExtinction Rebellion\nGreen anarchism\nGreen syndicalism\nHayduke\nList of environmental organizations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Books about the early Earth First! ===\nDavis, John, ed.

          "Beautiful and unique site - an interesting mix of water, rock, caves and man-made stuff. Visited in January when nobody was there but I understood it's very crowded in the summer.",
          "This is magic to the eyes and water is so clear. We stayed above on cliff and every moment of looking at this place was different and great on the eye. A must when in Puglia.",
          "You can look down from the bridge and find the local beach area stunning rock beach...people go lie down,soak up the sun or in the water they go...picturesque area,relaxing....the water is beautiful",
          "Absolutely stunning! If you are traveling to Puglia, you must visit Lama Monachile in Polignano a Mare. It is a site you will never forget, like as if you are walking into a postcard.",
          "The view of this cute little beach is fabulous from the bridge that crosses the ravine in Polignano a Mare! We managed to find the stairs leading to it and to walk right to the edge of the Adriatic sea. It is the romantic beach depicted in the biopic \"Volare - La grande Storia",
          "Always seen these amazing photos on the net, as everything when we expect too much we could get disappointed. We did. The entire beach is on rocks, unless you rent an umbrella and two lounges with Fly Restaurant at E30. Space is very limited and crowds arrived to take over this",
          "Looked amazing from far away. Pebble beach with blue blue waters. Warm to swim in. A bit of slime to deal with getting out. Need slip on dive shoes if you don't have tough feet. Hard to put umbrellas up as all stone area. Very popular. Not sure were the wast is going from",
          "The beach is packed just as in the photos, but people are having fun and the swimming is good. Getting in an out of the water is a bit of a challenge as the rocks are slippery. However, once you are in the water you can swim out into the bay and see the sights all around you,",
          "Another great view to learn to appreciate the Adriatic coastline. Wear good shoes to survive the cobblestones!",
          "We grabbed some gelato and walked down the ancient path to the beach. It was already quite crowded but was fun to sit and people watch. A very small little rocky beach with clear water.",
          "Beautiful water, fantastic mass of humanity all being very Italian, lots of young girls striking selfie poses, dogs being bathed very much against their will, body con men, older ladies, all enjoying very close up and personal beach going. Getting into the water a major",
          "This place is fabulous. The view is excellent and the crashing waves are spectacular. Be sure to bring a jacket, because the wind is strong here.",
          "A breath taking beach. I\u2019ve seen many but this one is really amazing. It hard no sand but seems to be wild, vegetation, bordered by natural stones walls and above it building. Really impressed by this scene.",
          "Nice shore, nice beach but too crowd. Clear water. Hope to return there. Polignano is nice and must see place if you stay in Bari.",
          "You can take some amazing photos of the beach but to actually swim there during the summer can be pretty tricky. It was really busy in August, so we literally put down our stuff on the top of a rock and just headed to the water. I'm not good with rocky beaches, so I ended up",
          "We visited in October and I\u2019d advise not to go earlier or it might be too crowded. It was a bit smaller than we expected from the photo\u2019s, but still very nice. The water was as clear as expected and still warm enough to go for a swim on a sunny day. There are plenty of look",
          "It is also called Cala Porto and I think it is the most photographed place in town, esspecialy from the bridge.The water is transparent and good for swimming but the beach is full of stones, no sand at all, so the sitting is very uncomfortable. But very nice view!",
          "Astonishing cove. Sitting on the beach I think it results more beautiful than it seems from the bridge view. A place of a timeless beauty. Really fascinating.",
          "This beach is stunning. It is great for a short visit and/or a walk on the rocks. It is also nice to swim in if the water is calm. Be prepared for rocks, and uncomfortable sitting. If you know what to expect, this is a great break!",
          "Dispite the numer of tourists (and their money), this beach has no one structure. Disgusting. Nevermore. Many places near are better, however in general Italy has very, very garbage on the streets, cities and roads...",
          "This seaside is famous because it was location for many movies? But it's quite difficult to reach and when you arrive there ard a lot of people. Sea isn't quiet because of the waves. It's very beautiful because of the wall on the two sides, but you cannot stay here a whole day.",
          "Nice rock beach into the city. Accessible from the main road under a bridge. Small but very beautiful colors. Not so confortable because of rocks but if you are prepared it's amazing. There is also a tunner of shadow in which you can go to the deep water just walking along. Then",
          "Small, rocky but very lovely beach, hidden among rocks. From the cliff, great views of the sea and the town as well as crystal clear water whose blue merges with the blue of the sky",
          "This is a stunning place to visit. It is a hidden gem in the middle of a historical town. There are caves all around if you like to go adventuring.",
          "Beautiful and not too many tourist. Water is cold and don't imagine anyone actually swimming there until June or July. Cute place to take pictures.",
          "Relaxing place, too bad we visited it in march and we couldn't go to swim a bit. I strongly recommend visiting it!",
          "This beach is one of the reasons Polignano a Mare is such a fantastic place. It's located between 2 cliffs on which the town is built and the view from either side (and also from the beach itself) is fantastic. Not sure how it is as a beach proper, though, as we were only",
          "This is an interesting short walk down into a beautiful little cove, complete with small shops along the way. We enjoyed walking through mounds of smoothly polished stones. The waves here are strong so no swimming, but enjoy great water action.",
          "One of the most stunning and interesting beaches I\u2019ve ever been to! Beautiful views and lovely restaurants to eat lunch overlooking the beach. I will return!",
          "Lovely pebble beach with amazingly blue, clear water, wonderful walkway, the reason it\u2019s a 4 star is because all of the trash.",
          "The beach is definitely worth visiting. To reach there you'd walk along the incredible seaside cliffs of Polignano. The beach imself is small but amazing view and crystal clear water. There's a interesting cave also. Recommend somekind of water shoes because there are stones.",
          "Small rocky beach (water shoes would be a real plus) but fantastic swimming. So gorgeous, the view can't be beat. Cliff diving at various levels, depending on how daring you are.",
          "This is THE place you probably want to spend some time if you are out in Polignano. The beach is small and can get crowded but the views of the city and cliffs from the beach are amazing and truly beautiful.",
          "A smallish beach, a cove really, with pebbles over sand. Wear waterproof shoes for comfort and set your towel up on the left side of the cove if you want all-day sun. Great place for selfies and people watching.",
          "This beach is located just below the place where we're staying. The water is beautiful, some swimming, a diver or two. Definitely worth visiting, just be careful walking on the stones as you go into or come out of the water.",
          "This is a very closed cove with turquoise water, and usually filled with people. We went in the beginning of October, and it was filled with people swimming and sunbathing. We didn't want to miss the opportunity, so we put on our swimwear and swam and sunbathed for hours. It was",
          "This beach is truly worth visiting. To reach there, you'd walk along the incredible seaside cliffs of Polignano a Mare, magnificent views, places to eat and drink, etc. The beach itself is beautiful. Take a dip and enjoy!",
          "the beach is amazing even very crowded you still enjoy. young people jumps from the surrounding cliffs and the persons on the beach are applauding them the view from up is fantastic you have to spend some hours there enjoying the atmosphere and the cool .water. i recommend it",
          "Beautiful beach, with a very clear water, but a lot of stones. It's worth going, but I couldn't go far in the water because I was afraid of falling.",
          "The bay is beautiful, long, with spectacular sand-stone side walls. And the city is on top of it. It's a must see if you're in the area. But there's a lot of people there, like you cant see the pebbles of the beach from the people :) If you swim a little bit out, then it's quite",
          "I thought this narrow little beach in the heart of Polignano a Mare would be a nightmare because of the crowds of people but it turns out that is part of the charm. Super busy and hard to find a flat spot big enough for your towel but just roll with it and sit down and enjoy the",
          "Amazing views and surroundings. The most photographed plaza in Polignano. Lots of people and stones on the beach.",
          "We have enjoyed both during the day and the sunset at this place! I recommend that you stay in Polignano one full day to live this experience day&night as this was one of the few things that stuck in my mind about our trip to Puglia! You will live its nature and the sight!",
          "Well worth the walk and the rocky beach to float in the crystal clear sea. Your really need some sort of foot cover to navigate the rocky beach.",
          "A great beach right at the heart of Polignan a Mare. Very busy on weekends, it is small and all rocks no sand! Crystal clear water and a great place to spend the day just relaxing, swimming and people watching.",
          "This has great views but is a very rocky beach without sand and shoes are needed . The water is clear and the cliffs are interesting but the area leading down to the beach is not well kept and could be better. Worth a look just because of the views of the ocean and cliffs and",
          "When you visit this beautiful town, remember to walk down the gorge and into the beautiful beach with white pebbles and sand. An unforgettable experience.",
          "Words can't describe this place. If you are in southeast Italy you have to go here. Or even if you aren't it is worth the trip here. We were here when the weather was 20 degrees Fahrenheit colder than usual but it didn't even matter. We are coming back as soon we can.",
          "It is only a short walk down to the small beach but well worth it. The view and perspective of the historic city and ancient bridge is amazing. It would be strenious for and older person or somebody with any mobility issues however.",
          "Miss this place would be a sin, at least for short time walking around, enjoyng the views, the old town is worth a visit",
          "If you come to Polignano a Mare, you have to see this unique little cove. This is a place that has captured lots of attention because of the Red Bull cliff diving competitions, but it merits attention for its beauty alone. If you do swim though, LOOK OUT FOR JELLY FISH!!!",
          "This beach is located in town and can be reached easily on foot. Went in mid-Oct so wasn't keen on swimming, but would have done so in high season, The water looked quite inviting even in Autumn/ Fall There is a spectacular bridge which adds to the romance and beauty of the",
          "Small beach with white pebbles and green and blue water , just in the centre of the town. From the Monachile Lama bridge is possible to admire one of the most attractive views of Polignano a Mare",
          "Went for a morning swim at 7:00 AM, and had this rocky gem of a beach to ourselves. The water is so clear it sparkles with visibility well over 20 feet. Lots of grottoes, no rip. Those little rocks are feet eaters. Wear your water shoes, or at least take your sandals to the",
          "Beautiful place to visit and relax for a while. The beach is rocky so not really comfortable but swimming, snorkeling and jumping is what you should definitely do there.",
          "The most famous beach in Polignano a Mare. Its not a good place for swimming because there is full of people. On the opposite cliffs there is Red Bull Water Jumping Event every year.",
          "Great little rocky beach, clear water, caves to swim into, busy great for people watching. Lots of locals which is good.",
          "A great landscape that surrounds this rocky beach makes it perfect to photograph from the bridge above or at sea level. A cave to swim through makes it a popular location. Be aware glass in between many of the rocks where the sea meets the shore!",
          "I was there yesterday and the water was so blue the view was fantastic, and there is a very interesting cave on the beach too , i took amazing photos and spent one of the best times ever in italy",
          "This is a beautiful beach whether you are on the beach and looking up at the cliffs and the town or whether you are in town looking at the beach below. It can be very crowded and is extremely popular.",
          "This is the main beach in Polignano, so it gets extremely crowded and dirty. Unless you can go there early in the morning or in the evening, it's probably better to go further afield to find nicer (and sandy) beaches. This one has stones, larger rocks and no sand.",
          "There are two \u201cbeaches\" in Polignano a \\mare, The best beach is in the centre of town with the cliffs around it. It's lovely to float around looking up at all the people looking down from the cliffs. There are sunbeds available as part of the pizza restaurant on the left but",
          "Small beach between the clifs. It looks very special with the housese which are build on the cliffs. The beach itself is nice to see, not suitable for a day of swimming. Mainly rocks and a lot of glass between stones and pebbles. But take a stay for half an hour and walk in the",
          "One of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. The beautiful view of the beach with its green water and the rocks around it is breath taking!",
          "We first viewed this little cove when wandering around the historic center of Polignano. The next day we went to explore and go for a swim. It is a free beach and very popular so get there early, it gets crowded. There is a tunnel through the rocks you can walk through to",
          "This is the most photographed scene in Polignano and when you see it you will know why - just stunning. You will have no choice but to see it as this is the scene when you drive in to old town area of Polignano. Enjoy.",
          "I parked in the public lot and was walking to lunch in the old town along a pedestrian stairway that runs behind the streets, when my eye was caught by this stunning scene. I walked down to the beach and it was really really pretty. Not a great beach (stones, not sand like",
          "First off this is one of the most beautiful places I have ever had the chance to see. I fist viewed it from the high rocks to the left of this little beach cove. It was stunning. After making our way down at around 10 am it was already starting to fill up with families and"

          "Busy but not packed on a Wednesday in July. Don\u2019t go expecting a long relaxing day on the beach. We found a spot and then enjoyed jumping off the rock platform and swimming around the cove and enjoying the magnificent surroundings. Rock shoes highly recommended to fully enjoy the ocean.",

          "Beautiful place with amazing views. Over the night whole area is luminated which makes it even more interesting. The only thing that surprised me was amount of garbage on cliffs ...but I guess that this is caused by reckless tourists.",
          "I give it a 4 because the views are incredible and hey it\u2019s a cool Italian beach!! It\u2019s a rocky beach. You are much better off wearing flip flops or shoes. Better yet if you have shoes you can wear in the water you won\u2019t regret it. Everyone \u2026",
          "Great spot to relax, not too many people at this time of the year. Unfortunately, there is a lot of glasses on the ground from broken bottles which made the experience less amazing.",
          "Fantastic !!! Must see ...\n\nWe parked car a few streets away and walked 10mins to get to this amazing and beautiful place. \n\nThe family had a fantastic swim and we all dived off the rocks.\n\nHighly recommended for day trip.",
          "Sitting right here while writing this review :) Rule number one: avoid this place on weekends :D first time we visited this beach on Sunday and decided that, even though it's beautiful and the water is crystal clear, we wouldn't come back \u2026",

          "Best viewpoint from the top. Beautiful even in this unusual stormy day.",
          "A rocky beach with a spectacular view. The water is crystal clear and there is more space to settle with your gear than it looks at the first time. The cliffs provides a bit shade during the day.",
          "Great for a day visit if you are in the area.Probably best in the summer,there are a few beaches/cooling off places dotted around.Usual cafes, restaurants, pizzerias.Monopoli is maybe a little better for beaches.Harbours in both villages are picturesque.",
          "This beach has a HUGE wow factor !!!! It\u2019s absolutely beautiful !!! Coming from Australia I was unsure if I would be impressed but it took my breath away. We first saw it from the bridge then walked into the old town from above for another \u2026",
          "Beautiful place but absolutely packed. There were more people than pebbles on the beach! Granted it was a Saturday.",

          "This beach is one of the best spot of Apulia. You should come here at least once. I would advise to come very early to find a spot because it gets very crowded during the morning",
          "Beautiful beach but it is far too difficult to enjoy as part of a holiday due to the crowds. Pop in for a quick swim but I recommend getting out of town to a more chilled beach.",

          "Very beautiful. Worst to visit",
          "WOW! What a beautiful place! Nature is so gorgeous...",
          "3 stars is pushing it. It's a nice location but it's small, a rocky beach and not very well kept. As an Australian this beach isn't very good but the water is clean. Bring an umbrella because there's no shade and don't leave your bag unattended because there are pickpockets.",
          "Small but breathtaking spot to take in the sun and join the rest of those in Polignano a Mare for a day at the city beach. Accessible by stairs and right below the centro storico of the city, this little alcove beach is for strong swimmers! \u2026",

          "A beautiful stripe of rocks in the middle of the city. Free for access and really good to enjoy. Its a small beach, so make sure to choose the right time to go depending on the season. One advantage is that as it's between two cliffs there \u2026",

          "Magical place, but you need came very early because close to lunch time there is a lot of people",
          "Beautiful and picturesque pebble beach and swimming area, cut in between the cliffs, a narrow stretch of water, with grottos and caves carved into the rocks. Amazing location, even better with the setting sun.",
          "Worst beach I've ever put my foot on, nice view though. Not recommend to take a shower here",

          "Beautiful beach with stunning scenery",

To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, the Cathedral of San Sabino (1035\u20131171) and the Hohenstaufen Castle built for Frederick II, which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district (the via Sparano and via Argiro).\nModern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s. The city has a redeveloped airport, Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, with connections to several European cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe city was probably founded by the Peucetii. The city had strong Greek influences and once it passed under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were dependent on the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter the devastations of the Gothic Wars, under Longobard rule a set of written regulations was established, the Consuetudines Barenses, which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities. Until the arrival of the Normans, Bari continued to be governed by the Longobards and Byzantines, with only occasional interruption.\nThroughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major slave depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in Slavic slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by Venice from Dalmatia, the Holy Roman Empire from what is now Prussia and Poland, and the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Fatimid Caliphate (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba Mamluks).For 20 years, Bari was the centre of the Emirate of Bari; the city was captured by its first emirs Kalfun in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by Radelchis I of Benevento. The city was conquered and the Emirate extinguished in 871, due to the efforts of Emperor Louis II and a Byzantine fleet. Chris Wickham states Louis spent five years campaigning to reduce then occupy Bari, \"and then only to a Byzantine/Slav naval blockade\"; \"Louis took the credit\" for the success, adding \"at least in Frankish eyes\", then concludes by noting that by remaining in southern Italy long after this success, he \"achieved the near-impossible: an alliance against him of the Beneventans, Salernitans, Neapolitans and Spoletans; later sources include Sawad\u0101n as well.\" In 885, Bari became the residence of the local Byzantine catapan, or governor. The failed revolt (1009\u20131011) of the Lombard nobles Melus of Bari and his brother-in-law Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the Battle of Cannae (1018), offered their Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted \"provincial\" status.\nIn 1071, Bari was captured by Robert Guiscard, following a three-year siege. Maio of Bari (died 1160), a Lombard merchant's son, was the third of the great admirals of Norman Sicily. The Basilica di San Nicola was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from Myra in Lycia, in Byzantine territory. The saint began his development from Saint Nicholas of Myra into Saint Nicholas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the economy of Bari. In 1095 Peter the Hermit preached the first crusade there. In October 1098, Urban II, who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the Council of Bari, one of a series of synods convoked with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the filioque clause in the Creed, which Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the Great Schism was inevitable.\nA civil war broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by Grimoald Alferanites, a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with Byzantium and Venice and taken the title gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to Roger II of Sicily, but rebelled and was defeated in 1132.\nBari was occupied by Manuel I Komnenos between 1155 and 1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nIsabella d\u2019Aragona, princess of Naples and widow of the Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, enlarged the castle, which she made her residence, 1499\u20131524. After the death of Queen Bona Sforza, of Poland, Bari came to be included in the Kingdom of Naples and its history contracted to a local one, as malaria became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist grid plan, which bears his name today as the Murattiano. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of Mussolini can be seen in the imposing architecture along the seafront.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 11 September 1943, in connection with the Armistice of Cassibile, Bari was taken without resistance by the British 1st Airborne Division, then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.\nThe Balkan Air Force supporting the Yugoslav partisans was based at Bari.\n\n\n==== The 1943 chemical warfare disaster ====\n\nThrough a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in World War II, Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience chemical warfare in the course of that war.\nOn the night of 2 December 1943, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacked the port of Bari, which was a key supply centre for Allied forces fighting their way up the Italian Peninsula. Over 20 Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship John Harvey, which was carrying mustard gas; mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport (the chemical agent was intended for retaliation if German forces had initiated chemical warfare.) The presence of the gas was highly classified and the U.S. had not informed the British military authorities in the city of its existence. This increased the number of fatalities, since British physicians\u2014who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas\u2014prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties, many additional casualties were caused among the rescuers, through contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.\nFollowing the attack, the harbor was closed for operations for three weeks and it did not return to full capacity until February 1944.\nA member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid.  Alexander had trained at the Army's Edgewood Arsenal in New Jersey, and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the John Harvey, and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, Mustine.On the orders of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book Disaster at Bari. Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: \"[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen\". Others put the count as high as \"more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians\".Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed \"The Little Pearl Harbor\" after the Japanese air attack on the American naval base in Hawaii, was highly destructive in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, has proved far from easy.\nThe affair is the subject of two books: Disaster at Bari, by Glenn B. Infield, and Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup, by Gerald Reminick.\nIn 1988 through the efforts of Nick T. Spark, U.S. Senators Dennis DeConcini and Bill Bradley, Dr. Stewart Alexander received recognition from the Surgeon General of the United States Army for his actions during the Bari disaster.\n\n\n==== Charles Henderson explosion ====\nThe port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship Charles Henderson exploded in the harbour while offloading 2000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered nonoperational, this time for a month.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBari is the largest urban and metro area on the Adriatic.  It is located in Southern Italy, at a more northerly latitude than Naples, further south than Rome.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBari has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nShown above are the nine governmental community boards (Municipalities) of Bari: these are further divided into twenty neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\n\nTeatro Margherita.\nTeatro Piccinni.\nOrto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bari, a botanical garden.\nSanta Chiara, once church of the Teutonic Knights (as Santa maria degli Alemanni) and now houses a museum. It was restored in 1539.\nThe Acquedotto Pugliese\nThe medieval church of San Marco dei Veneziani, with a rose window in the fa\u00e7ade.\nConservatory of Bari\nSan Giorgio degli Armeni.\nSanta Teresa dei Maschi, the main Baroque church in the city (1690\u20131696).\nPane e Pomodoro Beach is the main beach within reach of the city. Its reputation has for several years suffered from the apparent presence of asbestos from nearby industrial plants.\nBari features two sea harbours: the Old Port and the New Port, constructed in 1850.\n\n\n==== Basilica of Saint Nicholas ====\n\nThe Basilica di San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from Myra in Lycia, and now lie beneath the altar in the crypt, where are buried the Topins, which are a legacy of old thieves converted to good faith. The church is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia (the others being the cathedrals of Acquaviva delle Fonti and Altamura, and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano).\n\n\n==== Bari Cathedral ====\nBari Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Sabinus of Canosa (San Sabino), was begun in Byzantine style in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170 and 1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the transept.\nAn example of Apulian Romanesque architecture, the church has a simple Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The crypt houses the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.\nThe interior and the fa\u00e7ade were redecorated in Baroque style during the 18th century, but these additions were removed in a 1950s restoration.\n\n\n==== Petruzzelli Theatre ====\nThe Petruzzelli Theatre, founded in 1903, hosted different forms of live entertainment, or nineteenth century \u201cPoliteama\u201d.  The theatre was all but destroyed in a fire on October 27, 1991. It was reopened in October 2009, after 18 years.\n\n\n==== Swabian Castle ====\n\nThe Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the Castello Svevo (Swabian Castle), was built by Roger II of Sicily around 1131. Destroyed in 1156, it was rebuilt by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.\n\n\n==== Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari ====\nThe Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari (Provincial Picture Gallery of Bari) is the most important art gallery in Apulia. It was first established in 1928 and contains many paintings from the 15th century up to the days of contemporary art.\n\n\n==== The Russian Church ====\nThe Russian Church of Saint Nicholas, in the Carrassi district of Bari, was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nicholas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.\nThe city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a trade-off with the Putin government in Moscow, exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a military barracks near Bari's central railway station.\n\n\n==== Barivecchia ====\nBarivecchia, or Old Bari, is a sprawl of streets and passageways making up the section of the city to the north of the modern Murat area. Barivecchia was until fairly recently considered a no-go area by many of Bari's residents due to the high levels of petty crime. A large-scale redevelopment plan began with a new sewerage system, followed by the development of the two main squares, Piazza Mercantile and Piazza Ferrarese.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 2015, there were 326,344 people residing in Bari (about 1.6 million live in the greater Bari area), located in the province of Bari, Puglia, of whom 47.9% were male and 52.1% were female. As of 2007, minors (children ages 18 and younger) totaled 17.90 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.08 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bari residents is 42 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bari grew by 2.69 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bari is 8.67 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.As of 2015, 3.8% of the population was foreign residents.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nAccording to an urban migration study in Bari, return migration gain to urban areas is higher than migration loss from urban areas. People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy.  Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes. Under 2% of migrants left Bari to go abroad and came to the city from abroad.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Fiera del Levante ===\nThe Fiera del Levante, held in September in the Fiera site on the west side of Bari city center, focuses on agriculture and industry,  There is also a \"Fair of Nations\" which displays handcrafted and locally produced goods from all over the world.\n\n\n=== Cuisine and gastronomy ===\n\nBari's cuisine is based on three typical agricultural products found within the surrounding region of Apulia, namely wheat, olive oil and wine. The local cuisine is also enriched by the wide variety of fruit and vegetables produced locally. Local flour is used in homemade bread and pasta production including, most notably, the famous orecchiette ear-shaped pasta, recchietelle or strascinate, chiancarelle (orecchiette of different sizes) and cavatelli.\nHomemade dough is also used for baked calzoni stuffed with onions, anchovies, capers and olives; fried panzerotti with mozzarella, simple focaccia alla barese with tomatoes, little savoury taralli, friselle and sgagliozze, fried slices of polenta, all make up the Bari culinary repertoire.\nVegetable minestrone, chick peas, broad beans, chicory, celery and fennel are also often served as first courses or side dishes.\nMeat dishes and the local Barese rag\u00f9 often include lamb and pork.\nPasta al forno, a baked pasta dish, is very popular in Bari and was historically a Sunday dish, or a dish used at the start of Lent when all the rich ingredients such as eggs and pork had to be used for religious reasons. The recipe commonly consists of penne or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with mozzarella or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.\nFresh fish and seafood are often eaten raw. Octopus, sea urchins and mussels feature heavily. Perhaps Bari's most famous dish is the oven-baked patate, riso e cozze (potatoes with rice and mussels).\nBari and the whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including Primitivo, Castel del Monte, and Muscat, notably Moscato di Trani.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe dialect of Bari belongs to the upper-southern Italo-Romance  family, and currently coexists with Italian; generally these are used in different contexts.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nLocal football club S.S.C. Bari, currently competing in Serie C (as of the 2019\u20132020 season), plays in the Stadio San Nicola, an architecturally innovative 58,000-seater stadium purpose-built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The stadium also hosted the 1991 European Cup Final.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBari has its own airport, Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, which is located 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of the centre of Bari. It is connected to the centre by train services from Bari Aeroporto railway station.\nBari Central Station lies on the Adriatic railway and has connection to cities such as Rome, Milan, Bologna, Turin and Venice. Another mainline is connection southwards by the Bari-Taranto railway. Regional services also operate to Foggia, Barletta, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto and other towns and villages in the Apulia region.\nBari has an old fishery port (Porto Vecchio) and a so-called new port in the north, as well as some marinas. The Port of Bari is an important cargo transport hub to S.E.Europe. Various passenger transport lines include some seasonal ferry lines to Albania, Montenegro or Dubrovnik. Bari-Igoumenitsa is a popular ferry line to Greece, some cruise ships anchor in Bari too.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bari, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 minutes. 11% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 18 minutes, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km (2.6 mi), while 2% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2014 sister cities ==\n\nBari is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Guido Guerrieri novels by Gianrico Carofiglio are set in Bari, where Guerrieri is a criminal lawyer, and include many descriptions of the town.\nBari is one of the primary settings of the detective novel The Black Mountain by Rex Stout. It is the characters' point of embarkation to Communist Yugoslavia.\nIn the 1995 film The Bridges of Madison County, Italian housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), is mentioned as being from Bari and growing up in Naples.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccademia Apulia\nAntivari (means \"opposite Bari\")\nBari Light, the Punta San Cataldo di Bari Lighthouse\nDurres\nPolytechnic University of Bari\nProvince of Bari\nUniversity of Bari\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nGlenn B.

          "Every year is less and less inviting. Starting from the fact that the parking lots that are free on Sunday ... yesterday were all paid (from 3 to 5 euros), then you pay the entrance fee and then if you buy a focaccia \u2026",
          "Placed on the sea, well-kept pavilions you feel at the center of the world\n\n",
          "As a child, living in Bari was a magical place. It has never evolved, despite many words. Today it is considered a thousand miles away from a sample. It remained a fair, but without the charm it had on me as a child. \u2026",
          "As already mentioned by others, it is no longer the fair of the past, it has become impoverished, but perhaps this is due to the ease with which everything is now everywhere ... however, it is expected every year, and \u2026",
          "A fair now distorted by the trans national characteristic that characterized it until a decade ago, reduced to an almost local event.\nAlways and in any case a fair to visit for the considerable offer of the \u2026",
          "Beautiful but only after letting more than 10 years pass from one edition to another. Very negative note, in the sports pavilion only a couple of sports associations, this says a lot about how the Levante fair is \u2026",
          "It could be a great place for events, but in fact I see degradation. In addition to the famous Fiera del Levante, courses, fairs and meetings are held here during the rest of the year. But it is not very welcoming \u2026",
          "Better than the last few years. Beautiful new furniture pavilion, beautiful light show, delicious focaccia di Palesano. For 3 \u20ac all in all I spent a nice afternoon.\n\n",

          "Beautiful but increasingly disappointing from year to year. Public and private car parks cost more than entrance fees. I wonder if next year will be worth going to.\n\n",
          "It is no longer the Fiera del Levante many years ago. It has literally emptied out. You can visit it in maximum 4 hours. Perhaps it is also due to the presence at the Fair of numerous dedicated events and this implies \u2026",
          "He has lost the glories of the past. It should be used in the best way x various trade shows. The seat Bari Eataly is now what remains of the beautiful Bari fair. And with time they were also scaled down the Eataly \u2026",

          "A beautiful place. There are several interesting events. There are also good restaurants. Council to visit it.\n\n",
          "Externally rather modest structure, decrepit ticket offices, but the pavilion that had been set up was well placed, with more than enough services, good lighting, well beyond the sufficiency. We hope that it continues \u2026",

        "wiki": "Bari ( BAR-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ba\u02d0ri] (listen); Barese: Bare [\u02c8b\u00e6\u02d0r\u0259]; Latin: Barium; Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, romanized: B\u00e1rion) is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia  region, on the Adriatic Sea, in southern Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples (and the third after Palermo, if Insular Italy is included), a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of 320,257 inhabitants, over 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), while the  urban area has 750,000 inhabitants. The metropolitan area has 1.3 million inhabitants.\nBari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, the Cathedral of San Sabino (1035\u20131171) and the Hohenstaufen Castle built for Frederick II, which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district (the via Sparano and via Argiro).\nModern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s. The city has a redeveloped airport, Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, with connections to several European cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe city was probably founded by the Peucetii. The city had strong Greek influences and once it passed under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were dependent on the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter the devastations of the Gothic Wars, under Longobard rule a set of written regulations was established, the Consuetudines Barenses, which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities. Until the arrival of the Normans, Bari continued to be governed by the Longobards and Byzantines, with only occasional interruption.\nThroughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major slave depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in Slavic slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by Venice from Dalmatia, the Holy Roman Empire from what is now Prussia and Poland, and the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Fatimid Caliphate (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba Mamluks).For 20 years, Bari was the centre of the Emirate of Bari; the city was captured by its first emirs Kalfun in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by Radelchis I of Benevento. The city was conquered and the Emirate extinguished in 871, due to the efforts of Emperor Louis II and a Byzantine fleet. Chris Wickham states Louis spent five years campaigning to reduce then occupy Bari, \"and then only to a Byzantine/Slav naval blockade\"; \"Louis took the credit\" for the success, adding \"at least in Frankish eyes\", then concludes by noting that by remaining in southern Italy long after this success, he \"achieved the near-impossible: an alliance against him of the Beneventans, Salernitans, Neapolitans and Spoletans; later sources include Sawad\u0101n as well.\" In 885, Bari became the residence of the local Byzantine catapan, or governor. The failed revolt (1009\u20131011) of the Lombard nobles Melus of Bari and his brother-in-law Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the Battle of Cannae (1018), offered their Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted \"provincial\" status.\nIn 1071, Bari was captured by Robert Guiscard, following a three-year siege. Maio of Bari (died 1160), a Lombard merchant's son, was the third of the great admirals of Norman Sicily. The Basilica di San Nicola was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from Myra in Lycia, in Byzantine territory. The saint began his development from Saint Nicholas of Myra into Saint Nicholas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the economy of Bari. In 1095 Peter the Hermit preached the first crusade there. In October 1098, Urban II, who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the Council of Bari, one of a series of synods convoked with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the filioque clause in the Creed, which Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the Great Schism was inevitable.\nA civil war broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by Grimoald Alferanites, a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with Byzantium and Venice and taken the title gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to Roger II of Sicily, but rebelled and was defeated in 1132.\nBari was occupied by Manuel I Komnenos between 1155 and 1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nIsabella d\u2019Aragona, princess of Naples and widow of the Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, enlarged the castle, which she made her residence, 1499\u20131524. After the death of Queen Bona Sforza, of Poland, Bari came to be included in the Kingdom of Naples and its history contracted to a local one, as malaria became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist grid plan, which bears his name today as the Murattiano. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of Mussolini can be seen in the imposing architecture along the seafront.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 11 September 1943, in connection with the Armistice of Cassibile, Bari was taken without resistance by the British 1st Airborne Division, then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.\nThe Balkan Air Force supporting the Yugoslav partisans was based at Bari.\n\n\n==== The 1943 chemical warfare disaster ====\n\nThrough a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in World War II, Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience chemical warfare in the course of that war.\nOn the night of 2 December 1943, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacked the port of Bari, which was a key supply centre for Allied forces fighting their way up the Italian Peninsula. Over 20 Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship John Harvey, which was carrying mustard gas; mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport (the chemical agent was intended for retaliation if German forces had initiated chemical warfare.) The presence of the gas was highly classified and the U.S. had not informed the British military authorities in the city of its existence. This increased the number of fatalities, since British physicians\u2014who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas\u2014prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties, many additional casualties were caused among the rescuers, through contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.\nFollowing the attack, the harbor was closed for operations for three weeks and it did not return to full capacity until February 1944.\nA member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid.  Alexander had trained at the Army's Edgewood Arsenal in New Jersey, and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the John Harvey, and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, Mustine.On the orders of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book Disaster at Bari. Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: \"[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen\". Others put the count as high as \"more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians\".Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed \"The Little Pearl Harbor\" after the Japanese air attack on the American naval base in Hawaii, was highly destructive in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, has proved far from easy.\nThe affair is the subject of two books: Disaster at Bari, by Glenn B. Infield, and Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup, by Gerald Reminick.\nIn 1988 through the efforts of Nick T. Spark, U.S. Senators Dennis DeConcini and Bill Bradley, Dr. Stewart Alexander received recognition from the Surgeon General of the United States Army for his actions during the Bari disaster.\n\n\n==== Charles Henderson explosion ====\nThe port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship Charles Henderson exploded in the harbour while offloading 2000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered nonoperational, this time for a month.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBari is the largest urban and metro area on the Adriatic.  It is located in Southern Italy, at a more northerly latitude than Naples, further south than Rome.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBari has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nShown above are the nine governmental community boards (Municipalities) of Bari: these are further divided into twenty neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\n\nTeatro Margherita.\nTeatro Piccinni.\nOrto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bari, a botanical garden.\nSanta Chiara, once church of the Teutonic Knights (as Santa maria degli Alemanni) and now houses a museum. It was restored in 1539.\nThe Acquedotto Pugliese\nThe medieval church of San Marco dei Veneziani, with a rose window in the fa\u00e7ade.\nConservatory of Bari\nSan Giorgio degli Armeni.\nSanta Teresa dei Maschi, the main Baroque church in the city (1690\u20131696).\nPane e Pomodoro Beach is the main beach within reach of the city. Its reputation has for several years suffered from the apparent presence of asbestos from nearby industrial plants.\nBari features two sea harbours: the Old Port and the New Port, constructed in 1850.\n\n\n==== Basilica of Saint Nicholas ====\n\nThe Basilica di San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from Myra in Lycia, and now lie beneath the altar in the crypt, where are buried the Topins, which are a legacy of old thieves converted to good faith. The church is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia (the others being the cathedrals of Acquaviva delle Fonti and Altamura, and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano).\n\n\n==== Bari Cathedral ====\nBari Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Sabinus of Canosa (San Sabino), was begun in Byzantine style in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170 and 1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the transept.\nAn example of Apulian Romanesque architecture, the church has a simple Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The crypt houses the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.\nThe interior and the fa\u00e7ade were redecorated in Baroque style during the 18th century, but these additions were removed in a 1950s restoration.\n\n\n==== Petruzzelli Theatre ====\nThe Petruzzelli Theatre, founded in 1903, hosted different forms of live entertainment, or nineteenth century \u201cPoliteama\u201d.  The theatre was all but destroyed in a fire on October 27, 1991. It was reopened in October 2009, after 18 years.\n\n\n==== Swabian Castle ====\n\nThe Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the Castello Svevo (Swabian Castle), was built by Roger II of Sicily around 1131. Destroyed in 1156, it was rebuilt by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.\n\n\n==== Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari ====\nThe Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari (Provincial Picture Gallery of Bari) is the most important art gallery in Apulia. It was first established in 1928 and contains many paintings from the 15th century up to the days of contemporary art.\n\n\n==== The Russian Church ====\nThe Russian Church of Saint Nicholas, in the Carrassi district of Bari, was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nicholas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.\nThe city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a trade-off with the Putin government in Moscow, exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a military barracks near Bari's central railway station.\n\n\n==== Barivecchia ====\nBarivecchia, or Old Bari, is a sprawl of streets and passageways making up the section of the city to the north of the modern Murat area. Barivecchia was until fairly recently considered a no-go area by many of Bari's residents due to the high levels of petty crime. A large-scale redevelopment plan began with a new sewerage system, followed by the development of the two main squares, Piazza Mercantile and Piazza Ferrarese.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 2015, there were 326,344 people residing in Bari (about 1.6 million live in the greater Bari area), located in the province of Bari, Puglia, of whom 47.9% were male and 52.1% were female. As of 2007, minors (children ages 18 and younger) totaled 17.90 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.08 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bari residents is 42 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bari grew by 2.69 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bari is 8.67 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.As of 2015, 3.8% of the population was foreign residents.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nAccording to an urban migration study in Bari, return migration gain to urban areas is higher than migration loss from urban areas. People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy.  Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes.

The recipe commonly consists of penne or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with mozzarella or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.\nFresh fish and seafood are often eaten raw. Octopus, sea urchins and mussels feature heavily. Perhaps Bari's most famous dish is the oven-baked patate, riso e cozze (potatoes with rice and mussels).\nBari and the whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including Primitivo, Castel del Monte, and Muscat, notably Moscato di Trani.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe dialect of Bari belongs to the upper-southern Italo-Romance  family, and currently coexists with Italian; generally these are used in different contexts.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nLocal football club S.S.C.

The stadium also hosted the 1991 European Cup Final.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBari has its own airport, Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, which is located 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of the centre of Bari. It is connected to the centre by train services from Bari Aeroporto railway station.\nBari Central Station lies on the Adriatic railway and has connection to cities such as Rome, Milan, Bologna, Turin and Venice. Another mainline is connection southwards by the Bari-Taranto railway. Regional services also operate to Foggia, Barletta, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto and other towns and villages in the Apulia region.\nBari has an old fishery port (Porto Vecchio) and a so-called new port in the north, as well as some marinas. The Port of Bari is an important cargo transport hub to S.E.Europe. Various passenger transport lines include some seasonal ferry lines to Albania, Montenegro or Dubrovnik. Bari-Igoumenitsa is a popular ferry line to Greece, some cruise ships anchor in Bari too.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bari, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 minutes. 11% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day.

          "There was apparently a time when visitors would help themselves to a little souvenir and therefore the more delicate rock formations have all been broken off. It seems more is being done to protect the caves now, but the damage has been done and this cave is far from pristine.",
          "The caves are really nice and the tour guide(english) war okay. I was there with small children and they have also enjoyed the short tour. I was in a lot of caves-these are pretty but you cannot compare it to the Slovenian Postojna caves or Skocnjan caves.",
          "Nice caves. We took the fully tour. It's a walk of a little bit more than 3 km but it are good walkable roads so you only need good shoes and really walking shoes.",
          "We were travelling in a tour group and so had our own guide. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, it's somewhat chaotic at the beginning even you have a booking. I've been in a variety of caves before so these weren't particularly spectacular although they are",
          "Enjoyed our guided tour through the Grotte di Castellana. Definitely worth booking in advance and doing the longer tour which takes in the 'white caves' which is particularly spectacular. Takes around 2 hours in total and tour guides provide interesting explanations of the",
          "Make sure to be there at least 20 minutes before the time you would like to enter- the caves could only be visited with a guided tour, and the tours in languages other than Italian are only few times a day. We got there just 5 minutes before the scheduled entry time for a tour",
          "One of the most interesting caves I\u2019ve seen. It is more beautiful than the one from Mallorca. There are 2 tours: without white gallery, 12\u20ac/person 1,5 km, 1 hour or with white cave included 16\u20ac/person 3 km, 2 hours. I\u2019ve booked the one with the cave included! Definitely, when",
          "The caves are very easy to find and there is plenty of cheap parking. The attraction is fairly priced but they will try to get you to hire a jacket as they claim it's chilly in the caves but unless you live in the desert you will be fine and never wear the jacket. The cave are",
          "These are fantastic limestone caverns, many thousands of years in the making. Opt for the 2 hour tour as you see much more and the best parts are deep into the cave and you won't see them on the short tour. One column is 12 metres high, and at 40 years per cm of growth, you can",
          "The caves themselves were amazing, but defiantly get tickets online before arriving saves queuing or ages, but unless you print at home, you still have to queue to collect your ticket. As you go further into the caves it gets quite tight and can get very crowded and if you",
          "We did the full tour of 2.5 km to the \u201cwhite cave\u201d. Amazing views, great explanations and well organized. It\u2019s a very popular destination, so count in some time in the queues. Inside the cave it is really safe and easy to walk.",
          "It is one of the largest cave system in Italy. First thing I noticed is a large opening that lets the sunlight pass through, creating a celestial effect. This light first illuminates the walls, then the stalagmites, and finally the irregular ground of the cave floor. Inside the",
          "Fantastic site. First you descend into a huge cavern with an opening at the top through which the sunlight allows vegetation to grow inside. Through a number of caves and cracks, covered with stalagites and stalagmites in all shapes and forms, you reach the so called white cave",
          "What an amazing place! The cavern system is full of stunning formations of stalactites and stalagmites ; the Roman wolf, an owl, cauliflowers... It's a long walk, though, and not a gentle stroll either. The guide knew her stuff and was very friendly. Our nearly 8 year old was",
          "I loved the tour, the tour lady was very nice and she kept it interesting. We took the 2h tour and I thought it would be too much but it\u2019s so interesting that it was over in a second. Definitely would go again!! Big like...",
          "We took the complete tour in English at 11.00 am. The complete tour brings you all the way to the white cave. Total distance to walk is about 3 km. And it takes about 2 hours to complete. The guides give good information. Temperature inside the caves is between 16-18 degrees. No",

          "What a truly magical place. Our tour guide for the caves was great and very informative. It's a must visit location. Make sure you do the full tour though.",
          "We picked the 2 hours 4pm English tour - it was really very impressive. I've seen a number of caves around the world - but this one was really spectacular, and also a nice break from the sunshine by the pool. The guides were well versed and helpful. I managed the tour",
          "Impressive, this cave is a must visit place if you ever visit the area. Just amazing, we did enjoy our short tour just to regret that we did not go all the way.",
          "These were the best caves I've ever visited. It involves a 3km walk through tunnels and numerous caves, all adorned with thousands of stalactites and stalagmites. They were lit to accentuate the beauty and as we finished our tour the sunlight shining through the cave made a",
          "We were lucky enough to have no queue for the tickets for the 10 o'clock full length, 2 hours, 3km visit. The group was quite large though, perhaps 40-50 people. The guides were ok (one speaking in front, one repeating if requested, and closing the group on the back), but the",
          "The caves are HUGGGGGGE! You have 2 options when you purchase the tickets: the short walk (1km which takes 50mins) and the 3 km walk (2hours). The only negative is that you have to go with a guide and that NO PHOTOS ARE ALLOWED. This policy so annoys me! No flash i understand",
          "We took the long tour (which was available in English only twice a day at 11am and 4pm when we visited) which took us 1.5km through the tunnels to the white cave then back again a similar but not identical route. The full trip lasted around 2 hours and the large crowd at the",
          "May 18 Tours of Puglia included this excursion which we all enjoyed. This cavern was accidentally discovered in 1938 when some farmers found a sinkhole and descended down. We were in an English-speaking tour with many other tours occurring concurrently. This is one attraction",
          "I was completely astonished about how awesome this was. I would 100% go. Take the long tour (it is not that long) to make sure you go all the way to the end to see the white cave. Make sure you check the internet for the time of the tour for your language. Our guide was",
          "Well worth the visit. We chose the short tour which for us was enough as it is quite tiring but well worth it. The work that been done to enable visitors to walk around is outstanding, with the lighting and pathways making it a really great experience. Ensure you check the",
          "Rarely given to superlatives, but this attraction beats many others. We did the long tour of 1hr 50mins, well worth it. They seemed to have solved the logistics of moving large different groups of people very efficiently, without causing any bottlenecks.",
          "We choose the one hour tour into the cave which was a good choice for us. There are stairs the lead down into the cave down a multiple teared stairs with many steps. Not a great idea for any folks with health issues. Under ground it is cool, damp and some times humid.The tour is",
          "We had an English speaking tour Daniella, who gave a very informative tour which lasted for nearly 2hrs, and was worth the time and walking. The sites in the caves were amazing, breath taking at times. Well worth a visit.",
          "We went because we had a rainy day and it was something to do but it turned out to be brilliant! Pictures don\u2019t do it justice (particularly since you are only allowed to take them in the first bit and it gets so much better!). It is worth doing the long tour and the guide had",
          "We opted for the longer tour, which got as far as the incredible white cave. Amazing stalactites and stalagmites, with beautfiul lighting. Interestingly it wasn't that cold or wet in the caves, despite torrential rain outside. The guide was interesting and spoke good english",
          "If you have seen large stalagmite/stalactite caves before this cave system will not exactly floor you but it is definitely worth a visit. There are well over two hundred stairs that you have to climb down so this only works for people that are good on their feet. Luckily there",
          "This was definitely worth it, the caves are I believe the biggest open ones in EU. Really impressive to see",
          "we went to visit the caves and they were very impressive. We took the longer visit and it is certainly worth it. We went back to see \"L'inferno nelle grotte\" ( hell in the cave ) which was a night show based on Dante's inferno. Do not miss this either, it was a terrific show",
          "We turned up to the Grotte and booked a tour (1.5 hours, easy walking). The tour guide realised that the majority of the group (only 15 or of us) were English speaking, and so happily switched between English and Italian. She told us that during the summer, that get so many",
          "The white stalactites, stalagmites and curtains of Castellana Grotto were spectacular. If you speak Italian, there is a 1.5 hour tour. if you speak English, check their website or ask at the ticket box when the English tours (1 hour) occur. Either way, even without the",
          "The caves were absolutely magnificent. Shame we couldn't take pictures inside the deeper caves. Amazing all the same. The guide was great giving us a lots of information.",
          "What a huge cave and underground formation. Be careful when going down, the stairs is slippery, but you will have a magnificent view when you reach the bottom of the long stairs. The light which shines in from the top hole of the cave gives the stone walls and stone formations",
          "The caves are incredible. The tour lasts about half an hour. There is enough lighting to help you navigate but it is slippery down there so be careful.",
          "This is well worth seeing. the guide was knowledgeable and pointed out some interesting formations or colours that gave a part of the cavern its nickname. It really is worth taking the long route because the final cavern is the best example I have seen of these types of rock",
          "Any photograph will not do these caves justice. Take the long route, because the last cave is by far the most extraordinary and it is not that far and not that difficult a walk, and there is a lot of stopping so there is plenty of time to rest if need be. It is not",
          "We really enjoyed the long tour around the caverns that included all the top highlights in the cavern. Sadly, we do not speak Italian, and the long tour guiding was available only in Italian. If you like natural wonders, do not miss this one. We arrived early and only had to",
          "This place is really a bit of a gem for anyone touring around Puglia. Only miss out if you are a bit claustrophobic. Otherwise take the tour, enjoy the information given by our guide and marvel at the sheer \"grandeur\" of this place.Well worth the entry fee!",
          "We took the long (2 hour) tour with an English speaking guide. The white room at the end of the walk is well worth a visit. Fantastic. I would not recommend to go during the high season. Too crowded.",
          "We took the FSE train to Grotte di Castellana, remembering to alight at Grotte di Castellana, the second station rather than in the town of Castellana di Grotte. The latter would have required a long walk or additional transport. The FSE train in Bari Centrale is boarded by",
          "Went there with my 6 years old son for the short one hour trip. The cave is look amazing and the guides are very professional and shared a lot of interesting knowledge about the cave. You don't need any special equipment or clothes for visit because everything is very well",
          "If you are passionate about nature, it is worth seeing the largest cave system in Italy, especially as the first one has a natural opening, it is like a natural pantheon. The long English guided tour might be a bit boring sometimes, but at the end you get to see the White cave,",
          "My wife and I did the full trip with English language guide. Was good if not a little boring after a while, the White Cave at the end was somewhat of an anticlimax after all the build up. Otherwise was a pretty good trip",
          "Despite being keen to enjoy the tour, I was entirely underwhelmed. Puglia has just so much to offer that this sight pales into insignificance especially compared to other Karst caves in say Lebanon or Slovenia. The tour was professional enough, access easy and minimal queuing.",
          "I read mixed reviews on this cave and almost wondered if we should skip it. Now I can\u2019t even imagine why anyone would suggest not going here. This is absolutely - breathtakingly - beautiful. I\u2019ve seen caves all over the world, and hands-down this is my favorite. By all means",
          "We had shorter visit because it was already 6 p.m. It was very nice guided tour. if you are near by, be sure to visit.",
          "We have been in several caves all over the world, but we were gobsmacked by the beauty of the Castellana caves. The white cave especially was a surprise. The English tour was good and we heard a lot of information. It is well worth visiting these caves!",
          "I haven't visited caves as large as these before so I was impressed and pleased that we visited. If you want a tour in English, it is worth finding out before you go the times of these. Think the long tours in English are generally 11am and 4pm. Our group was a good size - about",
          "First time I visited the caves it was about 50 years ago as a school excursion. I took the time to bring my family there and to watch the caves. I would suggest to take the longer trip, as they offer a short one and a longer one. Inside it s forbidden to take pictures, and if",
          "The Good: - The tours are offered in multiple languages - The tours are often en waiting is not too long - The cave is relatively interesting, large rooms - Your 3 year old can do the tour - If this is your first big cave, it is allright. - If the weather is bad, this should",
          "If you have visited other karst caves, this one is very similar and perhaps you can skip it, especially if you are pressed for time. The caves can be reached by train from Bari, however the trip takes 1 hour and 20 minutes for 35 km! You can only visit on a guided tour. The",
          "Did the hour Cave tour. Was spectacular and interesting... Kids loved it.. Lift out of cave so not too strenuous for the kids.",
          "It was like fairy tale. I felt myself like Indiana Jones- searching treasures in the caves. Grotte di Castellana is one of the must see things in the Puglia.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing. The guide was good even if she was too fast in my opinion. It got easily crowded with all the tourists, but would still recommend to go and take the long tour. The almost 2 hrs felt like 20 min.",
          "I have been on a few cavern tours in my time, but this one takes the biscuit! We only did the short tour (due to too much groaning from accompanying teenagers about the prospect of anything longer), but I'd have taken the longer tour if possible. Yes, there are stalagtites and",
          "Beautiful caves....well worth a visit. I suggest to do the complete visit just to see the magnificent White Cave.",
          "To be fair we only had to stand for 15 mins or so to get our tickets. We opted gor the english 'full' tour at 11am. It is true that it can look chaotic when you are by the ticket/ entry doors...but go with the flow....this is Italy and things are done diffrently. Below ground it",
          "Great day visiting this impressive Karst cave system. The English language tour was at 4pm. The guide described the caves and how they were formed well.",
          "I mention the English tour, specifically, because it had the smallest group. The tour in Italian had more than 50 people in it. If you're there anyway, the full tour is worth it as the final cave (the \"White Cave\") is spectacular and different from what you'll have seen along",
          "You have to queue twice! One to buy the entrance ticket, the second time to enter the grotte. We queued twice 30 minutes!!",
          "Huge caves I have been so far! It\u2019s a well done tour guided an takes around 2 hours! It is worth to visit! Our guide was also very nice and funny. Tour might be hard for mums with very small kids.",
          "Fabulous trip in stunning caves. Our 2 boys enjoyed it too, but the short tour was enough for them. well worth a visit",
          "Caves are a must see. Our tour guide Daniella was very interesting and even my teenage children found the caves fun. What a surprise! Do the complete tour because otherwise you miss the best parts.",
          "There is no doubt that the caves here are incredible, and it is definitely a spectacle. The tour was fairly informative, and available in English. We were also the only people in the group as we went early, so it was done at our pace. However, it was quite expensive at 44 Euros",
          "We visited the Grotte on a hot afternoon - we thought it would provide a welcome contrast to the ongoing glorious seaside days of Puglia (another review....). We went for the short visit because of the kids - and we were all blown away by the beauty of the place. It really is",
          "These caves are really well worth a visit - especially in summer when they are cool. Unfortunately we missed the longer trip so could only do the shorter guided tour - but it was fine. Sometimes it is difficult to hear the guide as the groups are quite large but nothing detracts",
          "You must go to this Grotte, It is truly mind boggling! I could not have imagined such a magnificent place. Stunning to walk through. Don't miss this!",
          "Make the time to explore, ideally on the long route as the white cave is lovely. Make sure you book a slot with the right language guide.",
          "I arrived to the caves shortly before 4PM, when the long tour started and was afraid I wouldn't be able to buy the ticket as the line of people was very long. Luckily it appeared that the whole group was split between four groups -the biggest was in Italian, then in French,",
          "We visited the Grotte and had a great time. We took the longer 2 hour tour and saw the beautiful caves all the way through to the stunning white cave.",
          "We went here on a Wednesday morning around 11 AM, so you wouldn\u2019t think it would be super busy, but it was! There were tours in many different languages, which is awesome, however the groups are quite large and it was hard to hear our guide most of the time; also, there are",
          "Amazing journey. I recommend it strongly for everyone to visit the cave. I'm sure that you will not regret it.",
          "A really bad experience, staff are rude, they even don\u2019t speak any other language than Italian. 3km of tourists queue. All seems like to be about money. They even don\u2019t want we take any photos. 58\u20ac for 2 adults and 2 kids Shame on you you ruins my day !",
          "You can choose to do the 3km or the 1km tour through the caves but the 3km in English doesn't start until 4 p.m. which was too long a wait. However the 1km tour was excellent. Great guide with very detailed description of each cave, which ranged from enormous aircraft hanger",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful place to be. We all enjoyed this experience. It has a beautiful history. Kudos to Prof Franco",
          "One of the highlights of visiting Bari would be to see the caves. But to make it spectacular and wonderful would mean having a great guide which unfortunitly we didnt. The cave is really beautiful but the walk was very short considering you walk in a circle and the fact you",
          "This was a very spectacular 3km walk underground. There was a 1km option but the 'White Cave' is on the longer route. The guides were very informative and did the best they could but my critique is the groups were too large and not sorted into seperate languages well enough. The",
          "The caves are amazing and really are worth seeing. Do try and book the long tour as the caves further along are even better. Here are a few useful bits of information: 1) It's cool and humid in the caves and so dress appropriately. 2) Watch your head - there are lots of low",
          "Guided tours are available in English, German, French, and of course in Italian. You may want to wear a light jacket since the cave temperature is a constant 60-64 deg. F. You will see beautiful natural formations of stalactites and stalagmites, and interesting shapes, and",
          "We missed the English tour so took the Italian tour instead our 2nd guide explained things along the way. Thanks to Mara Whole tour is amazing 3km in total, beauty you can\u2019t capture on camera Beautiful trip and now on to Altamura",

          "I have never visited caves/grottos like this before, so we found it quite amazing. We did the short tour, which was more than sufficient, and gives you a good sense of the cave system, the history, the geology of the grotto, and there is certainly plenty to see (note you can\u2019t",
          "Fascinating experience, especially if you are able to take the longer tour to the last alabaster cave. Probably less exciting and dramatic if you only do the shorter one. The short tour which takes about an hour goes about half way into the series of caves. While interesting,",
          "Interesting caves though they are in no way exceptional ..not a patch on, say, the 4 caverns at Castleton in Derbyshire (UK) or the Salt mines in Cracow. Such a shame that some of the stalactites have been damaged by vandals, nevertheless there are many fine examples and it was",
          "Came all way from other side of Italy with my 2.5 years old daughter to visit the caves. I was a bit late and caves were closed but the guide was still there. Caves were reopned for us and a tour was done-very professional, fabtastic, extraordinary but most importantly the",
          "Personally, I was surprised with the number of excellent reviews this sight has received. We have visited caverns around the world, and found this particular one underwhelming. First, the guide was bored which made the tour boring. Secondly, other than the height of the \u201crooms\u201d,",

          "The Grotte in Castellana is an extraordinary cave complex and one of the most amazing natural wonders of the world. Many years of explorations uncovered a system of caves 3 km length and 73 m in depth. There are two possible tours for visitors: the shorter one of 1 km (one hour)",

          "Well worth the visit and a great explore of caves and underground formations. Plenty has already been written but I\u2019ll just add that if you are in Bari, jump on the train from platform 11 and make your way out and make sure you get off at Grotte di Castellana not Castellana",
          "This was one of my favourite experiences in Puglia. These caves are absolutely breathtaking. The formations are so impressive that they almost don\u2019t look real - I felt like I was on a movie set in places. The entire site is extremely well maintained and the 3 km walk is not at",
          "Well worth a visit,Quiet extraordinary place to see. Its 3 kms long, but does not see so. An English speaking guide led us through. The various formations are incredible, as are the beautiful colours",

          "We went there in offseason (February), the tour was only in Italian (my Italian is limited to Ciao and arrivederci), there were like some only 4 more visitors. Despite that, it was truly nice attraction. We've been to Postojna, and I must say, I liked Grotte di Castellana much",

          "A trip to the grotto came highly recommended. The low-down on this tourist attraction is that it really is worth spending some your travel budget in a bit of a Middle Earth experience. Our guide was very interested in her environment and it showed in her commentary. You climb",

          "Well worth a visit while in the area. I did it with my 13yr old twins. It cost me \u20ac40 which I thought was expensive. Opted for 3km tour which was to be 2hrs. The information was weak from the guide. There was little regarding formation of stalactites or stalagmites. Nothing",

          "I did the long English tour with my wife. The caves are impressive and a must do in this part of Italy. I can understand why photographs are only allowed in the first cave - if everyone stopped to take a picture at every stunning feature the tour would take 5 hours rather than 2",
          "Chose to visit the caves on our cruise stop in Bari and we were quite impressed! This is the largest cave we had visited thus far in our travels. Being inside will make you feel tiny. Lots of large stalagmites and stalactites, including some in fun shapes which were pointed out",
          "I visited the Grotte di Castellana yesterday with my two teenage sons. Outside, it's all very Disneyland, with lots of stalls selling overpriced tourist tat, and a number of caf\u00e9s and restaurants. A special shout out for the toilets: there are stairs down for the ladies, and",
          "These caves are just stunning! Absolutely amazing. Bit tricky if you are not fit and agile because of steps, slippery floors but so worth it if you are. Cannot imagine how all this has been created by nature. Our tour guide for the English full tour was excellent. The only thing",
          "Just took the short tour as the next English guide was not until 16:30 Quite a lot of steps down but once there, it was a laid path with non slip matting on the slopey bits. Stunning inside. For some obscure reason photography is not allowed except in the first cave. The is",

          "Didn't bother with any of the tips we had read on tripadvisor- mainly as we aren't well organised enough! Didn't book in advance,- no problem getting a ticket, parked on the road- didn't get a parking ticket! Don't use the toilet- you have to pay- in any case you are about to",
          "Today I took the long English language tour of the Grotte di Castellana. It was great. We had a much smaller group than the Italian groups did. Laura, our guide, was enthusiastic about the wonder, history, and geology of the caves. She had a fun sense of humor and light",
          "I don't claim to be particularly \"into caves\" but this one is certainly worth a visit. I have been twice but only done the shorter tour which I would guess would be fine for most people. The tour guide was sweet and had a cheesy line of patter. Do take a light jumper even in",

          "We visited the Grotte with a 3.5 and 8 year old. We arrived around 10am, and took the short tour (in Italian). This was certainly enough for the 3.5 year old. Our 8 year old could have managed the long tour easily. The tour guide was genuinely positive and complementary of the",
          "An amazing natural creation formed over millions of year. It was not the first time I have visited but after many years I had forgotten how awesome this cave system is. One of the jaw-dropping facts I learnt today is that the average stalactite takes 50-60 years to grow 1 cubic",
          "Loved the caves! It is rare when they allow you to go deeper in the cave and see different formations. It is about an hour tour with a humorous guide (at least ours was :)). Great for the kids and adults, and also perfect to get away from the heat outside. And it includes",
          "Really was a great cave. Our English guide was amazing lots of information. We were in a group of about 30, but they were putting groups in of about 100 which meant for lots of queuing in the caves for these larger groups. Book tickets online and go straight into the departure",
          "Clearly the caves themselves are magnificent, however trying to see them at any less than 48 hours notice in high season will prove hopeless. We tried to book online the day before our planned visit but this was 'not possible', unless booking 30 (?) hours before your chosen",
          "beautiful in every period of the year, this wonderful place offers the extra value of 2 h escape from the summer heat. dont be lazy and go for the complete tour including the white cave! you want to hope to get a friendly guide though or you might feel again like a little kid",

          "We visited the grotto today. It came highly recommended. We were impressed by the size and beauty. Unfortunately we did not realize that the tours are mandatory and are either 1 or 2 hours. Each tour leaves by the hour. If you want the 1 hour tour check the schedule in advance.",
          "How many caves does one get to see in a lifetime? This is big, and is a project of the city of Castellano, which owns it. Great way to be in an extensive cave system. That the guides are passionate about their work is great. I find paying for a bathroom outside of the facility",
          "Well worth a visit. The height and different areas within the caves and the vastness at different points are amazing. The guides were very informative.",
          "Good organisation, very beautifull!! Pity that taking photo's inside the caves is not allowed. Recommended!!",
          "Very beautiful but the 3km tour was a bit too long, but if you want to reach the most beautiful part (white caves) you have to pick this one. English was very good!",
          "Very nice to escape a hot day. The tour guides are friendly as they passionatly speak about the caves.",
          "We were very impressed with the amazing cave systems. It's been very well set out and the lighting is excellent. My only complaint is that nowhere did I see signs that we couldn't take photos inside the caves but once we were in there we were trailed around by a couple of",
          "Because it rained, we looked for something to do and found this. Great caves, great experience. We took the short tour because we had a child, but awesome nevertheless.",
          "By far the most impressive cave complex we ever visited. Well organised. English tours at 11 and 16h. Not that cold inside: sweater is mor than enough. You don't need very sportive shoes: just make sure you have a pair that is non slippery. Take the complete tour or you miss the",
          "It is 18 degrees in the cave, so no need to wrap up. Sensible footwear advisable as the floor is slippery in parts. Not recommended for people with walking difficulties or claustrophobia, but it is a worthwhile tour. The formations are magnificent and you will be in awe when",
          "we have visited several cave systems in France and Switzerland we were somewhat disappointed by this one.. They were not very busy but manage to schedule all of the visits at the same time which leads to lots of waiting ... for mediocre caves.. The white cave at the end was",
          "Enjoyed the tour of the caverns, as it was a bit different from the usual tourist atractions, and very interesting. Took the full tour with the English speaking guide, which made it more real for us. The long tour takes 2 hours and requires people to be reasonably fit, due to",
          "Visited here last week with my partner. I had booked tickets in advance in England prior to our visit (as they only do the two hour English tours twice each day - one at 11am and the other at 4pm and we would only had the morning free to visit). We did not park in the car park",
          "For anyone in the Puglia region this is a must see attraction. Although a reasonable level of fitness is required to take the full 2 hour tour through all the caves, it is well worth the effort to reach the final White Cave, which is truly beautiful.",
          "The first cave would have done for me. The initial queues to get in are off putting. I can understand preserving the caves but it is full of contradictions paving stones, lighting lifts. Seen one cave stalagmite and stalactite seen them all just variations on a theme. Not for",
          "I enjoy visiting caves and took the 2 hour tour of these ones. The highlight is definitely the beautiful white cave at the end of the tour. This in itself is worth a visit. One thing that both amused and annoyed me was the insistence of the guide that you could only take",
          "I have read some past reviews and there were a few comments re the English tour and prior reservations. We did not reserve the 11 a.m. 3 hour tour. We just turned up and paid. Maybe in high season it would make sense to enquire first. I must admit that I was surprised that",
          "Caves are beautiful, especially the White Cave. I recommend walking the long route, otherwise you will miss out. However, of you have difficulties walking or breathing issues, this excursion is not for you.",
          "We took the 11am tour which was in English, there is also one later in the afternoon. Although they say you can't take photos you can in the first cave. It's not that cold in there and although they suggest you wear sensible shoes I had my Birkenstock toe posts on and was fine.",
          "we did the 3km 2 hour trip, this has quite a bit of walking but easy to do, tour guides really informative and well worth the visit you can only take pictures in the first main cave though, which didnt make sense to me as there was artifical lighting all over",
          "The caves are well worth the time, and inexpensive. Guide spoke excellent English and was very informative. It is one of the largest I have been in. Highly recommend the 2 hour tour.",
          "Well worth the cost of admission we took the long tour in English that lasted two hours. The caverns are huge and the links between them are colourfully lit so you shouldn't get any sense of claustrophobia. It's very humid so expect to sweat a little and have some damp clothes",
          "We caught the FSE train from Bari to Castenella Grotte and walked about 2km to the Grotte di Castenella site. Be sure to check the website for available tour times and languages as it is different for different months. We chose the short tour and had a very knowledgeable",
          "took the long tour and enjoyed it. Times of tour depends on month of the year you visit and only certain ones are available in English.",
          "This is a World Heritage Site so if you are in the area I would recommend that you visit! We had a choice of two tours: one was 1 km long and the other 3 km. My husband is 72 and I am 67 - both fairly mobile. It would be a difficult hike for anyone with a mobility issue.",
          "a very relaxing walking underground, this is a place you will never forget. You can have the short or the long walking. I took the short one but it was enough to put this place in a high position in my top list. the routes are very clear, clean and with very good light so you",
          "It worths the visit. It is the most exceptional site underground I have ever seen. It is really marvellous. We couldn't take photos to preserve the site.",
          "An amazing cave, really nice experience. No special equipment needed because it is excellently worked out, Nice tour inside. Be prepared for a cave-temprature, especially in summer. Taking photos is forbidden. Tip: choose the long tour, otherwise you'll loose the most",
          "Tired of seeing the same trulli and olive trees? This is a nice place to visit if you're looking for something different in Puglia. The full tour to the white cave and back took us around 1.5 - 2 hours. We went with 3 young children, and they walked the whole time. But they",
          "I really enjoyed our visit. The caves are super impressive and some rooms are just fantastic. The guided tour was nice, he tried to speak French... Well, the guide was very nice but comments weren't very technical. I would have liked more. I highly recommend this visit, it's",
          "Who said paradise is in Heaven above the blue sky? This caves are a geological sparkling spectacle in the darkness of the ground. Loved them!",
          "We took the train from Alberobello this morning and arrived in Castellano in time for the long - 3 kilometres - tour conducted in Italian. Apparently English tours (for groups) have to be reserved in advance at this time of the year. I asked 2 questions of the guide in English",
          "Somewhat out of the way but still accessible by train from Bari Centrale. The ticket for the visit is somewhat hefty - 15 Euros, for a 90 minute tour. But the guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. If you have been to other complexes of caves, such as Betherram in the",
          "It is an amazing experience if you choose to go thru the longer visit that will last about 2 hours. You will walk 3 km and you will see first the entry cave about 60 m high, 50 m large and 100 m lenght, then many stalactites, stalagmites, fossils, canyons with names like \"Milan",
          "We visit the Grotte of Castellana during our holiday in Puglia organized by Arrivederci Puglia Travel....it was an unforgettable experience!",
          "A must-see place. The best cave of the world. Just book a plane and go there. It feels like being in a movie. Don't bring small children with you it is too hard for them.",
          "I visited \"le grotte\" as a child and went back as an adult. WOW! They are more beautiful than I remember...worth the drive and the entrance fee.",
          "We got the train from Bari to Grotte di Castellana. There we've founded an english amnd french guide who was very lovely. Grotte di Castellana is having a 1 km section and a 3 km section. You are entering through it and at the end you are getting out with an elevator, or you",
          "Going to caves is fun filled for non italian speakers, choose your time for 4 hours tour. If going by bus please take a mental note of the bus stop on way back. Siesta everything is closed and on holidays bus schedule is erratic and no one is sure about it. Eating place is",
          "There is a short about 1 km walk and the longer 3 km walk. Take the longer one and marvel at the stalactites and stalagmites about 2 hours The tour guides are most informative on the English tour. Surrounding the cave centre are shops and restaurants so enjoy a full day out.",
          "A good and comfortable walk at 70 meters below through beautiful stalactites and stalagmites ending up in the white cave, a wonder of natures. Worm clothes and anti slippery shoes are advisable, but don't overestimate the cold in winter. After a few minutes most people feel",
          "The Grotte was not initially on our itinerary but came highly recommended by our Puglia tour guide. I'm glad we obliged. What a majestic site. The two hour tour offered us access to all the levels in the grotto with the help of a guide. Photos are only permissible in the first",
          "I have visited many caves on my travels, in Italy, Slovenia, the Caribbean, Lebanon and China. This was a special experience. It was as spectacular as any but some way more intimate than any that I have seen. The 1.5 kilometer walk to the end at times was carved into the small",
          "I didn't even know this place existed & I'm so glad my husband used Tripadvisor to find it! We went on a wet Oct day which was a good call as its a constant temperature instead - be sure to take a light jacket or fleece! We took our 18 month old daughter, no buggies are",
          "We had no expectations of our visit, but were blown away by the caves, their beauty and majesty. The first cave was spectacular with an opening to the sky, and the other caves had the most amazing display of stalactites and stalacmites, of all sizes. Our guide in particular,",
          "The visit to the speleological system of the Grotte di Castellana, discovered by Franco Anelli on 23 January 1938 and subsequently explored along with Vito Matarrese, unfolds along two itineraries offering a myriad of spectacular concretions, stalactites, stalagmites, curtains",
          "Worth the visit. We took the small visit (about 50min) and paid about 10euro per person. The cave is very big with many things to see! Stalagmites, stalactites and even a dinosaur tooth!!!!WOW! The guide said that they have explored 2000 caves and since there are 2 other caves",
          "This cave tour is amongst the best we have been on. The display of limestone cave features was extensive and truly beautiful. We did the full tour which was well worth the extra walking( 3km in total) as the final cavern, the white cave was the best of all. It does require a",
          "This was fantastic. It's a long trek but well worth it. Our guide spoke very good English and had a great sense of humour. The rock formations and colours are amazing.",
          "A fantastic way to pass two hours in the south of Italy. I have visited the caves at Castellana many times, in different seasons and everytime I'm left with the same feeling. They are just so beautiful and the tour guides get better and better at helping the visitors see new",
          "Unfortunately we arrived at this attraction just prior to a guided tour (which is mandatory) that included an Italian speaking guide. The English speaking guided tour was later at an inconvenient time for our tour group. The grotto is very interesting and luckily joining our",
          "The full tour is incredibly impressive - I have been to quite a few caves and this one is definitely up there in regards to size and impressiveness. Only downer for us was that we couldnt get on an english tour - the wait was just too long so we decided to join an italian one",
          "My partner had not been in a large cave system like this before and was a bit hesitant, but we both enjoyed the excellent tour. The floor is reasonably smooth, although obviously not handicaped-accessible and the grade changes are not excessive. One relief is the lift at the end",
          "My wife is claustrophobic and uses, in my opinion, far too many words when she is issuing her daily edicts and commands. However, as she is totally scared of the dark and mice, amongst other things, I found that these caves were great for a day out ! Not only was she quiet for",
          "We are one the way to Rome from Alberobello by car and we stumbled to this cave!! The English tour guide was luckily starting in 10 minutes, so we desired to join!! It was two hour s of cave adventure with slippery ground. But it was incredible and amazing!! It is worth the stop",
          "Having visited many caves around the worold we were not expecting to be awestruck here but we most certainly were. It's a series of interconnected caves of varying sizes over a 1.5 kilometer walk. The first cave you enter is enormous with light pouring in through a small opening",
          "As part of a coach party my wife & I enjoyed the trip down the Grotte di Castellan. The guides english was very good. We took the short route that proved OK for a couple of people using walking sticks. ( The long section route may also be suitable for people with sticks. ) If we",
          "This is unmissable. I've seen many cave systems in my various travels, but the Grotte di Castellana beats them all. Magical and mindblowing. I had no idea there were stalactites shaped like corn on the cob, or like stems with thorns sticking out. The full tour takes almost 2",
          "It lies on 1.5 km length. It it the most beautiful system of caves probably in the world. It consists in 4 caves each having a name, each being more beautiful than the other. The most beautiful is at the end \"the white cave\". There is a long passage (500 m) resembling \"the Siq\"",
          "One of the best cave systems I have been to and full of great features. Fantastic stalactites and stalagmites and the beautiful whole cave at the end of the longer tour. Parking is not so simple but worth the money. Go on the 11.00 tour for English guide",
          "You have a choice of two routes - short and long. Short route is not effective if you have the time. Long trail is a really good choice - you'll see much more. Shooting in the cave is forbidden - allowed only in the first dome. White Cave at the end of the route is beautiful,",
          "The grotte di Castellana is very interesting and is beautifully lit - especially the white cave. I have to subtract 2 points though because a) you are not allowed to take photos in most parts of the grotte - I would have been willing to pay extra for taking photos, but the guide",
          "Great place to visit, keep in mind it can be a stiff walk underground but it is really worth it. After the 1st chamber it is forbidden to take photo's, for obvious reasons, the flashes would be very disturbing. It can also get very busy.",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours especially if the weather's not so great (as it was when we went). Took the longer 2 hour walk (remember, it's really one and a half hours because the last half hour of it is walking back through the caves to the entrance). Did the Italian",
          "These caves were amazing and knock the socks off Wookey hole! The full English tour of 2 hours is at 11am and worth doing for the final white cave,. An experience not to be missed.",
          "We visited with a 5 year old and took the long English tour. She had a ball - it was a long walk but if you child has reasonable stamina should be fine. Would definitely recommend appropriate footwear and a jacket for all.",
          "Great rainy day activity. 2.5km of caves and a guided tour (various languages) explaining the history and geology. A good family day out.",
          "If you pick the right tour then this is a wonderful visit. English tours are limited, especially the full one...aim for the late morning, currently 11am. Arrive at 09:30, buy your tickets and go have some breakfast in one of the local caf\u00e9s. The 2 hour tour is a long walk!!!!",
          "Very breath taking caves in the middle of Puglia. Take the long tour which brings you to the end and finishes in this amazing alabaster like cavern. Wear good shoes. The tour guides are excellent.",
          "Loved the caves! Amazing & varied structures through out. Wow is all I can say!! Check the times if the tours before you arrive. Take the 2 hour trip ( vs the shorter 50 min option ) through the cave network & bring comfy shoes with a grip. It's an amazing trip - it feels",
          "This was a great tour - the caves are really stunning - you need to do the longer tour tho to see the white cave at the end which is like an ice queens palace !",
          "We drove all the way from Francavilla and it was worth it! As i had only looked at a few pics online i was unsure what to expect. But it exceeded any expectations and was a fantastic experience. The guide spoke very good english and provided a nice tour (It could of course",
          "Worth a visit but the stories told by the guide are tourist-oriented and focused more on details than the full story of natural beauty of the caves, the resemblance of certain stalactites and stalagmites with objects, animals or saints is not exactly what we came for, but the",
          "You should try to visit the Caves when there are not too many tourists around because it is a little stressful to go to the caves with too many people. The caves are amazing and I would suggest to do the complete tour because the white room is one of the most special of Italy.",
          "A very interesting cavern the English tour was interesting the guide was very interesting and informative. Quite a long walk I would recommend the longer tour rather than the shorter one",
          "The caves are huge. If you like this type of sightseeing it's really worth it. The entrance is quite costly, 20 euros but it takes an hour and a half to do the tour.",
          "I think are the most beatiful in front to others similar in Italy A rich experience! Very interesting also for the childrens",
          "The scale of these caverns just has to be experienced to be believed, take the full tour, it takes 2 hrs and covers 1.5km underground (plus 1.5k return) and the huge chambers, number of stalagmites and stalactites, the beauty is fascinating; just when you think you've seen it",
          "We did the long tour that almost took two hours, in Italian so we didn't understand a word, but still enjoyed it. Even though we carried our 2 year old daughter the whole time. The sorter tour wouldhave been a better choice, but this was the only one available... Nature at its",
          "Had a great tour!! We had only time for the short tour of 1 hour, because it took a long time before the 2 hours tour started again.",
          "This is worth the trip!! I've been in caves before in the US when I was a teenager. So it had been a while. But it is still amazing. Great way to get out of the heat and do something worth while.",
          "well worth the visit, definitely do the long tour. we arrived just before the English tour which was pure luck, worth checking the times before arriving. wouldn't wish to visit at peak times as got very busy and congested allowing for other language tours to pass by and queue up",
          "We did the short English tour due to having low expectations and not wanting to get stuck with a long 3 kilometers tour. However, after getting down the steps, we quickly realized we should have done the long tour. The place is simply amazing. The kids loved it and our English",
          "Huge caves, amazing place. A shame for the guide Serena that wasn't knowlegeable at all and seemed a bit fed up with the people in general.",
          "Went down with limited expectations, but the long tour was worth the effort. Amazing formations and the white cave was stunning.",
          "If you want a tour in English, check out the times before you get there, as we were only able to get on a tour in Italian (or would have had to wait about 4 hours!) Also would recommend the longer tour, as the best formations are towards the end of the trail - well worth the",
          "it was amazing we went on a day trip and found these amazing caves. I have seen many around the world but these were by far the most people friendly and what a great structure. Just do it!!",
          "A very good cave system with some great stalagmites and stalactites. Our guide spoke very good English. We took the 11:00 English tour and so did a lot of school kids. Very packed inside and noisy. Walking out, we had to wait a long time for other groups coming in. Be",
          "We were blown away by the caves - what an amazing sight to see! We went on a hot day so the coolness inside was welcome and I actually needed a sweatshirt. Two of our group tend to be claustrophobic but had no issues here as most of the caves are quite large. As others state",
          "The cave is stunning and the views are incredible. The cave's length is about 3 km so it would take about 1,5 - 2 hours to finish the complete tour. There is also a smaller 50 minutes tour, but I would recommend taking the complete one.",
          "The this stalactite cave worth a trip.it's 1.5 km long the first 500 metres its wet stalactite the next 500 meters its dry stalactite and the last 500 meters you will see a beautiful surprising view",
          "We got onto an English tour at 11 am. The guide was knowledgeable, but rather curt. We took the longer route, walking 3 kms. The lighting was very good, enhancing the caves. Pity we could not photograph any part of this...I suppose they cannot trust visitors not to use their",
          "Today been to the cave..simply amazing .We took the 3km tour. (Long one )...and is simply amazing .worth every minut .The worst part is that they don't let you take pictures inside.even so. .I took some ;) and the ticket is 15 euro ..",
          "We had a great time, tour guide was very knowledgeable and while the walk is not challenging, it is long (underground....in a cave).... Our kids were worn out by the end as it is non-stop walking up and down stairs and slants and in and out of caves for 2 hours. I thought",
          "I'm not a fan of caves etc... and I thought that speding 15EUR to go down and see a cave was quite expensive. It rained... so we went inside. That's a 3km trip at 75m depth in a guided tour. The guide was a speleologist; she was passionated by her topic and shared a lot of",
          "Beautifull place, very nice people, close to beutifull Monopoly, Alberobello and Putignano...A lot of place to stay, the caroseno BB in Castellana is the best place to stay and the caroseno Osteria is without a doubt the best place to eat, do NOT miss them if you're in",
          "Impressive. 10 euros for 50 mins tour. There was also a much longer tour but frankly the short one (50 mins) will be long enough for most people. Lots of steps down but lift back up - yey!  Well worth the stop off.",
          "Good and informative guide Serena, spoke excellent English. Nature at its best. We visited many caves in the world, but this one stands out due to the naural light. Interesting formations. Short trip was just enough for us. Midday tour recommended to escape the heat. Trainers",
          "It definitively worth a visit! You can choose between the full visit (15\u20ac - 1.45h) and the short path (12\u20ac - 50min), the latter with no much sense since it misses the most interesting parts (such as \"Grotta Bianca\"). Remember you can have a 3-\u20ac discount showing IKEA FAMILY card.",
          "Took the short tour, mainly because of the timing, and it was great. The guide was not so engaged in her job, but besides that this was great. The walk is easy, I could easily carry our 4 months old baby in his Baby Bj\u00f6rn. The grottoes are huge and beautiful. It is just a short",
          "We never imagined that these caves will be so beautiful. Over 2 km long - simply amazing rock formations, stalagmites, stalactites and columns. The features took tens of thousands of years to form. Wear comfortable walking shoes as there is quite a walk. Caves are beautiful",
          "Quite a fascinating aray of caves and natural passageways with a mass of stalactites and stalagmites discovered only 76 years ago. The caves go to depths of almost 200 feet or more, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Pictures don't due justice to the beauty of these caves. The colors, the sheer magnitude of the site is something that has to been seen firsthand. I highly recommend a visit to the Grotte if you are in the area.",
          "castellana grotte is a beautiful, breath taking caves. they are under ground and have the feel past, with dancers leg,snake, pure white caves ......amazing place",
          "I had read about these caves before going to Italy. I was fascinated by the pictures, which I must say didn't do very justice to the actual experience. I went with my family as they had not been there either, even though they live close to the region. What can I say about these",
          "First time visiting. Amazing. It was over the christmas season so could see the nativity. Unfortunately caves were closed for the full tour. Would definitely visit again. Very friendly and helpful guides.",
          "It was the first time that I have every seen anything like is. It is a must se if you are visiting area, as its something that you are sure to remember. My visit was during Christmas so I was also able to see the nativity, which was amazing.",
          "The caves are very well tourist oriented. We had an English speaking guide which was excellent. For us it was strange to find a nice big caves in Puglia. Definitely wort a visit.",
          "We went there in family, with 4 kids under 10 and gave it a go. The set-up is simply magic and unbelievable. The tourist organization of the site is mature and while we were off season, I can imagine that the place can be really crowded in summer. The prices are not low but the",
          "If you've been to some of the larger caverns in the world, this one may not impress you but it is an interesting site. The tour is not the best...you will likely be herded into large groups that make hearing the guide virtually impossible. But the main attraction is the",
          "My wife and I have never been in a cave before and found the Grotte to be awe-inspiring in terms of the towering heights and incredible time-scale it The so-called \"White Cave\" (really a beeswax beige) is lovely indeed but was perhaps anticlimactic given the build-up of",
          "As per all the previous reviews, these caves are stunning and worth the effort. If you using the train, get down at grotte di castellana n not the other one..or you will hv to walk just about 2kms to get to the caves! Do the long walk..the white caves are definitely the",
          "At a constant 17 degrees C - 62 degrees F these caves are very cool! Breathtaking views and fun to be a spelunker explorer for the day. The tour at \u20ac15 p/p including guide is well worth the visit. The walk is approximately 3 kms long and takes approximately 1.5 hours. Guides",
          "As said our guide, this cave is a symphony of spells ... what we see here, sustains his breath. This is the queen of all caves, all are special but this one has a special story and catacter. Each part of this cave reflet the grandeur of a world unknown to us. Can not lose !!",

          "I imagine that it is less pleasant in the summer months when it is crowded... That is the only possible reason that I can come up with why anyone would give these caves less than full marks. Absolutely beautiful!! Yes, the floors are slippery in parts... it's a cave. A living,",
          "A very good cave system, awesome stalagmites and stalactites. Good guides who speak very good English. Just a shame we missed the full tour at 11.am and the next one was at 16.00 but the short tour was good enough. A lot of steps to get in and it is rather slippy in places, but",

          "I've been there twice (both long version) once in the Italian tour, the second time with the English tour, both were amazing experiences. The final white cave is the best part. The entry ticket is quite steep (adult 15 euro for the long tour as 2014) but consider that it took",

          "Really worth to pay 16EUR for 2 hour tour. It is allowed to make photos only in the first cave. Be prepared for a long queue to the ticket office...and toilet. If anyone thinks that will be alone during the tour, forget about it. It is a \u2026",
          "Impressive cave. The entrance (the first chamber) with the large gaping hole in the 60m high ceiling is also the main attraction of this cave. The cave itself is large and the tour is about 3km. There's a crystal lake and many nice formations. But nothing is as breathtaking as the first room. Worthy of a visit.",
          "5 star for the caves and 2 stars for the tour. Caves were endlessly amazing - so many weird formations, lots of variety, so long and endless stalactites. Unfortunately they start 4 tours at once with probably 200 people total. I couldn't hear our guide and wish she'd spoke louder.",
          "A large cave system with lots of features.  Get there we'll beforehand if you want the long tour  (and you do) as ticket queues are long.   There are no toilets once you are through the doors and it's a two hour tour!  Good option for a rainy day.",
          "The tour was great and it was an amazing experience to be able to visit these caves. The only downside was the guide who just spoke way too fast so we didn't really have to to understand and process everything that was being said. She also got angry at people for no reason.",
          "If you are into nature and love to use your imagination itana great stop to make. Make sure to check the hours of tours. Entrance is only available via guided tours. The caves are always 16/18 celcius; roads slippery. Dress accordingly.",
          "In my opinion, this is the largest and most beautiful cave in Italy and Europe.",
          "Amazing cave. Totally recomend.\nBut not allowed to take photos. Too fast moving, not enough time to explore, just go faster.",
          "Magic place with very good guided tours. Even during summertime, when the place is crowded with tourists, guides take time to provide visitors with insightful information. Be aware that you should wear long sleeves and pants in the summer too, as it is humid and might be chilly as you descend underground.",
          "This was very interesting and beautiful and well worth plucking up the nerve to do! It's very chilly and quite a bit of walking so would recommend taking a jumper and wearing walking shoes...",
          "Amazing caves, the short tour was amazing can only imagine what the rest of the cave system looks like since the tourist center said we would be missing the best parts on the short tour! Well worth the visit.",
          "Amazing caves. Really deep and long tour takes just under 2 hours... You are walking all the time with interesting commentary .\u20ac17 each",
          "We covered 3 km on this tour,  with an informative guide who obviously loved his job. Quite crowded in places, but this only meant that we had to stop and linger which was a great way to take the amazing scenery in. Queuing for tickets was \u2026",
          "Very impressive place. The guide tour is pretty informative. Safe for children. Would recommend for sure!",
          "Had the English tour. The caves are beautiful (though not the best  I've seen) but there can be so many people that the guided tour consists mainly of funnelling visitors from one cave to the next. A bit disappointing from that point of view. No picture can be taken inside the caves.",
          "Very beautiful. Although we had not realized that you must walk through with a guided tour. The group's can be big and noisy. But definitely worth the visit. Bring good walking shoes.",
          "The caves are impressive, the service depressing. 16 euros for the full tour with no discounts for students even when this is not a private owned site and 4 euro for the parking. Bathrooms are 50cent and the lady was very rude. Organization overall is a mess and should improve with the entrance price they ask!",
          "Spectacular stalagmites and stalactites.  A real wonderland",
          "I liked the tour. It was about an hour and half. The guide was friendly and answered all of our questions. If you are in the area, then it is worth visiting.",
          "Really big an beautiful cave. Worth a visit.",
          "Just very impressive. 4 stars because they will let you pay to go to the toilet even after paying entrance fee.",
          "Really good English tour. Purchase tickets online before hand other wise there is a large wait, but you can purchase at the place on the day.",
          "Not open, strange opening hours. Dissapointing!",
          "Really nice excursion. 2 type of excursion, short if 1 km and a long one of 3 km. Suitable also for kids. Suggest to bring cash, if the card is not working there is not atm around the area.",
          "Very big caves with lots of interesting features. The white cave at the end is well worth the walk.",
          "A nice hike, 2 hr walk to thr white cave, you can cut short after 50 min if you want, really majestic, worth the drive",
          "Grotta Bianca wonderfull. No photo allowed",
          "The caves are amazing, the lightning gives a good show. Too bad they didn't split the different language tours further apart so it was very crowded. Also it was forbidden to take photos because of the copyright, yeah right.",
          "Popular place, and well worth the extra for the long tour. Approximately 1.5km walk down to the last cave and 1.5km walk back. The final cave is just covered in stalactites, lots of little ones, and two enormous pillars. No photos allowed past the entrance cave.",
          "The tour was designated as 120 minute tour and ours felt rush and was finished within 1 hr and 20 minutes.  The cave is very interesting, however, we walked very quickly that I did not feel that I had enough time to fully enjoy it.  Due to \u2026",
          "Very interesting tour. But tour is better reserved beforehand.",
          "This is a must!! Astonishing views along 1,5 km deep walk in the cave. Need to check visits timetable.",
          "It was a very beautiful and interesting place. One should definitely do it once in a lifetime!",
          "Very cool place. Nice tour through amazing caves that are beautifully lighted.  Would definitely recommend a visit.",
          "Maybe the most visited place in puglia. A must see. No picture after 1st cave as apm are forbidden.",
          "Beautiful caves with impressive formations! Take the long tour or you will miss the stunning white grotto!\nSadly you are not allowed to take photos after the first chamber. \nAll in all a stunning place and well worth a visit!",
          "We booked a 2 hours guided tour and it was amazing.",
          "Beautiful and impressive. Nice tourguide but just a little bit info. Bring jackets and long pants because it is really cold!",
          "Amazing experience and by far the best caves I\u2019ve ever seen.",
          "Interesting place! Entrance to inferno danthe alighieri!",
          "Really beautiful. Must visit this cave.",
          "Totally worth it. Impressive caves. We did the 1h tour but I think it is recommended to do the 3h tour. Amazing every single corner. Recommended to bring a jacket it is cold inside 18 degrees.\nTry to book in advance. The tours has different timing depending on the language and the type(1h or 3h).",
          "Beautiful place, worth the money and the time. Get your ticket could take some time.",
          "No photography allowed inside. Only the entry / exit areas. Interesting & amazing nature. Must see.",
          "Best cave I've ever been to. Regards, Batman.",
          "A must visit if you come to see the cities nearby. \nYou want be disappointed :)",
          "A dream of a cave with extremely impressive structures and huuuge spaces! Full recommended!",
          "Getting tickets online was very difficult and requires a lot of information. It's easier to buy tickets at the register.",
          "Interesting caves, better to take long route visit to see whole cave opened for tourist visits.",
          "Nice speologic experience. Good guides",
          "It is beautiful place 3 km of jurney interesting and 16 euro for ticket ok, but inside can not use camera , phone you can only shoot enterence",
          "Nice caves but guide was not very inspiring. Even felt boring walking through the caves as you have to wait for other groups to continue their walk. You can't take pictures due to copyright. Which is a bit nonsense I believe. Also very touristic.",
          "I liked what we saw, but just as we arrived a terrific thunderstorm and torrential rain began so our trip was quite rightly abandoned and we returned back to the harbour",
          "Very pretty, but it gets quite muggy near the end. Also, make sure not to take expensive or hard to clean shoes since they'll get covered in clay.",
          "Great place.",
          "Absolutely excellent and worth a long drive to visit. An absolute must.",
          "The place was gorgeous but the guide spoke vert fast so we couldnt understand",
          "Impressive but surroundings not very lively, everything not open yet.",
          "Very impressive, and thanks to the staff members (Ramona and Sergio) i was able to visit the caves inspite of my disability.\nMany thanks for the possibility to book a private tour and their efforts and explanations.\nJeroen & R\u00e9gine",
          "beautiful and worth to see",
          "It is such a different \"underground world\" where you can see the power of nature \u00een creating interesting forms of art.",
          "Beautiful place, really worthly to visit. There are also tours for speaking english.",
          "Amazing caves and interesting guided tour.",
          "Great underground network of caves!",
          "Excellent experience. Take the short program  for an hour long underground walk. The standard is 2 hrs, but if you have issues with high humidity, think twice. There is a fixed calendar on the visitting, you should plan ahead.",
          "Absolutely amazing. Shame we couldn't take pictures. Only in the initial part of the caves. A fantastic morning exploring the caves. Simply magnificent.",
          "Amazing, fantastic, very nice and Imagineering cave in Italy",
          "Super interesting caves with a really nice tour guide. I\u2019m glad we did this tour - it was a cool experience and we learned a lot about the history of the region from deep underneath the ground!",
          "Wery nice",
          "Nice caves but the guide tour not so interesting. The girl that did the tour seems bored",
          "I did a random excursion here from Bari because my flight was delayed and it ended up being one of the highlights of my trip.  I did the long tour which was an hour and 45 minutes.  It was absolutely stunning and the guide was nice and \u2026",
          "Amazing sight but felt rushed on tour. Our tour guide a little deadpan. Though had heard others are more enthusiastic. Felt I had to look where I was walking constantly instead of looking around me and therefore couldn't take it in. Nice cool walk though",
          "Very interesting 2 hours excursion. Amazing, huge caves.",
          "Very nice \ud83d\ude0a",
          "You have to visit this beatiful cave",
          "Very well organised tour in a beautiful place...",
          "This is a wonder of the world, that no words can adequately describe. If you are traveling in the area, try to visit the Grotte, but make sure to take the long tour; the best amusements are on the second part of the walk.",
          "Very good please for curious kids",
          "Nice caves to visit. Regretfully there were only Italian tours available this part of the year (other seasons there might also be an English tour). However, halfway the guide found out that we were not speaking Italian and was even so friendly to do it also in English.",
          "Amazing caves. Really worth the price and effort.\n\nYou can buy tickets on the spot. 16 EUR per person, for a long trip (2018)\n\nNot that cold and not that long. I went in wearing shorts, running shoes and t-shirt with light jacket. I had to \u2026",
          "Wow, just wow! Amazing cave system. We did the full English tour which takes 2 hours and involves walking 3 km. The temperature is a comfortable 16-18 degrees inside, just wear a jumper. No need for a waterproof. A good idea to take some water.\nThe full tour is definitely worth it to see the white (alabaster) cave at the end.",
          "A great day out with family and friends, there are tour's of the caves in English ,German ,French and of course Italian. There are also two diffrent routes a short route taking up 50 minutes - an hour, or the longer route taking about 2 \u2026",
          "Delicious pizza and beer....",
          "Impressive caves. Nice walk inside the caves. Inside is warm and humid.",
          "Excellent experience. Too bad you can only take pictures in the first cave only, the others are spectacular too.",
          "Amazing place!!! Great surroundings!!! Is so worth to see!!!",
          "The caves themselves were stunning and unlike anything I've ever seen. The tour guide was funny and knowledgeable and tours are available in English. The few detractors from the experience are the surrounding area (it's a little sad \u2026",
          "Hell in the cave ... fantastic",
          "Very interesting place.  Worth the visit",
          "Lovely place great escape town",
          "It's very big, even you need to walk 2 hours with tour guide,you still love it.\nUnfortunately,you couldn't take too much picture inside.It's amazing and fantastic place.By the way the guides are very detailed and interneted.\nYou must to see in Italy.",
          "Nice, not more than that",
          "Top",
          "Wonderful place...but enquire about how far to walk if disabled. \nSeemed it was a continual walk...just looking at images in rocks..\nBut suppose that was it the beauty of it all.",
          "If you like natural caves you have to see them: 1 mile of visitable concretions, 230 feet below Earth. Photos are not allowed apart from the cave where the tour starts and ends.",
          "Excellent, but buy tickets in advance!  We arrived at 10:25 and queued until after 11:00 as only two ticket desks were quite inadequate for hundreds of people. But the window for advance ticket collection had no queue.   Plenty of people \u2026",
          "Totally worth the money. They offer guided tours in several languages. Our tourguide was super friendly. Take the long tour. I never  saw before such a huge cave. As of copyright and security reasons it is only allowed to make photos in the \u2026",
          "No entrance possible without guide. The guide's English wasn't always that understandable with the strong Italian accent. But such an amazing place.",
          "VERY NICE PLACE..But I feel a little bit naturality gone",
          "This was a very fun and interesting tour of something you don\u2019t get to see or experience everyday. \n\nThe kids enjoyed and learned something and remember it from the trip.",
          "Very unique caves, fun experience. Specific times for English speaking tours, so definitely check the schedule in advance. Lots of cute little shops and eateries just outside the grotte. Worth a visit to this area",
          "Check the website for your hours before going on a visit. There are only scheduled guided tours.",
          "Good trip worth the visit but check tour times in the language you want on the website.\nWalk down.\nLift up :)\nEasily doable from Alberobello on the train, when and if they run\ud83d\ude44\nNB not all the trains stop at .. Grotte di Castellana.. Station.",
          "Amazing place amazing tour. Great visit 70 meters below the surface! Spectacular!",
          "This is a wonderful place. We'll worth the visit. We'll-organized tours informative tour guides.",

          "Beautiful place",
          "We are here in March, so we are not appraised climate inside cave:-), anyways it's a verry nice place. We have long version in Italian language. We not understand any words :-), I thing if uare not miner or some cave engineer it doesnt mather.",
          "Interesting site to visit, friendly guided tour, we went for the half tour. Reasonable price and worth it. Plenty of souvenir shops, restaurants and friendly cats.",
          "A must see. Choose the long trip to get the best experience. \n(Use the official parking, \u20ac 3. First place that I\u2019ve seen eager \u2018parking police\u2019 care about how people park in Italy.)",
          "Awesome place, good tour.",
          "Very impacting. The only tip is: be careful where you walk and mind your step as it can be very slippery.",
          "Perfect visit in a beautiful place. The guide was really nice.",
          "Worth the visit if you are in the area, just inform your self upfront regarding guided tours as you can\u2019t visit the cave on your own",
          "Great experience..worth the stop",
          "Luogo very  very good",
          "Huge and very interesting cave system.  Well organised tours. Make sure you check their website for times of specific language tours.",
          "Loved the cave trek and atmosphere. Our guide was informative and considerate to all visitors, to point out & explain the interesting formations.  Good experience",
          "Beautiful caves. Totally worth the experience. We took the short tour, as the long one was too late for us. Such a pity, as it was amazing.",
          "As the longest cave system in Italy it was a great adventure into the depths of the world. It was quite cool down there so remember a light sweater, and bring good walking shoes, the floor can get slippery. The tour was well worth it, especially seeing the white cave. A truly amazing natural wonder.",
          "Queuing was around 1h and half , we decided to abandoned the queue",
          "One of the best places i have been too. Totally worth the ticket price for the tour. Photos are allowed only in the first cave. A must go place",
          "Impressive cave. Take the long tour, the best part is at the end. Tour Groups are quite large. Some stairs and slippery parts, but nothing dramatic.",
          "Yet another amazing Apulian natural gift: impossible to effectively describe the miracle of these caves...a must-go!",
          "I haven't seen anything like that before. Take the longer tour cause you can't miss the white cave.",
          "Beautiful cave system, but very crowded and you're NOT allowed to take pictures inside (due to \"copyright\", not even camera flashes) which is extremely unusual.",
          "Wowee amazing caves. Touch nothing and no photos. It's cold down there and slippy in places so dress properly. You need a guide and probably useful to learn some Italian before visiting (as with all Italy).",
          "Beautiful...Spectacular...very intriguing ...a lot of walking (1hr & 3hr tours)...damp...cool...they tell you you can't take pictures but a lot of people were sneaking them in without using flash...usually you have a lead guide and a follow up guide...recommended!!",
          "Absolutely spectacular.  Great escape from the sun and heat on a hot summer day",
          "Fantastic caves, particularly the White Cave which is considered one of the most beautiful caves in the world",

          "Fantastic and overwhelming",
          "Beautiful caves and very informative guides. Good restaurant just outside as well as souvenir shops.",
          "Lovely trip for a few hours. If you need an non Italian guided tour make sure you get your timing right for your language. You have to do a guided tour.",
          "Very beautiful cave. There are no words to describe the beauty of what nature creates when humans don't interfere. Get the full tour and you will not regret it. The caves are big enough not to get claustrophobic, so don't worry. Some tips - \u2026",
          "Beautiful cave formations, stunning stalactites and stalagmites.\nWould advice check online tour schedule, to make sure be on time for english language (or german, french).",

          "Really easy and fun tour.  Beautiful caves with lots of variation",

          "A must if you are visiting the Puglia region.",
          "Beautiful place 72 m in deep. Almost 3 hours to cross it that amazing cave. If you go Puglia, Italy, you must visit it!",
          "Great place, 3 km long underground. Unfortunately, it is not allowed to take photos inside the cave. It is very disappointing.",
          "Magical place, carrying millions of years of slow creation of pillars, curtains and fantastic animals.",
          "Awesome. This place is so unique, especially the first two domes are breathtaking. Glad I was here.",
          "Great experience!",
          "Fantastic. You descend into a cavernous underground space 70m down and then walk a kilometre underground through other chambers. Stalagmites and stalactites in abundance.",
          "Amazing place to visit. Did the short tour which was great.",
          "The caves were beautiful but I am leaving 3 stars because our guide was very arrogant. He also didn't have any sort of uniform to indicate that he was our guide..Our group was very large so it was difficult to keep everybody together. There \u2026",
          "It is gorgeous here. We went on the shorter tour because we had a toddler...the guides rushed us a bit, which was a little annoying, but I would highly recommend going anyway.",

          "Beautiful caves!",
          "Absolutely stunning. Take the tour to discover what's hidden in the heart of the cave.",
          "One of Nature's miracles. amazing stalactites and stalagmites of all size form and color. the cave is very well maintained and it is relatively easy to walk through it. Highly recommended",
          "Amazing caves and the inside is very interesting. Recommended.",
          "Amazing cave!! Take only the long tour! At the short one you won't get to the white cave, which is the most impressive  and unique (maybe even in the whole world). Really worth the money! You should check online when there is a tour and get enough time ahead in order to find parking and buy tickets.",
          "Impressive, I have visited grotto's in many countries, this one is in the top",
          "This is a fascinating cave system and very well set up for tours. You can only take photos in the first cave which is a shame because it would be lovely to try and capture the white cave, but this would also hold things up drastically I'm sure.\n\nIt is fun to see this planet look so alien and so gross!",
          "Magnificient",
          "Damn good, awesome cave  Great guide",
          "Great cave. Lots and lots of formations",
          "The caves were amazing. So glad I went. Don't skip this natural treasure! I did the long tour (3km) and it was easy walking and a nice reprieve from the summer heat. The reason I only give 4 stars is that the tours are too crowded, making \u2026",

          "Great place!",
          "Amazing cave,  very big and impressive. The tour is very interesting and is offered in different languages. If you have time, go to the long tour,  to see the white cave. The only drawback is the very long line.. We were waiting more than 40 minutes to buy tickets and only one ticket counter was open.. ",
          "Magical and fantastic experience.",
          "Fantastic! Do the long tour, you won't be disappointed.",
          "Well  worth a visit,  time  it to a language  you understand!",
          "Great tour, lighting in the cave was perfect. Would recommend. Shame you were not aloud to take photos after the 1st cave. There is quite a lot of steps and slopes to walk up and down.",
          "Take the elevator up; you'll be happier. Stupendous.",
          "Damage you can take photos from a certain point. They direct you to there website, but there are only a few photos available (you feel somewhat ..... )",
          "The caves are amazing but organization is really poor. Timetable of guided tours is available only at the cave entrance, which may be a problem considering a fact that full tour with english guide is only at 11 and 16. Would be really \u2026",
          "Amazing. Like nothing I've ever seen before.",
          "The long guided tour (2 hours) is better than the short one. There is less people in the morning. Buy your tickets online or arrive 20 minutes before the start of the guided tour.",
          "Good and wonderful cave. Not good place together with small kids. Guide tour is for apporx 2 hour.",

          "The last cave is impresive although the tour is way to simple and doesnt give any interesting information. Too long and too expensive for what it is.",
          "Well worth a visit. Do the long tour, but make sure you book your tickets ahead of time. Can be a little confusing on where to enter, it's basically where you buy tickets. You need to get you prefer purchased tickets validated at the information desk. If there are queues, they are for a different line, just walk past them.",
          "One of the biggest and wildest caves I have ever seen! But remember you're jacket, it can be a bit chilly down there ;)",
          "This place is unbelievable",

        "wiki": "Alberobello (Italian: [\u02ccalbero\u02c8b\u025bllo]; literally \"beautiful tree\"; Barese: Ajarubb\u00e9dde) is a small town and comune of the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. It has 10,735 inhabitants and is famous for its unique trullo buildings. The trulli of Alberobello have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1996.\n\n\n== History ==\nA first occupation of the area started only in the early sixteenth century on the impulse of the Count of Conversano Andrea Matteo III Acquaviva d'Aragona. He allowed about forty peasant families from Noci to settle here and cultivate the land, with the obligation to give him the tenth of the crops.\nIn 1635 his successor, Count Giangirolamo II (1600-1665) erected an inn with a tavern and an oratory and started the urbanization of the forest with the construction of few small houses. The expansion of the urban area was helped by the abundance of limestone, karst and calcareous sedimentary, and by the permission of the count to build houses only with dry walls without the use of mortar, which would become the peculiar trulli. This obligation to have houses built with dry stones was an expedient of the count to avoid paying taxes to the Spanish viceroy of the Kingdom of Naples. The centre of Alberobello was built on the streets of the ancient river Cana, where is now the largo Giuseppe Martelotta.\nAlberobello remained a fief of the Acquaviva of Aragon until May 27, 1797, when King Ferdinand IV of Bourbon elevated the small village to the royal city, freeing it from the feudal servitude of the counts. On 22 June 1797, the first mayor Francesco Giuseppe Lippolis was elected.\nAlberobello is the only inhabited center with an entire district of trulli. It is therefore considered the cultural capital of the trulli of the Valle d'Itria.\n\n\n== The Trulli of Alberobello ==\n\nThe history of the trulli is linked to the Prammatica De Baronibus, an edict of the 15th-century Kingdom of Naples that subjected every new settlement to a tribute. In 1481 the Counts of Conversano D'Acquaviva D'Aragona from 1481, owners of the territory of Alberobello, then imposed on the residents that they built their dwellings dry, without using mortars, so that they could be configured as precarious buildings and easily demolished.\nHaving to use only stones, the peasants found in the round form with self-supporting domed roof the simplest configuration. The roofs were embellished with decorative pinnacles representing the signature of the architect (master trullaro).\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nAlberobello is twinned with:\n\n Shirakawa-go, Japan\n Gokayama, Japan\n Monte Sant'Angelo, Italy, since 2013\n Andria, Italy\n Harran, Turkey, since 2013\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAlberobello.com\nAlberobello Tourism",

          "Lovely old houses (you think you're lost in a Hobbitt village) But avoid the area haunted by mass tourism. Just a few streets away there are much more genuine and charming places actually inhabited by real people, not souvenir shops. Not really worth staying the night there;",
          "The Trulli houses are very pretty and unusual. The streets are lined with shops and cafes.Some of these buildings allow you to go on the roof. It is a marvellous rooftop view across the town.. The interiors of the Trullis are small and you wonder how a family could squeeze",
          "This place is extremely unique. A place all visitors to Italy must see. A great place to just wander around taking photos",
          "To see the authentic houses was amazing. There are a lot of nice shops where you can go and it is all within distance. Specially the \"chilli \" shop is recommanded.",
          "This is a very charming little village, which yes, is a bit if a tourist trap. The thing is, the building of the trulli is becoming a dying art and I'm very happy that UNESCO saw fit to preserve it. Look closely at the roofs, at the precision that each piece of stone is hand",
          "It\u2019s quite fascinating how these places have stood for so long. They are of simple architectural design and have a great historical story behind them. Although the area is hard to park and very busy with tourists all fighting for the best spot for a picture there are also some",
          "Unique experience. The Trulli are filled with tourist shops. We spend at most 2 hours. However, one hour is enough.",
          "I visited here with a small group. One resident was so nice as to let us visit and see the interior of his house. It seemed like a cosy comfortable space. Although there were a lot of tourists walking around and it seemed like it would be stressful for people living there.",
          "It's a nice town to visit as it is unique and that's why it is a must. I was a bit disappointed though as I've heard so much about it for many years and expected probably a bit too much. It's a lovely place, very touristy as expected and the food was also good. We got there 3",
          "A fascinating historical insight into southern Italian history, politics and culture. Lots of photo opportunities.",
          "This place has been on my bucket list for some time now and WOW it did not disappoint. Every corner you turn is a postcard moment. if you are travelling to the Puglia region the is a DO NOT MISS destination on you travels",
          "Wonderful place, trullis are magic, lots of little place to buy souvenirs, prices aren\u2019t bad, local folks are very kind and welcoming.",
          "If you're staying in Puglia, it's worth a visit. A fascinating place, particularly if you get to one of the viewing points looking over the tops of the Trulli's. However if our visit is typical it's over-run with tourists and small shops selling low-grade, mass produced tat to",
          "Whilst staying at a hostel in Bari I was offered the chance of a guided tour of Alberobello. Gianfranco was the kindest and most knowledgeable of guides. We stopped and looked at trulli ruins on the way from Bari to Alberobello before arriving in the unique world heritage site",
          "Trulli houses are all over Puglia but here you get to see many all bunched together. Quite a few tourists I'm afraid but worth a trip.",
          "A place we have anted to visit for a long time and we finally go to do it. Definitely worth going to see these amazing structures. A do not miss site in Italy which only means one of millions!!!",
          "Beautiful location plenty to see. Stayed in a very nice B&B la mia dimora, good value for money, spotless clean and spacious easy parking very central free mini fridge.",
          "We went to visit the site. We were staying just outside Ostuni. About a hours drive. No direct roads in this part of Italy. We'll worth the visit. Unusual architecture. Town full of tourists. Go after lunch. Easier to park and less packed. Park at the sand parking closest to the",
          "A small town, very interesting! You have to visit it. 2 hours are enough. The small houses are part of a Magic story. There are a lot of souvenir shops, where after you buy something you can go upstairs on the roof to take some photos of the city and a great view. There are a",
          "Trulli are so special, never seen something like that. It is definitely worth visiting. But some tips: It gets very buy on Summer months, if you don\u2019t like crowds beware. The machine for the parking was broken, for the reactions of the shops when we were to ask for change, it",
          "We did this via a tour which is a great way to go. We got on a bus at the port and traveled to the sight with a tour guide giving us great history of the area prior to arrival. The buses however, stop some distance from the heritage site however, meaning you have a good 15-20",
          "This is well worth a visit, it is very remarkable and stunning. Lots of restaurants, cafes places to get a drink. Some shops- some of which quite touristy. Go in evening as sun going down as views stunning. I wouldn\u2019t stay in this town, generally restaurants more pricey than",
          "Several hours will suffice to explore the town with its main attractions located on both sides of the town centre. When arriving by bus, be prepared for some 10-15 walk up the street until you've started to see the trullis.",
          "That's not must to see. A shipping mall in the centre of Apulia. Teens of small showrooms with the same goods. Nothing else. The Trullo Sovrano cannot be visited after 7.00 pm.",
          "The stone huts with conical roofs , the happy people, typical food orechiette pasta alla putanesca,, delicious gelato, the town view from the top of the hill and strolling on the side streets are just the few reasons to visit Alberobello.",
          "The trulli are peculiar small cylindrical houses, organized as a village. Typical food (Orrechiette pasta preparation), traditional clothes and dance. Nice photos. Children will like Tapsy, a funny character mole that appears in the light and well conducted cultural tour.",
          "When in Puglia visiting the UNESCO heritage Trulli houses is a must regardless where you\u2019re from. At day time it\u2019s mostly tourists and at night it\u2019s more Italian.",
          "We loved Alberobello. Beautiful little town with a excellent restaurants. We rented a Trulli. It was very comfortable for a couple. With a separate kitchenette and good size bathroom. No wifi but all the restaurants in the piazza have free WiFi.",
          "So many of these remarkable buildings in one small area, even the church is in the same style. The view of the area from the other side of the town is great and worth the walk, to climb up to get the views. Allow yourself at least 1 hour and half to have a good look round, can",
          "Alberobello is on the top of my list of most beautiful places to visit. It\u2019s a city of white and sandstone, and the Trulli houses are incredible. A simple architecture that creates an enchanting city scape! These houses are built from stone with no mortar... so they are easily",
          "We liked Alberobello, just to stroll stroll around and take in the city. The houses are unique and nice to see. By chance we were there during the Taranta festival, wich ment concert in the city with folk music (?).",
          "but seriously don\u2019t travel too far because it\u2019s far from quaint or historic. It\u2019s a tourist trap pure and simple",
          "You can\u2019t stay in the area without going up Alberobello. One side of the town is very touristic, the others side more quiet which we licked more. Worth the travel but a touristic area and it can be crowded.",
          "This is a very unique location. Yes it\u2019s a tourist hub and busy - but don\u2019t let that out you off. It has to be seen. Great stunning environment.",
          "A living heritage site. Unique in the world and stunning to see how these homes where build using the basic materials that where available. Roofs completly build out of flagstones. Looks like a magical village",
          "My family and I were only here for 2 nights but we really enjoyed visiting this quirky little town, it\u2019s definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. A lot of the Trulli are actually home to shops and restaurants and it\u2019s fun to walk up and down the narrow little streets to",
          "Wow!!! This place is picture postcard perfect. Laid back, dreamy, not too large or busy. Plenty of lovely places to stop for food and drink. Friendly locals and well priced. Hope this doesn\u2019t become the next Positano, with the Instagram crowd.",
          "The Trulli houses were my favourite part of my 16 day trip to Puglia. They\u2019re absolutely gorgeous! Alberobello has so many of them, including a Trulli church, and the all looked so beautiful, inside and out. Well worth a visit. My dream now is to stay in a Trulli house. They",
          "We stayed in a hotel on the outskirts of ALBEROBELLO FOR 3 nights while in Italy. It was @ a 20 minute walk into the centre where all the shops restaurants and of course the Trullis are. We went into the centre every day, and although most reviews seem to say a few hours is",
          "Loved this beautiful town, but unfortunately so did far too many other tourists. It has become very commercial and there are just hundreds of shops lining the main roads. It was extremely hot, which made it uncomfortable. I personally preferred to trullos that were scattered",
          "After a train journey from Bari we unexpectedly had to transfer to a bus for the last part of the journey. We alighted the bus not knowing where to go, it took quite a bit of wasted time trying to find the site but it was well worth it. The main street was made up of trulli",
          "Visited in early June in blistering heat. Found parking right in the centre but coins needed for the machine as the card facility was not operating. Very pretty place and not crowded when we arrived early in the day but the tour groups soon arrived as this unique place is",
          "Looking at the hill covered with Trullis isnice to see but once you start walking amongst them you find its one big souvenir shop, like San Marino, Gallipoli among others. My tip drive into the piazza take photos and drive on.",
          "We got a park in an almost empty car park at the very end of the Main Street in June. About a 10 minute walk to the Trulli. Quite busy around the Trulli but worth the drive from Matera. See if you can find the Trulli house that has no mortar or whitewash. Sorry unable to say",
          "Very cute unique buildings in the town- lovely to walk around but you only need a few hours as it\u2019s not very big. All the shops are set up for tourists and there are plenty of them so if you want less busy pictures you need to be there before 9am. Worth a trip to have a look",
          "Very interesting place. The residents are full of pride and enjoy showing you there houses. Cherry treats everywhere.",
          "We did enjoy our early afternoon at the heritage site, walked around the village and visited various handy craft shops.",
          "amazing town - village like for fairy tales!!! try to see the truly area early in the morning or late in the evening - when there are mostly locals ;)",
          "We walked around the trulli homes and learned how and why the were built. We had a guide who told us about the conical roofs, changes that have occurred in the trullis over time based on the needs of the people, the cisterns beneath, the limestone painted walls, the ornaments",
          "Trulli are houses built by the stacking stone with conical roof. It was constructed since 16th century and was speculated as a way to avoid paying property tax as the building structure can be dismantled easily. The houses were deserted in 20th century and was restored in 21st",
          "Super cute place to get lost a take 100 pictures. No toooo touristy, and you can walk wherever you want. Nice restaurants and caffees.",
          "What a wonderful small town. The unique houses built on the hill are very special to see. There are several good restaurants to lunch or diner.",
          "Wonderful. Simply stunning. Yes full of tourist \"tat\" but cannot take away from the beauty of the place.",
          "Walk up the road leading to the Trulli church. There are lots of Trullis to see and lots of little shops and cafes that are worth a visit.",
          "Very unique place. Nice people. Unique shopping. Truly a must go place. Yes there is some hills to stroll up.",
          "Having taken the mini bus from our hotel to Alberobello there is one main street on one side there\u2019s Alberobello and on the other is the world heritage Alberobello white trulli houses and shops all uphill and all very picturesque but watch out for the stone steps we found them",
          "The trulli houses were very charming. It was very crowded because it was the weekend but well worth the visit.",
          "This place is a fairy-tale, the wonderful houses and the feeling that you get on the streets is magical. The place also has lots of traditional workshops ( the leather-work here is amazing) and you can visit the insides of the houses and also climb in some to get a view of the",
          "A must see in Puglia due its Trulli houses and picturesque streets. The main town has tastefully modernised the trulli houses into shops, restaurants, bars etc but have still retained the mythical feel. Reminds me a lot of Cornish fishing villages, once the houses of poor",
          "What an amazing place, wonder through the streets and see the wonderful truilli houses, very touristy with lots of tourist shops in the houses and there are only a few streets that are worth visiting. We were there for less than 2 hours and what we valued more was seeing the",
          "Had been wanting to see these hours and this town for a while! and it was so beautiful! It really was a unique landscape and beautiful town! Will say that with the amount of tourists, it can get very touristy and very overrun. Go early to get parking and beat some of the",
          "We had seen quite a lot of photographs of these cute little houses before our trip, yet we were totally unprepared to the magical atmosphere of this special place! The narrow, winding streets between the Trulli, the ancient symbols on their roofs, the warm, Mediterranean",
          "I visited Alberobello in March this year. Although it was sunny and the weather was beautiful, it was very windy and cold; therefore, be careful when you plan your trip there, the weather might trick you. The site itself is like a piece of a fairyland, which somehow reminds you",
          "This is a must see! If you have a chance to see one that has not yet been refurbished, even better! The history and the fact that they still stand is astounding. I talked with a local who told me that 20 years ago if you told someone in Italy you lived in a trullo they would",
          "Most has been said, and I can only agree. This is a unique and wonderful place that alsmost anyone will love. Easy to walk around, clean and well renovated.",
          "This city is unique,wonderful and is a must if you visit Puglia. We walked on the small charming streets and is a little paradise",
          "Without peer this is Puglia\u2019s tourism superstar with exerts a fairytale fascination on account of its truly, the whitewashed houses that sit beneath conical roofs made from limestone slabs, held together as if by magic. The trulli occupy an entire hillside, more than 1000 of",
          "This is a most unusual place and, until I came here, had never heard of it. Around the countryside you see many constructions like this but to find a whole village like this was remarkable. We we fortunate enough to find a tourist shop which allowed free access to their roof",
          "We visited on a cool May evening. The place was still busy and full of people taking selfies. There are plenty of tacky tourist shops if you want to spend your money The Trulli (when you get past the crowds and shops) are good. Worth a walk around. But do not waste a full day",
          "Truely an amazing place. Only 10 residents still reside in ancient conical houses. An opportunity to visit inside some of them and the church further up the street. Originally built illegally so not to pay taxes to the king. Some of them were dismantled daily not to attract",
          "It seems that we did not go at the same place as others!! This is the first Unesco site that is a tourist trap. You will see truli all around in the valle d'Itria. You can easily skip the visit at Alberobello. If you go try to be there early to skip all the tourist. Plan a",
          "Really unique. If you are looking for an extraordinary experience for a special occasion THIS is it!",
          "This is a must to visit if you are in Puglia. The town is now very touristy but the story and history of the Trulls is great. Make sure to have a guide or some explanation of the why the Trulli were built.",
          "Alberobello is well worth visiting and the Trulli houses are stunning. Tourists are well catered for as there are plenty of restaurants and gelataria.",
          "Trulli houses are unique. Take the time to have a good walk around as there is plenty to see. Be aware that the streets are hilly and might be difficult for those with mobility problems.",
          "Amazing , trulli's everywhere , such a lovely picturesque town, with such heritage.well worth the visit.",
          "While it is true the main street has all been turned into shops, there is still much to see and opportunities for lots of beautiful pictures. And there are an estimated 1400 trullis within the town that are still private residences! What we did not expect were the hundreds",
          "Lovely to walk around taking in the atmosphere of a town from another time, reasonably priced souvenirs, food and drinks a plenty and again very reasonably priced.",
          "Great to look around and once all the \u2018day trippers\u2019 have gone by around 1800 then it takes on a mystical feel. Restaurants are amazing and in abundance. Book in advance.",
          "Short trip on return to Bari. Stunning but very touristy. Shopkeepers all seemed surprisingly patient and not pushy which surprised. Could have spent longer here but timetables got in way.",

          "The Trulli houses are very interesting. Some date back to the 15th century. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The downtown area has become a bit touristy but still worth the visit for it's uniqueness. Many houses are now shops, many selling trinkets and souvenirs.",
          "We were on a group tour so quickly peeled off to look at the trulli in this town. It\u2019s not a wonder that it is a world heritage site. Most of them have been renovated, consequently the town looks very twee.",
          "A great sensation the site of all these ancient mignature houses. Gorgeous and very romantico to visit at night, where the whole village lights up in an explosion of colours.",
          "The first top of our Eastern Mediteranean cruise was Bari. While the cruise ship offered tours of the city, we opted to go to Alberobello to see the Trullis. It is about an hour bus ride from the port, but is a pretty drive through olive orchards and farms. I would have loved",
          "Visited as part of a Saga tour. One side of the town is very steep, but the other is easier to access if there are old and not so fit folk in your tour. We had local guide who explained the way living in the Trulli works. Very nice ice cream available in the main street if the",
          "This is \u201ctrulli\u201d a unique city to visit. The Trullo\u2019s provide a unique look at the history and culture of this area. Some good museums in this town are worth a visit. It is also fun to walk the streets and enter the myriad of souvenir shops. It makes for a nice day trip.",
          "We spent a night in Alberobello and it is wonderful place to stay. Especially in the evening, when the most day-Tourists have left the town, it is very charming. The streets are not crowded anymore and you can enjoy the magical atmosphere. Very special place in the world!",
          "Don't miss out on Alberobello if you are in the area. It is a delightful town. Small enough to be able to see the heart of it in a short day. Full of character and unique architecture!",
          "What a magnificent area to see these houses with stone roofs. Parking is available close by at \u20ac4. There are two main areas of truli. One with shops, restaurants and bars and the other where people live. Take comfortable shoes to walk up and down the steep village roads. In",
          "We were 2 adults and a 14yr old and we visited in mid-April. We bought return train tickets from Bari Centrale to Alberobello for \u20ac5 or \u20ac8 pp. The train company is FSE and it is found at Central station. Train left Bari round 0830hrs and took round 2hrs. Last stop was",

          "An amazing half-day activity from Bari. Can be crowded, don\u2019t expect on empty streets. More and more tourists know about this heritage. Transportation from Bari is made by train and bus (very crowded, prepare for that). The trulli houses are truly beautiful. You can enter in",
          "These lovely little houses are so unusual and the area is worth a visit. However the Trulli di Alberobello site is very crowded and very touristy with tacky shops. If you have a car drive around the area and see examples of Trulli houses in different settings.",
          "Alberobello won't take you the whole day. If you are staying in Bari it's like 50 min drive and 2-3 hours in the village will do. Very kept and clean. Nice shops and cafes.",
          "This was my main reason for visiting Puglia and it certainly did not disappoint, delightfully different, it was like a stroll through the shires of the Hobbit. The local train station was not accessible when we visited and so we had to take a bus from Alberobello main station",

          "Clearly, UNESCO and tourists have discovered the Trulli at Alberobello. They are uniquely appealing. You may find yourself smiling, as you discover their evident and hidden charms. Learn about their history and construction, and get a town map, as there is a less visited cluster",
          "Very unusual in appearance limestone dwellings, like homes of mythical creatures. It turns out that the houses were designed and constructed to be sturdy without the use of mortar. This was to avoid a tribute/tax to the Kingdom. The conical shaped roofs are made of limestone",

          "We spent one night in Alberobello in a trullo. The town was very quiet since it was February and quite cold and windy, but that made the experience so much nicer as we sat by a pellet fire in our trullo. We were two of the few tourists around. We saw the basilica, the very",

          "Yes, it is worth visiting for sure but it was not very exciting to be honest. Too many tourists although we have been there during low season(end of September). I would rather recommend going to Matera rather than Alberobello. Parking is another story. We parked a car at",
          "The \"real\" trulli homes are unique and beautiful and I enjoyed the history behind them. Our guide was from the area and very knowledgeable. We were able to get into one of them for a real view into what life might be like in them. The commercial trulli village is also a lot of",

          "November provided more than one great day, and this one was a perfect. We enjoyed the municipal museum, the quiet ambience of the community, the magnificient Basilica and the many views of the Trulli homes.",
          "The trulli site is something worth visiting at least once in a lifetime. The souvernir shops are very nice in contrast to the white trullis but some sellers are rude and don\u2019t allow you to make pictures. In one shop we wanted to buy something and only after buying taking a",
          "We went on a trip from our cruise ship to this idyllic Village, which is a world heritage site. The \u201cTrulli style houses are an amazing sight and some which are now shops you can enter and be amazed with their construction. Don\u2019t miss these!",
          "Can really only be described as remarkable. A simple place that looks stunningly fantastic. Very photogenic with some great little shops and cafes restaurants etc but so nice to walk amongst these lovely houses with their little pixie rooves. A really nice place to spend a few",
          "We planned our entire vacation around a visit to the Trulli houses of Alberobello and the houses didn't disappoint. This is an absolutely adorable village filled with winding alleys and lots of Trulli. The streets are quite narrow however and even on a rainy fall day, were",
          "Loved wandering around this extraordinary place with my two children 11,10.. Very pretty streets with a lot of the trulli selling souvenirs.. Best time to visit is late afternoon getting the sun setting on the rooftops. Very special place",
          "Say Puglia and what comes to mind are the Trulli houses - they're the photo used on every travel brochure, so its not surprising that the whole town is very commercialised. The houses themselves, and there are over 1000 of them, are worth seeing, but it is all very commercial.",
          "Lovely areas of the trulli. Surprised by the vast number of the trulli still in existence over the entire area",
          "Interesting place but a shame they have spoilt a world heritage site with so many souvenir shops and tacky shops, would be nice to see it in its original state.",
          "Over 1,000 tiny huts are dispersed throughout the town of Alberobello. As you weave your way through the cobblestone streets, one house is just as cute as the other. One couple invited us in to see their simple decorated house. A lot of the stores sell olive oil since Puglia",
          "The Trulli homes were different than anything we had ever seen, in Italy or elsewhere.. We stayed in a Trulli in an Air BnB in Coreggia just outside Alberobello. We also enjoyed seeing the concentration of trullis within the city of Alberobello and the old ones in the country",
          "If you're in Puglia, you MUST come to Alberobello and see the amazing Trulli houses. Only one thing better is to see the \"origina'\" houses built on the farms. Quite amazing. Don't miss out!",
          "A delightful place to visit and stroll around with shops ,artisan outlets and restaurants. We met lots of people from all over the world and spent time chatting over a glass of wine/ beer. Well worth a visit",
          "This is an incredibly unique place in southern Italy! It is so different from any place in the area with a style all it\u2019s own. Coned roof architecture! It\u2019s worth the visit to see, but you will only need half a day or so.",
          "We visited and stayed in Alberobello. It is very quaint, most visitors stay for a day or two, we stayed for as week and enjoyed every minute of it. From here we went to many neighbouring villages. The prices of the restaurants are very reasonable, i will be writing about them",
          "The Trulli are absolutely amazing. They date back a thousand years. They are mortarless constructions found all over the Itrian Valley but as residences, there are over a thousand located in Alberobello.",
          "I have been to Alberobello many times and it is always a wonderful experience. It is many years since my last visit and it has got somewhat commercialised and busy but it doesn\u2019t detract from the beauty of these little houses. You can go inside some which are free but there is",
          "A short train journey from Bari, and you find yourself in Alberobello, and unusual looking white houses called Trulli. It really cannot be explained how people managed to live in such small habitats !!",
          "We hired a car to drive around Puglia and heard about the Trulli di Alberobello. Parked the car outside the centro and walked about 5-10 mins to the Trulli which are beautiful however once you have walked around for 45 mins or so and taken some photos there isn't much else to",
          "A truly magical place. The thousand or so Trulli houses are one of the wonders of the world. A lot of the ancient ones are now shops and bars etc. Visiting here was our main reason for visiting Italy and we weren\u2019t disappointed. Get yourself there.",
          "Very unusual! That is what you are looking for when you travel... see things that are flabergasting! Exactly how we felf about this!",
          "As the pictures will state, we enjoyed this place and spent a few evenings here watching the sun set. A very lovely aged slow town which makes you relax and enjoy south Italy as it should be",
          "despite there are trullis allover alberobello the main trulli area is a place that, once visited will not be forgotten. this funny buildings, made to avoid paying taxes are a really beautifull and pictoresque heritage unfortunately, it is crowded with tourist. i recommend to",
          "It is easy to see this town in a day. In the center of town, near the fountain, make sure you see the overlook over the town.",
          "Definitely worth a day trip, even better to see lit at night, lots of good restaurants and a few interesting attaractions like the 2 storey Trulli and the Cathedral, but just a great place to wander round and admire the beautiful Trulli. Note that parking can be a bit of an",
          "Visited Alberobello from Martina Franca which is only a 3 0minute drive away so managed to arrive at 9.00 am before the tour buses and crowds. By mid morning it was starting to get busy as the bus tours arrived. We were able to park close to the Trulli houses only a short walk",
          "An extraordinary town comprised of old beehive style white buildings called Trulli. They are small and were occupied by local peasants. Nowadays they are beginning to be renovated and used as B & Bs. They string along street after street winding through this ancient community.",
          "The village with Truilli is so unique (particolare) and the town so pristine - great to walk around and photo opportunities around every corner. I took a train from Bari which is very convenient (although it is quite slow because it is single rail system). The Trulli village",
          "This is one of the most unique and interesting sites I have been to in years. The buildings are fascinating as is the history. DO NOT MISS!",
          "This is my third time visiting this unique Unesco site. Attracts many visitors from around the world. Definitely a place to see.",
          "The history of the Trulli are amazing and if you are in Puglia one should visit this World Heritage site. The Trulli \u201chobbit like\u201d structures have a long and rich history spanning centuries, and like every historical site around Italy, there are always great places to grab a",
          "Totally amazing is an understatement. There are 1000 trulli in this town and we had a tour guide showing us around. The stone houses could be from another planet or at least Narnia. The town is delightfully unhurried and you can stroll through the town and visit the vans shops",
          "You cannot see the old and history in it. Is just a big bazaar full of tourists, with a sort of a church at the end of the main alley.",
          "Visited Alberobello with a Riviera group touring Puglia. Arrived mid morning and therefore relatively quiet to start with ( it gets very busy later when coaches bringing cruise ship tourists from Bari arrive). A short walk from the coach park into the centre of the small town",
          "We went just outside the main tourist season but was still busy, but get there early to avoid tourist groups. Its just a short walk from the station and going by train makes it easy to find and not worry about parking. Tee buildings are interesting and its possible to avoid many",
          "A very picturesque destination! The small town has been made a UNESCO World Heritage site for its unusual districts of trulli, the characteristic white-washed conical-roofed houses of the area. The best way to experience trulli is to stay in one. Rather than snatching a look",
          "Beautiful place, very romantic. We love this place. People are very friendly. Highly recommended. Please avoid Risto Pub Altro Cafe",
          "Planned to visit most of the day--parking was plentiful, but directions to site were not--consequently headed off in wrong direction for half an hour. Ended up discovering it accidentally, and enjoyed the houses. Would have liked a central location that provided a little",
          "Very interesting architecture but a lot of the houses are tourist shops. The best views are on the way to the main square.",
          "Unique experience to the Italian valley. Like walking in \u201cHobbitsville\u201d not the most friendly for the disabled unfortunately but we ha dumm in wheelchair and managed through some alternative routes. Lots of little eateries and bars down Main Street quite nice to sit have a drink",
          "I will recommend to visit Alberobello and the towns close to it. We saw it in a travel channel and always admire it. I can tell you you have to be there to be able to understand the construction, the area, their history, their food and their people.",
          "Whatever your reaction, you must visit Alberobello and see the trulli houses. The Main Street is full of shops selling tat as well as rather expensive road side cafes serving mediocre food to hoards of tourists. However, take a walk in the old town and you will have a",
          "We were 3 couples and had 3 trullis number 12 was the biggest very comfortable although very basic stayed for 4 nights just enough time. Breakfast in nearby restaurant was very good. Good ice-cream parlours on way back from dinner. Very central too",
          "Our tips are try to be as out of season as possible and arrive early. Also, park in the Zone A just above, but very close by for cheap parking at 60 cents per hour instead of zone B 2 Euros. We allowed 3 hours which was about right (without stopping for lunch). We went late Sep",

          "The overall impression of the Trulli houses is amazing. The winding streets and alleyways are fun to explore. Go early to avoid the mass invasion. The endless tacky souvenir shops have to be viewed as inevitable and amusing. If you buy a Trulli model house make sure its the",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Alberobello, picturesque interesting, unfussy. We wish we had booked to stay in one of the Truly wonderful Trullies. We parked near the station and were amazed after having walked through the main square to see many clusters of the Trulli",
          "We used the 'top down' approach starting from the St Anthony church downstairs and it's not been easy since , due to the heavy traffic the stairs are very slippery ! Nevertheless the atmosphere especially at sunset is very nice and very specific , due to the strange constructions",
          "Definitely worth a visit as this is such a picturesque, pretty little town. The Trulli are gorgeous. Lots of tourist shops, some selling nice quality Knick knacks, rather the usual touristy tat. Several cafes and restaurants. We arrived very early to avoid the crowds and the",
          "Take care in several shops with prices, we experienced two instances of overcharging and short changing.. Fortunately speaking g Italian it was quickly remedied.",
          "Very interesting place quite fascinating in its architecture and for the purpose it was built this way. However its very very touristy and had to park miles away and walk in (Well 15mins) However the the tourist information booth shuts at the most awkward times for about 2",
          "We stayed locally so it was no effort to go and wander around the streets of Alberobello. The little houses are so cute, each one decorated the same from a distance but they often have different symbols on the roofs. The little emblem on the very top apparently is the symbol of",
          "When you walk inside and around these wonderful Trulli, you feel like you're in a fairytale! They are so well-kept and each Trullo sells trinkets, traditional food and souvenirs. It's a wonderful way to spend an hour or two of your time. The only thing I found annoying were the",
          "Staying in a trullo a few miles away, we naturally had to visit Alberobello and its comune clusters of trulli. The history of its 16/17th Century beginnings and the dry stone building methods to avoid taxes is interesting. Being a UNESCO site gives it protection (to the point of",
          "Yes visiting this place is a must if you are visiting the Puglia region. The trulli village is something not to be missed especially if you go after sunset as you will be able to see the changing colours ob the various Trulli. I am sure you will enjoy this visit.",
          "It is far more than history and preserved village, it is amazing and must city place to see and understand how it was built. Nice shops and nice walk at the same time with panoramic views of the trullis",
          "There is no other place like this in the world. Needs to be seen. Fascinating constructions that are still in use. A pity that touristic sales has been massified and so a lot of such \"trulli\" are now shops, which i personally do not like.",
          "The Trulli are truly unique and a definite destination visit. Alberobello is quite touristy but worth looking past this to enjoy the unique nature of this site and opportunity to see Trulli in their natural state on the way into town. Good restaurants to enjoy but worth booking",
          "We visited with a tour group and arrived about 10.30am on a Monday. It wasn\u2019t too busy to start with and our guide could tell from the car park that there were no cruise ship parties there yet so advised us to tour the left part first as that is the very popular part with all",
          "This is a pretty little area that is becomes very packed by mid-morning. I would get there early (we got there around 8) to avoid the masses. Each trulli is made into some type of shop. Better to go to Ostuni or Locorotondo in the afternoon, which are lovely spots, and not quite",
          "This is a world heritage site with over 1400 trulli concentrated together. This is what makes site awsum. We saw many trullis while traveling in Puglia. They are all protected by law. Villa we stayed in had 9 foot trullis that kept the rooms cool. Town is nice and built for",
          "Alberobello is a beautiful little town and bigger than I thought it was going to be - the Trullis are amazing and there loads of them up the streets off the main square. There are some nice shops and some shops selling rubbish (but you don\u2019t need to go in them ! ) Plenty of",
          "Being told that this is s UNESCO world heritage site and recommended to see I was really exited. What I didn't take into account was how small the place is, how MANY tourists are there, how much touristic knick knack is being sold and how impossible it is to get a table. Most",

          "These houses are as if from the other planet )) Very special, very interesting, perfect for photos and walking. You may use train from Bari Centrale for 5 euro (it takes 2 hours but this trip is a kind of excursion through Puglia countryside).",
          "Took a 2hr side trip while heading from Bari to Lecce. It is an impressive and unique view. Especially the hillside with all the Trulli across the new city. Though as other reviews say the ubiquitous gift shops get on ones nerves. A Unesco site should be better protected from",

          "We were driving from the East of Italy to the West and I was looking for places to stop. This was one of them and it was amazing. The trulli were so beautiful, there were built without any cement or mortar and the roof was built like a cone so the water would run off quickly. We",
          "This area is an amazing amalgam of hilltop villages and the amazing Trulli houses. Hire a car and travel between them leisurely but be sure to go to Martina Franco. The coffee is fresh good quality and very reasonably priced compared to the UK and the Gellato is just brilliant.",

          "It was an interesting stop, albeit a bit out of our way. Having been to Italy many times for the past 20 years, I never heard about this place until I decided to visit. Then, everyone let me know that it was a wonderful place to visit. It was an interesting place and well worth",
          "Was worth the trip and I liked it a lot . Beside that is obviously a turistic place I hoped more flair more love around. Anyway nice and worth to say I was there",
          "We had a great morning here, walking the streets, looking at the architecture and visiting a couple of local churches. My wife was keen to go here due to the significance of the town and its buildings. They are great examples of a home built for their time, being cool in summer",
          "Beautiful view of all the trulli houses from the Belvedere. You walk down from Piazza del popolo and the trulli houses are spread in front of you below. Rione aia piccola is quieter and has many holiday homes. Rione Monti is full of trulli houses now converted into souvenir",

          "This is a very very special place. the history of these magnificent dwellings is amazing and it's very special to be able to meander around them. Tip for photographing them : get up early and catch the morning light on them, softer and lovelier (or sunset) and NOT SO MANY",
          "A magical and enchanting place to visit. Lots of little streets lined with Trulli, some are shops, some houses, there\u2019s even a church!

          "It is hard to describe how it makes you feel when you first arrive into the centre of Alberobello & see the Trulli houses for the first time - it is like you have walked into a fairytale. I believe most people would come to Alberobello on a tour & be here for a few hours, snap",

          "Truly the highlight of any visit to Puglia. We would advise going first thing in the morning or later in the day. We had large groups of school children on field trips at every turn. It was not until after lunch when we went out to wander again that the children had cleared out.",

          "These houses/buildings are really neat. I never imagined that anyone would construct houses in this manner but when I saw them it made sense. If you're in this region Alberobello is worth a visit. The drive through the countryside to get there is scenic and very pleasant. Also,",

          "The trulli are truly cute and charming, but why on earth is everything around them so horrible? Ugly new buildings and tourist services spoil it all.... worth seeing anyway though. 30 minutes, probably not much more, unless you want to pop into the little shops.",

          "Trulli (singular: trullo) can be seen dotted on farms (their natural environment) throughout the region. But these quaint little rural huts-turned-residential homes, all gathered in a township is something else. The main drag is filled with trulli converted to tourist tat shops",
          "Trulli houses dot the landscape of this part of Puglia, so you will see them as you drive about, but Alberobello has the greatest concentration of them. It's an interesting scene to be sure, but as others have noted, the town is just overrun with tourists and shops selling the",

          "You have to get here and have a look at these dwellings. The pointed roofs are made from flat stones and there is no mortar, they are placed so meticulously as to just defy the laws of gravity. Inside it is all lime and stone. Very compact. The streets are narrow as well. This",

        "wiki": "The Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish: Mezquita-Catedral de C\u00f3rdoba), also known as the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish: Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba) and the Mezquita, whose ecclesiastical name is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption (Spanish: Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n), is the Catholic cathedral of the Diocese of C\u00f3rdoba dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and located in the Spanish region of Andalusia. The structure is regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture.\nAccording to a traditional account, a small Visigoth church, the Catholic Basilica of Saint Vincent of L\u00e9rins, originally stood on the site. In 784 Abd al-Rahman I ordered construction of the Great Mosque, which was considerably expanded by later Muslim rulers. C\u00f3rdoba returned to Christian rule in 1236 during the Reconquista, and the building was converted to a Catholic church, culminating in the insertion of a Renaissance cathedral nave in the 16th century.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIt is commonly believed that the site of the Mosque-Cathedral was originally a Christian church dedicated to Saint Vincent the Third, which was divided and shared by Muslims and Christians after the Islamic conquest of the Visigothic kingdom. This sharing arrangement of the site lasted until 784, when the Christian half was purchased by the Emir Abd al-Rahman I, who then proceeded to demolish the original structure and build the grand mosque of C\u00f3rdoba on its ground. This narrative, which goes back to the tenth-century historian al-Razi, echoed similar narratives of the Islamic conquest of Syria, in particular the story of building the Great Mosque of Damascus. For medieval Muslim historians, these parallels served to highlight a dynastic Umayyad conquest of Spain and appropriation of the Visigothic C\u00f3rdoba. The historicity of this narrative has been challenged, as archaeological evidence is scant, and the narrative is not corroborated by contemporary accounts of the events following Abd al-Rahman I's initial arrival in al-Andalus. Another tenth-century source mentions a church that stood at the site of the mosque without giving further details. However, it is almost certain that the building which housed the original mosque was destroyed to build the first version of the Great Mosque. An archaeological exhibit in the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of Cordoba displays fragments of a Visigothic building, emphasizing an originally Christian nature of the complex. According to Susana Calvo Capilla, a specialist on the history of the Mosque\u2013Cathedral, although remains of multiple church-like buildings have been located on the territory of the Mosque-Cathedral complex, no clear archaeological evidence has been found of where either the church of St. Vincent or the first mosque were located on the site, and the latter may have been a newly constructed building. The evidence suggests that it may have been the grounds of an episcopal complex rather than a particular church which were initially divided between Muslims and Christians.\n\nAccording to a traditional account, when the exiled Umayyad prince Abd al-Rahman I escaped to Iberia and defeated the governor of Al-Andalus, Yusuf al-Fihri, he found the Cordovese divided into various sects, including the Gnostics, Priscillianists, Donatists, and Luciferians. His ambition was to erect a temple which would rival in magnificence those of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, and approach in sanctity the fame of Mecca. Above a Christian church dedicated to Saint Vincent, Abd al-Rahman decided to raise his great mosque. He offered to buy the church and the plot. The negotiations for the sale were placed in the hands of the Sultan's favourite secretary, Umeya ibn Yezid. Under the terms of the transfer, the Cordovese were permitted to reconstruct the church formerly dedicated to Saints Faustus, Januarius, and Marcellus, three Christian martyrs whom they deeply revered.\n\nAbd al-Rahman allowed the Christians to rebuild their ruined churches and purchased the Christian half of the church of St Vincent, as agreed upon in the sale terms. The Emirate was rich. Apart from the treasure wrested from the Goths during the recent wars, he also extracted a tithe upon the produce of the land and on manufactures. All able Muslims in Andalusia were asked to pay the zakat. A mandatory tax known as jizya was also laid upon only one able Christian and Jew per household in Andalusia as a precondition for services & protection provided by the government of Andalusia, unless they participated in the protection services themselves. They were one of the main sources of income for the Muslim rulers in lands occupied by Islamic tribes but populated still by Christians, to provide all needed services for all people living in the land, especially the poor. Beyond this, the Moorish kings were greatly enriched by the acquisition of the valuable mines of Iberia, the quarries of marble, and other sources of wealth. From these revenues Abd al-Rahman and his successors, Hisham, Abd-al Rahman II, the greatest of the dynasty and the third of the line, and lastly the extravagant Almanzor, lavished large sums upon the designing, construction, and costly adornment of the Mosque. Abd al-Rahman I and his descendants reworked the building over the next two centuries to fashion it as a mosque, starting in 784. Additionally, Abd al-Rahman I used the mosque (originally called Aljama Mosque) as an adjunct to his palace and named it in honour of his wife. Traditionally, the mihrab (or apse) of a mosque faces in the direction of Mecca; by facing the mihrab, worshipers pray towards Mecca. Mecca is east-southeast of the mosque, but the mihrab of this mosque unusually points south.The work of building the resplendent Mezquita employed thousands of artisans and labourers, and such a vast undertaking led to the development of all the resources of the district. Hard stone and beautifully veined marble were quarried from the Sierra Morena and the surrounding regions of the city. Metals of various kinds were dug up from the soil, and factories sprang up in C\u00f3rdoba amid the stir and bustle of an awakened industrial energy. A famous Syrian architect made the plans for the Mosque. Leaving his own house on the edge of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emir came to reside in the city, so that he might personally superintend the operations and offer proposals for the improvement of the designs. Abd al-Rahman moved about among the workers, directing them for several hours of every day.The mosque underwent numerous subsequent changes: Abd al-Rahman II ordered a new minaret, while in 961 Al-Hakam II enlarged the building and enriched the Mihrab. The last of such reforms was carried out by Almanzor in 987. It was connected to the Caliph's palace by a raised walkway, mosques within the palaces being the tradition for previous Islamic rulers \u2013 as well as Christian Kings who built their palaces adjacent to churches. The Mezquita reached its current dimensions in 987 with the completion of the outer naves and courtyard.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nIn planning the mosque, the architects incorporated a number of Roman columns with choice capitals. Some of the columns were already in the Gothic structure; others were sent from various regions of Iberia as presents from the governors of provinces. Ivory, jasper, porphyry, gold, silver, copper, and brass were used in the decorations. Marvellous mosaics and azulejos were designed. Panels of scented woods were fastened with nails of pure gold, and the red marble columns were said to be the work of God. The primitive part of the building, erected under the direction of Abd al-Rahman I., was that which borders the Court of Oranges. Later, the immense temple embodied all the styles of Morisco architecture into one composition.The Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba held a place of importance amongst the Islamic community of al-Andalus for three centuries. In C\u00f3rdoba, the capital, the Mosque was seen as the heart and central focus of the city.  Muhammad Iqbal described its hypostyle hall as having \"countless pillars like rows of palm trees in the oases of Syria\". To the people of al-Andalus \"the beauty of the mosque was so dazzling that it defied any description.\"The main hall of the mosque was used for a variety of purposes. It served as a central Prayer hall for personal devotion, the five daily Muslim prayers and the special Friday prayers. It also would have served as a hall for teaching and for Sharia law cases during the rule of Abd al-Rahman and his successors.The Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba exhibited features and an architectural appearance similar to the Great Mosque of Damascus,  which may have been used as a model. \n\n\n=== Features ===\nThe building is most notable for its arcaded hypostyle hall, with 856 columns of jasper, onyx, marble, granite and porphyry. These were made from pieces of the Roman temple that had occupied the site previously, as well as other Roman buildings, such as the M\u00e9rida amphitheatre. The double arches were an innovation, permitting higher ceilings than would otherwise be possible with relatively low columns. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The famous alternating red and white voussoirs of the arches  were inspired by those in the Dome of the Rock and also resemble those of the Aachen Cathedral, which were built almost at the same time. Horseshoe arches were known in the Iberian Peninsula since late Antiquity, as can be seen on the 3rd-century \"Estela de los Flavios\", now in the archaeological museum of Le\u00f3n. A centrally located honeycombed dome has blue tiles decorated with stars.\nThe edifice also has a richly gilded prayer niche or mihrab. The mihrab is a masterpiece of architectural art, with geometric and flowing designs of plants. Other prominent features were an open court (sahn) surrounded by arcades, screens of wood, minarets, colourful mosaics, and windows of coloured glass.  The walls of the mosque had Quranic inscriptions written on them. As many adherents of Islam reject sculptural or pictorial representations of people or of God within religious contexts, all decoration of the cathedral is accomplished through tile work, calligraphy and architectural forms. Arrazi, an Arab writer, speaks of the valuable wine-coloured marble, obtained from the mountains of the district, which was much used in embellishing the naves of the mosque.\n\n\n=== Layout ===\nThe building's floor plan is seen to be parallel to some of the earliest mosques built from the very beginning of Islam.  It had a rectangular prayer hall with aisles arranged perpendicular to the qibla, the direction towards which Muslims pray.  The prayer hall was large and flat, with timber ceilings held up by arches of horseshoe-like appearance.Hisham's mosque covered an area of 460 by 280 feet (140 m \u00d7 85 m). It was flanked by stout, fortified walls, with watch towers and a tall minaret. There were nine outer gates and eleven inner doors. Each door led to an aisle within the mosque. The court had spacious gates on the north, west, and east sides, and fountains for the purification of the pious. The eleven north-to-south aisles were crossed by twenty-one narrower ones running from east to west.One hundred and fifty years after the mosque's creation, a staircase to the roof was added, along with a southward extension of the mosque itself. A bridge was built linking the prayer hall with the Caliph's palace.  The mosque was later expanded even further south, as was the courtyard which surrounded it. The mosque was built in four stages, with each ruler and his elite contributing to it.Until the 11th century, the courtyard was unpaved earth with citrus and palm trees irrigated \u2013 at first by rainwater cisterns, and later by aqueduct. Excavation indicates the trees were planted in a pattern, with surface irrigation channels. The stone channels visible today are not original.Abd al-Rahman III added a new tower. The minaret contained two staircases, which were built for the separate ascent and descent of the tower. On the summit there were three apples, two of gold and one of silver, with lilies of six petals. The minaret is four-faced, with fourteen windows, having arches upon jasper columns, and the structure is adorned with tracery.\n\n\n=== Chapels ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Doors ===\nWest fa\u00e7ade, along Calle Torrijos, north to south:\n\nPostigo de la leche\nPuerta de los Deanes\nPuerta de San Esteban\nPuerta de San Miguel\nPuerta del Esp\u00edritu Santo\nPostigo del Palacio\nPuerta de San Ildefonso\nPuerta del Sabat\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nEast fa\u00e7ade, along Calle del Magistrado Gonz\u00e1lez Franc\u00e9s, north to south:\n\nPuerta de la Grada Redonda\nFuente de Santa Catalina\nPuerta de Santa Catalina\nPuerta de San Juan\nPuerta del Baptisterio\nPuerta de San Nicol\u00e1s\nPuerta de la Concepci\u00f3n Antigua\nPuerta de San Jos\u00e9\nPuerta del Sagrario\nPuerta de Jerusal\u00e9n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNorth fa\u00e7ade, along calle Cardenal Herrero, west to east:\n\nPuerta del Perd\u00f3n\nPuerta del Ca\u00f1o Gordo\n\t\t\n\n\n== The Reconquista ==\n\nIn 1236, C\u00f3rdoba was conquered by King Ferdinand III of Castile, and the centre of the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral. Alfonso X oversaw the construction of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. The kings who followed added further Christian features, such as King Henry II rebuilding the chapel in the 14th century. The minaret of the mosque was also converted to the bell tower of the cathedral. It was adorned with Santiago de Compostela's captured cathedral bells. Following a windstorm in 1589, the former minaret was further reinforced by encasing it within a new structure.The most significant alteration was the building of a Renaissance cathedral nave in the middle of the expansive structure. The insertion was constructed by permission of Charles V, king of Castile and Aragon. However, when Charles V visited the completed cathedral he was displeased by the result and famously commented: \"You have destroyed something unique to build something commonplace.\"Artisans and architects continued to add to the existing structure until the late 18th century.\n\n\n== 2000s Muslim campaign ==\n\nMuslims across Spain have lobbied the Catholic Church to allow them to pray in the complex, with the Islamic Council of Spain lodging a formal request with the Vatican.  However, Spanish church authorities and the Vatican have opposed this move. These battles over the cathedral reflect the contested view of what constitutes Spanish history and Spanish identity. Battles over holy sites claimed by different faiths are also evident in Jerusalem; Istanbul, Turkey; elsewhere in pre-Reformation/post-Reformation Europe, and most recently in Ukraine, 2018, over \"the division of valuable church property\" there. Recently the diocese of Cordoba said in a statement: \"We call on politicians and institutions to show responsibility and not to feed this false controversy which merely fuels division.\" In July, 2019, the new mayor of Cordoba, Jose Maria Bellido, closed down a commission investigating ownership rights to the Visigothic cathedral, a former mosque, saying it should be reserved for Catholic worship. He noted, \"There are no administrative tasks arising from this commission and I've no intention of reactivating it.\"\n\n\n=== 2010 incident ===\nIn April 2010, two Muslim tourists were arrested at the Cathedral after violently assaulting two security guards. The incident occurred when the building was filled with tourists visiting the cathedral during Holy Week.According to cathedral authorities, when half a dozen Austrian Muslims, who were part of a group of 118 people on an organized tour for young European Muslims, knelt to pray at the same time, security guards stepped in and \"invited them to continue with their tour or leave the building\". A fight took place between two of the tourists and the security guards. The security guards suffered serious injuries and had to be hospitalised and two Muslim men were detained.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe South Asian Muslim philosopher and poet Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement, visited the Great Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba in 1931\u201332. He asked the authorities to offer adhan at the cathedral and was even allowed to offer his prayers there. The deep emotional responses that the mosque evoked in him found expression in his poem called \"The Mosque of Cordoba\". Allama Iqbal saw it as a cultural landmark of Islam and described it as:\nLouis L'Amour's The Walking Drum features a detailed description of the Court of Oranges in the 12th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAl-Andalus\nList of former mosques in Spain\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nHistory of early modern period domes\nIslamic architecture\nTimeline of Muslim history\nUmayyad Mosque of Damascus\n12 Treasures of Spain\nMuslim campaign at C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral\nList of the oldest mosques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJover B\u00e1ez, J.; Rosa, B.

        "wiki": "The Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish: Mezquita-Catedral de C\u00f3rdoba), also known as the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish: Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba) and the Mezquita, whose ecclesiastical name is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption (Spanish: Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n), is the Catholic cathedral of the Diocese of C\u00f3rdoba dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and located in the Spanish region of Andalusia. The structure is regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture.\nAccording to a traditional account, a small Visigoth church, the Catholic Basilica of Saint Vincent of L\u00e9rins, originally stood on the site. In 784 Abd al-Rahman I ordered construction of the Great Mosque, which was considerably expanded by later Muslim rulers. C\u00f3rdoba returned to Christian rule in 1236 during the Reconquista, and the building was converted to a Catholic church, culminating in the insertion of a Renaissance cathedral nave in the 16th century.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIt is commonly believed that the site of the Mosque-Cathedral was originally a Christian church dedicated to Saint Vincent the Third, which was divided and shared by Muslims and Christians after the Islamic conquest of the Visigothic kingdom. This sharing arrangement of the site lasted until 784, when the Christian half was purchased by the Emir Abd al-Rahman I, who then proceeded to demolish the original structure and build the grand mosque of C\u00f3rdoba on its ground. This narrative, which goes back to the tenth-century historian al-Razi, echoed similar narratives of the Islamic conquest of Syria, in particular the story of building the Great Mosque of Damascus. For medieval Muslim historians, these parallels served to highlight a dynastic Umayyad conquest of Spain and appropriation of the Visigothic C\u00f3rdoba. The historicity of this narrative has been challenged, as archaeological evidence is scant, and the narrative is not corroborated by contemporary accounts of the events following Abd al-Rahman I's initial arrival in al-Andalus. Another tenth-century source mentions a church that stood at the site of the mosque without giving further details. However, it is almost certain that the building which housed the original mosque was destroyed to build the first version of the Great Mosque. An archaeological exhibit in the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of Cordoba displays fragments of a Visigothic building, emphasizing an originally Christian nature of the complex. According to Susana Calvo Capilla, a specialist on the history of the Mosque\u2013Cathedral, although remains of multiple church-like buildings have been located on the territory of the Mosque-Cathedral complex, no clear archaeological evidence has been found of where either the church of St. Vincent or the first mosque were located on the site, and the latter may have been a newly constructed building. The evidence suggests that it may have been the grounds of an episcopal complex rather than a particular church which were initially divided between Muslims and Christians.\n\nAccording to a traditional account, when the exiled Umayyad prince Abd al-Rahman I escaped to Iberia and defeated the governor of Al-Andalus, Yusuf al-Fihri, he found the Cordovese divided into various sects, including the Gnostics, Priscillianists, Donatists, and Luciferians. His ambition was to erect a temple which would rival in magnificence those of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, and approach in sanctity the fame of Mecca. Above a Christian church dedicated to Saint Vincent, Abd al-Rahman decided to raise his great mosque. He offered to buy the church and the plot. The negotiations for the sale were placed in the hands of the Sultan's favourite secretary, Umeya ibn Yezid. Under the terms of the transfer, the Cordovese were permitted to reconstruct the church formerly dedicated to Saints Faustus, Januarius, and Marcellus, three Christian martyrs whom they deeply revered.\n\nAbd al-Rahman allowed the Christians to rebuild their ruined churches and purchased the Christian half of the church of St Vincent, as agreed upon in the sale terms. The Emirate was rich. Apart from the treasure wrested from the Goths during the recent wars, he also extracted a tithe upon the produce of the land and on manufactures. All able Muslims in Andalusia were asked to pay the zakat. A mandatory tax known as jizya was also laid upon only one able Christian and Jew per household in Andalusia as a precondition for services & protection provided by the government of Andalusia, unless they participated in the protection services themselves. They were one of the main sources of income for the Muslim rulers in lands occupied by Islamic tribes but populated still by Christians, to provide all needed services for all people living in the land, especially the poor. Beyond this, the Moorish kings were greatly enriched by the acquisition of the valuable mines of Iberia, the quarries of marble, and other sources of wealth. From these revenues Abd al-Rahman and his successors, Hisham, Abd-al Rahman II, the greatest of the dynasty and the third of the line, and lastly the extravagant Almanzor, lavished large sums upon the designing, construction, and costly adornment of the Mosque. Abd al-Rahman I and his descendants reworked the building over the next two centuries to fashion it as a mosque, starting in 784. Additionally, Abd al-Rahman I used the mosque (originally called Aljama Mosque) as an adjunct to his palace and named it in honour of his wife. Traditionally, the mihrab (or apse) of a mosque faces in the direction of Mecca; by facing the mihrab, worshipers pray towards Mecca. Mecca is east-southeast of the mosque, but the mihrab of this mosque unusually points south.The work of building the resplendent Mezquita employed thousands of artisans and labourers, and such a vast undertaking led to the development of all the resources of the district. Hard stone and beautifully veined marble were quarried from the Sierra Morena and the surrounding regions of the city. Metals of various kinds were dug up from the soil, and factories sprang up in C\u00f3rdoba amid the stir and bustle of an awakened industrial energy. A famous Syrian architect made the plans for the Mosque. Leaving his own house on the edge of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emir came to reside in the city, so that he might personally superintend the operations and offer proposals for the improvement of the designs. Abd al-Rahman moved about among the workers, directing them for several hours of every day.The mosque underwent numerous subsequent changes: Abd al-Rahman II ordered a new minaret, while in 961 Al-Hakam II enlarged the building and enriched the Mihrab. The last of such reforms was carried out by Almanzor in 987. It was connected to the Caliph's palace by a raised walkway, mosques within the palaces being the tradition for previous Islamic rulers \u2013 as well as Christian Kings who built their palaces adjacent to churches. The Mezquita reached its current dimensions in 987 with the completion of the outer naves and courtyard.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nIn planning the mosque, the architects incorporated a number of Roman columns with choice capitals. Some of the columns were already in the Gothic structure; others were sent from various regions of Iberia as presents from the governors of provinces. Ivory, jasper, porphyry, gold, silver, copper, and brass were used in the decorations. Marvellous mosaics and azulejos were designed. Panels of scented woods were fastened with nails of pure gold, and the red marble columns were said to be the work of God. The primitive part of the building, erected under the direction of Abd al-Rahman I., was that which borders the Court of Oranges. Later, the immense temple embodied all the styles of Morisco architecture into one composition.The Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba held a place of importance amongst the Islamic community of al-Andalus for three centuries. In C\u00f3rdoba, the capital, the Mosque was seen as the heart and central focus of the city.  Muhammad Iqbal described its hypostyle hall as having \"countless pillars like rows of palm trees in the oases of Syria\". To the people of al-Andalus \"the beauty of the mosque was so dazzling that it defied any description.\"The main hall of the mosque was used for a variety of purposes. It served as a central Prayer hall for personal devotion, the five daily Muslim prayers and the special Friday prayers. It also would have served as a hall for teaching and for Sharia law cases during the rule of Abd al-Rahman and his successors.The Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba exhibited features and an architectural appearance similar to the Great Mosque of Damascus,  which may have been used as a model. \n\n\n=== Features ===\nThe building is most notable for its arcaded hypostyle hall, with 856 columns of jasper, onyx, marble, granite and porphyry. These were made from pieces of the Roman temple that had occupied the site previously, as well as other Roman buildings, such as the M\u00e9rida amphitheatre. The double arches were an innovation, permitting higher ceilings than would otherwise be possible with relatively low columns. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The famous alternating red and white voussoirs of the arches  were inspired by those in the Dome of the Rock and also resemble those of the Aachen Cathedral, which were built almost at the same time. Horseshoe arches were known in the Iberian Peninsula since late Antiquity, as can be seen on the 3rd-century \"Estela de los Flavios\", now in the archaeological museum of Le\u00f3n. A centrally located honeycombed dome has blue tiles decorated with stars.\nThe edifice also has a richly gilded prayer niche or mihrab. The mihrab is a masterpiece of architectural art, with geometric and flowing designs of plants. Other prominent features were an open court (sahn) surrounded by arcades, screens of wood, minarets, colourful mosaics, and windows of coloured glass.  The walls of the mosque had Quranic inscriptions written on them. As many adherents of Islam reject sculptural or pictorial representations of people or of God within religious contexts, all decoration of the cathedral is accomplished through tile work, calligraphy and architectural forms. Arrazi, an Arab writer, speaks of the valuable wine-coloured marble, obtained from the mountains of the district, which was much used in embellishing the naves of the mosque.\n\n\n=== Layout ===\nThe building's floor plan is seen to be parallel to some of the earliest mosques built from the very beginning of Islam.  It had a rectangular prayer hall with aisles arranged perpendicular to the qibla, the direction towards which Muslims pray.  The prayer hall was large and flat, with timber ceilings held up by arches of horseshoe-like appearance.Hisham's mosque covered an area of 460 by 280 feet (140 m \u00d7 85 m). It was flanked by stout, fortified walls, with watch towers and a tall minaret. There were nine outer gates and eleven inner doors. Each door led to an aisle within the mosque. The court had spacious gates on the north, west, and east sides, and fountains for the purification of the pious. The eleven north-to-south aisles were crossed by twenty-one narrower ones running from east to west.One hundred and fifty years after the mosque's creation, a staircase to the roof was added, along with a southward extension of the mosque itself. A bridge was built linking the prayer hall with the Caliph's palace.  The mosque was later expanded even further south, as was the courtyard which surrounded it. The mosque was built in four stages, with each ruler and his elite contributing to it.Until the 11th century, the courtyard was unpaved earth with citrus and palm trees irrigated \u2013 at first by rainwater cisterns, and later by aqueduct. Excavation indicates the trees were planted in a pattern, with surface irrigation channels. The stone channels visible today are not original.Abd al-Rahman III added a new tower. The minaret contained two staircases, which were built for the separate ascent and descent of the tower. On the summit there were three apples, two of gold and one of silver, with lilies of six petals. The minaret is four-faced, with fourteen windows, having arches upon jasper columns, and the structure is adorned with tracery.\n\n\n=== Chapels ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Doors ===\nWest fa\u00e7ade, along Calle Torrijos, north to south:\n\nPostigo de la leche\nPuerta de los Deanes\nPuerta de San Esteban\nPuerta de San Miguel\nPuerta del Esp\u00edritu Santo\nPostigo del Palacio\nPuerta de San Ildefonso\nPuerta del Sabat\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nEast fa\u00e7ade, along Calle del Magistrado Gonz\u00e1lez Franc\u00e9s, north to south:\n\nPuerta de la Grada Redonda\nFuente de Santa Catalina\nPuerta de Santa Catalina\nPuerta de San Juan\nPuerta del Baptisterio\nPuerta de San Nicol\u00e1s\nPuerta de la Concepci\u00f3n Antigua\nPuerta de San Jos\u00e9\nPuerta del Sagrario\nPuerta de Jerusal\u00e9n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNorth fa\u00e7ade, along calle Cardenal Herrero, west to east:\n\nPuerta del Perd\u00f3n\nPuerta del Ca\u00f1o Gordo\n\t\t\n\n\n== The Reconquista ==\n\nIn 1236, C\u00f3rdoba was conquered by King Ferdinand III of Castile, and the centre of the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral. Alfonso X oversaw the construction of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. The kings who followed added further Christian features, such as King Henry II rebuilding the chapel in the 14th century. The minaret of the mosque was also converted to the bell tower of the cathedral. It was adorned with Santiago de Compostela's captured cathedral bells. Following a windstorm in 1589, the former minaret was further reinforced by encasing it within a new structure.The most significant alteration was the building of a Renaissance cathedral nave in the middle of the expansive structure. The insertion was constructed by permission of Charles V, king of Castile and Aragon. However, when Charles V visited the completed cathedral he was displeased by the result and famously commented: \"You have destroyed something unique to build something commonplace.\"Artisans and architects continued to add to the existing structure until the late 18th century.\n\n\n== 2000s Muslim campaign ==\n\nMuslims across Spain have lobbied the Catholic Church to allow them to pray in the complex, with the Islamic Council of Spain lodging a formal request with the Vatican.  However, Spanish church authorities and the Vatican have opposed this move. These battles over the cathedral reflect the contested view of what constitutes Spanish history and Spanish identity. Battles over holy sites claimed by different faiths are also evident in Jerusalem; Istanbul, Turkey; elsewhere in pre-Reformation/post-Reformation Europe, and most recently in Ukraine, 2018, over \"the division of valuable church property\" there. Recently the diocese of Cordoba said in a statement: \"We call on politicians and institutions to show responsibility and not to feed this false controversy which merely fuels division.\" In July, 2019, the new mayor of Cordoba, Jose Maria Bellido, closed down a commission investigating ownership rights to the Visigothic cathedral, a former mosque, saying it should be reserved for Catholic worship. He noted, \"There are no administrative tasks arising from this commission and I've no intention of reactivating it.\"\n\n\n=== 2010 incident ===\nIn April 2010, two Muslim tourists were arrested at the Cathedral after violently assaulting two security guards. The incident occurred when the building was filled with tourists visiting the cathedral during Holy Week.According to cathedral authorities, when half a dozen Austrian Muslims, who were part of a group of 118 people on an organized tour for young European Muslims, knelt to pray at the same time, security guards stepped in and \"invited them to continue with their tour or leave the building\". A fight took place between two of the tourists and the security guards. The security guards suffered serious injuries and had to be hospitalised and two Muslim men were detained.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe South Asian Muslim philosopher and poet Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement, visited the Great Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba in 1931\u201332. He asked the authorities to offer adhan at the cathedral and was even allowed to offer his prayers there. The deep emotional responses that the mosque evoked in him found expression in his poem called \"The Mosque of Cordoba\". Allama Iqbal saw it as a cultural landmark of Islam and described it as:\nLouis L'Amour's The Walking Drum features a detailed description of the Court of Oranges in the 12th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAl-Andalus\nList of former mosques in Spain\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nHistory of early modern period domes\nIslamic architecture\nTimeline of Muslim history\nUmayyad Mosque of Damascus\n12 Treasures of Spain\nMuslim campaign at C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral\nList of the oldest mosques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJover B\u00e1ez, J.; Rosa, B.

          "Boy....those Catholics sure know how to build MAGNIFICENT churches! Breathtaking stain glass, 3 organs, baptism area and beautiful wooden sanctuary. You could spend hours in there. Very peaceful and calm. May want to call first-we just barely made it in to see since we",

          "I took some out-of-town visitors to look at the Basilica's stained glass windows. Not only are the windows magnificent, but the entire interior of the building is just beautiful. The wood-working is amazing. The Basilica may not be nearly as large as some European cathedrals,",
          "Have only seen a few basilica's since I have not been to Italy, but am glad we took a detour to see this stunning church, there is a wonder pamphlet telling you about the history of this church and the details of the masonry brought in from Italy, if you are on the way to",
          "To say we were wowed by this place is so much of an understatement that it is difficult to believe.This was lavish yet wonderfully tasteful, with superlative workmanship that would not be out of place in Europe. The ultimate compliment is that I would go back tomorrow if I",

          "This building is a reproduction of Notre Dame in Paris. Get a look at Europe in the US. Inside there are two Duvenick Paints he lived down the street. If like visiting Church go to 6th and Washington and visit Mother of God Church the stain glass is fabulous and the painting is",
          "It's a must see, we went during mass so had to be respectful. But the inside is just as stunning. Even my teen daughter was taking pictures. Definitely wort it just to see the eerie gargoyles lookin down at you.",
          "I thought it was the outside facade that would get to me, but going inside and spending hours was just phenomenal. ONLY thing is I wish their small folded brochure gave more in depth detail on some of the artifacts. Other than that just absolutely worth the visit and the time",

          "The third largest pictorial window in the world, the entire cathedral is covered with stained glass that you can't take your eyes away from watching. You must though, because the stations of the cross are intricate mosiac tile and you only realize that when you get close to",
          "The Cathedral was started in 1895 and patterned after Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The exterior is French Gothic and is guarded by plenty of gargoyles. The cathedral has the largest church stained glass in the world as well as the first and third largest rose stained glass.",

          "Covington has a plethora of beautiful churches. This one is the crown jewel. With stained glass that awes and beautiful sweeping gothic architecture, it's easy to be swept back to the late 19th century when ground was broken for this amazing structure. You will not want to",
          "Not to be missed if you're in Greater Cincinnati. Duveneck art, the largest free-standing stained glass window. 80% of the wall surfaces are stained glass. Marble through out. Stations of the Cross are in mosaic, a must see. The Cathedral Gardens are a great place to find",
          "I am a local who attends church here several times a month. I can verify that it is possibly one of the nicest Catholic churches that I have been in, including those in Europe. A little known fact is that the Cathedral Basilica facade was designed after the Notre Dame Cathedral",

          "It has been a long time since I was inside the church, but I grew up in the neighborhood and in the 60's it was said that St. Mary's had the second largest round stained glass windows in the world, the largest being in a church in France. It is a beautiful church.",
          "While in Cincinnati to run the Flying Pig Half Marathon, we attended Mass on a Saturday night. This is a warm, welcoming, beautiful Church. Even though it is a Cathedral, it feels small and intimate. The stained glass windows are breathtaking. This Church is well worth a visit",
          "We stopped here on our way out of town over Spring Break and it did not disappoint! The lady at the sign in table gave us a guide to the chapels and stained glass and we took nearly 1 hour to take it all in slowly. My children were enthralled. Very beautiful!",

          "Religious or not, you will enjoy the spectacular beauty of this cathedral. It is only a few minutes off of I-75 as you head through Covinington, so it is certainly worth detouring off the expressway and visiting for as little or as long as you'd like. It is free - a donation",
          "I have visited the Basilica twice, the first with my husband and just this past weekend with my mother. It is absolutely beautiful and absolutely breathtaking. I could have spent hours just taking in it's beauty. The guides are very knowledgeable and I learned things that I did",
          "Spectacular church with an hour's worth of photogenic stained glass windows, statues, paintings, and fixtures. Be sure to include the adoration chapel in the right front corner with murals by noted artist Frank Duveneck (October 9, 1848 \u2013 January 3, 1919) born in Covington. He",

          "A real gem in an urban setting struggeling to find its identity. This architectural beauty would be a start on the list of \"nust sees\". It's a mini Notre Dame. Stained glass wraps you in timeless beauty.",
          "Clean and elegant. Side chapel for adoration is a great space for quiet prayer. Windows and statues are first class. Homilies are usually better than average.",
          "Absolutely beautiful! The stained glass windows alone are worth a visit. The view of a Church building that it beautiful enough to be a museum but it is used every day as a parish church and functions as such. Attending Mass at the Cathedral is awe-inspiring. Frank Duveneck",
          "Definitely worth the trip! This lovely church is just a short ways from Cincinnati. Staff on hand were very informative, which adds to your appreciation of this intricately built wonder. The mosaic pictures (14 stations of the cross ) are simply marvelous. The hand carved",

          "Lovely City! You cannot say anything bad about it, awesome for anyone. Hotel's on Ohio River in Covington & Walk over to Cincinnati! So much to see within a ten mile radius. Don't miss Newport on the Levee, which is just a few miles away! So awesome and you can walk over",

          "Don't pass up the chance to see this beautiful church. We were surprised to find such a gem in a relatively small city. The stained glass, mosaics, woodworking, marble, and architecture are something I wouldn't have expected to see outside of Boston or New York!",

          "Like visiting a Basilica in Europe. Enjoy the beautiful stained glass",
          "This is a 1/3 scale replica of Notre Dame in Paris, France and it is well worth seeing. If you go to the 10:00 AM Sunday Mass (their high liturgy) you will probably have Bishop Foys as your celebrant for the Mass and tours after are usually available. It is a beautiful",
          "I would go here again. My family dreaded it when I told them we were spending two hours at a church as part of our vacation (I'm someone who plans the entire vacation out). At the end of the two hours I'd estimated we'd spend there they didn't want to leave. If you've never been",

          "As a photographer and Artist this was a great place to be inspired both spiritually as well as Artistically.",
          "We always stop here when going to Covington/Newport area. The cathedral is a serene stop and the art, stained glass and sculptures are breathtaking (people going to Europe often spend a great majority of their time touring churches for the same reason- why not here in America?)",
          "Touring the Basilica is a wonderful experience, especially for individuals who enjoy art. Like wonderful places in every city, many locals have never been here. I\u2019m sure that might have to do with it being a church, and if you are not Catholic you might think you would feel",
          "We didn't really expect to find a European style major basilica in this city. It is worth a visit.",

        "wiki": "Molfetta  (Italian: [mol\u02c8fetta]; Molfettese: Melf\u00e9tte) is a town located in the northern side of the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy.\nIt has a well restored old city, and its own dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest local signs of permanent habitation are at the Neolithic site of Pulo, one of the most important such sites in southern Italy. The origins of the city can be traced to a small fishing port; antique graves testify to a fisherman's village in the fourth century BC. The position of the future city offered a valid landing to the commerce of Roman Rubo. The first indication of a toponym on the coast between Turenum (Trani) and Natiolum (Giovinazzo) is in the Itinerarium Provinciarum Antonini Augusti, edited from a third-century core. The place denominated Respa was probably a wrong transcript of the toponym Melpha, referring to a small village of fishermen.\nThe first official document that mentions the city dates to November 925; it documents a civitas denominated Melfi, situated on a peninsula named Sant'Andrea. The city developed under Byzantine dominion, and was later conquered by the Lombards, who included it in the Duchy of Benevento. The city repelled repeated assaults by the Saracens. As an independent seaport, Molfetta traded with other Mediterranean markets, including Venice, Alexandria, Constantinople, Syria, Amalfi and Ragusa.\nAt the beginning of the 11th century the Normans arrived, and the autonomy that the city preserved helped foster its development as both a commercial port with the east, and as port of embarcation for pilgrims heading to the Holy Land. The Crusades  permitted the city to assume a wider importance. Among the many pilgrims was Conrad of Bavaria, who was so enamoured of the city that he became venerated as San Corrado, the protecting saint of Molfetta. During the Angevin dominion the city succeeded in remaining autonomous. However, the arrival of the Aragonese kingdom to Southern Italy, spurred turbulent struggles between French, Spanish and Italians. These wars provoked death and destruction in the whole south of Italy: the Sack of Molfetta at the hands of the French, 18\u201319 July 1529, was an episode that stalled the economic rebirth of the city.\nIn February 2006, Molfetta hosted International Youth Parliament, an event which took place the previous year in Canterbury.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated in the north-western corner of its province, near the borders with the one of Barletta-Andria-Trani, and by the Adriatic Coast, Molfetta borders with the municipalities of Bisceglie (BT), Giovinazzo, Terlizzi and Ruvo di Puglia. The town is 27 km from Andria, 31 from Barletta and 34 from Bari.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nIl Pulo is one of the most important Neolithic sites of southern Italy. It is a circular cave 23 metres (75 ft) deep with grottoes and remains of old constructions.\nThe Old Cathedral (it:Duomo di San Corrado) was built in the twelfth\u2013thirteenth centuries in Apulian-Romanesque style, using local stone on a basilica plan, a nave with two aisles divided by four central cross-shaped pilasters.  The floor has two domes.  From the apse area rise two 20-metre (66 ft) towers, one of which acted as watchtower, the other has the usual campanile. The interior has some notable religious furnishings from the sixteenth century\nSeveral watchtowers, such as the Torre Calderina (fifteenth century) on the seaside, and the Torrione Passari, inglobated in the town's walls.\nThe New Cathedral, or church of S. Maria Assunta in Cielo, was built by the Jesuits from 1610. It houses the remains of the city's patron, San Corrado of Bavaria, in a silver reliquary bust of the saint (seventeenth century) by G. Todaro.\nThe church of San Bernardino da Siena (1451, rebuilt in 1585) includes a triptych by Duccio d'Andrea (fifteenth century) and other later paintings. Notable is the Renaissance choir. The annexed convent is now the Palazzo Civico (town hall).\nThe church of Santo Stefano, built from 1286, but with a Renaissance stone fa\u00e7ade added in 1586.\nPalazzo Giovene is a 16th-century palace, now used as Town Hall. It has a notable Renaissance style portal\nThe church of Santa Maria Consolatrice degli Afflitti, simply known as Chiesa del Purgatorio, dating from 1643 and consecrated in 1667. The fa\u00e7ade has statues representing Sts. Stephen, Peter, Paul and  Lawrence and, on the two side summits, those of St. Joaquim and St. Anne. The interior houses paintings by Bernardo Cavallino and native-son Corrado Giaquinto.\nThe church of San Pietro Apostolo, simply called \"San Pietro's Church\", just existing in the twelfth century, but with the actual Baroque fa\u00e7ade and bell tower, situated in the old town, at the begin of the street of the some name, near the Municipio Square.\nThe Temple of Calvary, a small Neo-Gothic construction built in 1856 and designed by the local architect Corrado De Judicibus.\nTwo km outside the city in the direction of Bisceglie, is the basilica-sanctuary of the Madonna dei Martiri. The current nave of the church is partially built over the old eleventh-century church, of which only a dome and the underlying structure remain, in today's altar area. Annexed is the Crusaders Hospital, also from the eleventh century.  The basilica conserves an image that was a votive gift of some Crusaders in 1188.\nThe lighthouse\n\n\n== People ==\nPersonalities from Molfetta include the Rococo painter Corrado Giaquinto, the 19th-cenrury composer Luigi Capotorti, the anti-fascist politician and writer Gaetano Salvemini, the assassinated magistrate Girolamo Minervini, the conductor Riccardo Muti, Cardinal Angelo Amato, goalkeeper Vitangelo Spadavecchia, artist Rossella Biscotti, the rapper Caparezza, and Domenico Leccisi, who is best known for stealing the corpse of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini from an unmarked grave.\n\n\n== Migration ==\nDuring the times of the mass migration of Italians, mainly following World War II, many Molfettese residents migrated to a town in South Australia called Port Pirie. The culture of Molfetta is celebrated in Port Pirie and officials of both Port Pirie and Molfetta have close links today. In the United States, many Molfettese immigrants settled in the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, where a substantial enclave still exists today.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2014 sister cities ==\nMolfetta is twinned with:\n\n G\u00f6rlitz, Germany (1971)\n Fremantle, Australia (1984)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMolfetta railway station\nMolfetta Lighthouse\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Italian)\nCatholic Encyclopedia: \"Molfetta, Terlizzi and Giovinazzo\"",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Castel del Monte (Italian for \"Castle of the Mountain\"; Barese: Cast\u00eddde d'u Monte) is a 13th-century citadel and castle situated on a hill in Andria in the Apulia region of southeast Italy. It was built during the 1240s by the Emperor Frederick II, who had inherited the lands from his mother Constance of Sicily. In the 18th century, the castle's interior marbles and remaining furnishings were removed. It has neither a moat nor a drawbridge and some considered it never to have been intended as a defensive fortress; however, archaeological work has suggested that it originally had a curtain wall. Described by the Enciclopedia Italiana as \"the most fascinating castle built by Frederick II\", the site is protected as a World Heritage Site. It also appears on the Italian version of the one cent Euro coin.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nCastel del Monte is situated on a small hill close to the monastery of Santa Maria del Monte, at an altitude of 540 m. When the castle was built, the region was famously fertile with a plentiful supply of water and lush vegetation. It lies in the comune of Andria, province of Barletta-Andria-Trani, occupying the site of an earlier fortress of which no structural remains exist.\nThe castle's construction is mentioned in only one contemporary source, a document dating to 1240, in which the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II ordered the governor of Capitanata to finish some works in it. It was never finished and there is no proof that the emperor used it as a hunting lodge as commonly stated. It was later turned into a prison, used as a refuge during a plague, and finally fell into disrepair. It originally had marble walls and columns, but all were stripped by vandals or re-used in  constructions nearby.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nBecause of its relatively small size, it was once considered to be no more than a \"hunting lodge\", but scholars now believe it originally had a curtain wall and did serve as a citadel. Frederick was responsible for the construction of many castles in Apulia, but Castel del Monte's geometric design was unique. The fortress is an octagonal prism with an octagonal tower at each corner. The towers were originally some 5 m higher than now, and they should perhaps include a third floor. Both floors have eight rooms and an eight-sided courtyard occupies the castle's centre. Each of the main rooms has vaulted ceilings. Three of the corner towers contain staircases. The castle has two entrances, an unobtrusive service entrance and an ornate main entrance. Frederick's main entrance featured elements from classical design, and may have been influenced by Frederick's interest in Greco-Roman architecture.\n\nThe octagonal plan is unusual in castle design. Historians have debated the purpose of the building and it has been suggested that it was intended as a hunting lodge. Another theory is that the octagon is an intermediate symbol between a square (representing the earth) and a circle (representing the sky). Frederick II may have been inspired to build to this shape by either the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which he had seen during the Sixth Crusade, or by the Palatine Chapel of Aachen Cathedral.\nOccasionally used as a hunting lodge under Manfred of Sicily, the castle become a state prison under the latter's victor, Charles I of Anjou: here Manfred's sons Henry, Azzo and Enzo were kept as prisoner after 1266, as well as other Hohenstaufen supportersThe main wall is 25 m high and the eight bastions each 26 m. The sides of the main octagon are 16.5 m long and those of the octagonal towers each 3.1 m. The castle has a diameter of 56 m. Its main entrance faces east.\n\n\n== Modern era ==\nIn the 18th century, the castle's marbles and other ornamentation were looted. Members of the House of Bourbon took the marble columns and window frames and reused them at their palace in Caserta. What remains now includes fragments of a knight and a re-used Roman relief, while in the Provincial Gallery of Bari there are a head fragment and a cloaked, headless bust, sometimes interpreted as Frederick II. After having been abandoned for a considerable length of time, the castle was purchased in 1876 for the sum of 25,000 lire by the Italian State, which began the process of restoration in 1928.During the Allied occupation of WWII, the 15th Army Air Force headquartered a secret navigational aid station called Big Fence at the Castel.\nIn the 1950s, soil around the castle was discovered to contain a bright red compound produced by a strain of the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. Scientists named the drug daunorubicin and further development identified a related compound doxorubicin that finds use as a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat cancer.Central to the plot of Umberto Eco's novel The Name of the Rose is an old fortress known as the 'Aedificium'.  This was almost certainly inspired by Castel del Monte. It was also the set for the film Tale of Tales.\nIn 1996 Castel del Monte was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, which described it as \"a unique masterpiece of medieval military architecture\".Castel del Monte is depicted on the reverse of the Italian-issue 1 Euro cent coin.\nThe castle has been often mistakenly linked to the Knights Templar and it's been regarded as a \"mysterious\" construction even by notable historians. Italian historian Raffaele Licinio often condemned those esoteric views and interpretations, stressing that Castel del Monte was just one of the castles of the fortification system developed by Frederick II, and it is not in any way linked to the Templars.\n\n\n== Castel del Monte DOC ==\nAround the castle, Andria is the Italian DOC wine region of Castel del Monte that produces red, white and rose wines. Most of the wines are blends but varietal wines can be produced as long as at least 90% of the wine is composed of the same grape. The reds are usually a blend of 65-100% Uva di Troia, up to 35% of Sangiovese, Montepulciano, Pinot noir and Aglianico. The roses include 65-100% Uva di Troia and/or Bombino nero with the other red grape varieties filling out the rest. The whites are composed mainly of Pampanuto (65-100%) with other local white grape varieties filling out the rest. Red and rose grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 14 tonnes/ha and must make a wine with a minimum of 12% alcohol level (11% in the case of rose). White wine grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 15 tonnes/ha and must make a wine with a minimum alcohol of 11%. If the wine is to be labeled a Riserva, the wine must be aged at least two years with one of those years in oak/wood and must have a minimum alcohol level of 12.5%.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCastex, Jean (2008), Architecture of Italy, ABC-CLIO, ISBN 978-0-313-32086-6\nHaft, Adele J.; White, Robert J.

          "Building was nice, so one star for that. But if I could turn back time I would definitely not go. It's VERY touristic. We waited in line for at least one hour. Opening times were from 10.15 (April) and we were there at 11. Lots of big \u2026",
          "The place is great.  But we paid a guided tour with a bald guide who spoke very fast and with little volume.  Nor did he wait for everyone to get to each room.",
          "A true masterpiece of architecture. Interior spaces are totally deserted, there is nothing remarkable inside. Next time I would skip going in and would just enjoy the beauty of this castle from the outside. Also the restoration of the \u2026",
          "One of the greatest sights in this part of Italy.  You park by the main road and then there is maybe a 10 minute walk up. You can also take the shuttle. While the castle is impressive you won't miss that much if you skip the inside.",
          "Normal ticket is 10\u20ac, reduced is 3,5\u20ac. You can take nice pictures on the inner octagonal courtyard. During summer season you have to leave your car quite far and walk up the hill several hundred meters.",
          "Superb, extraordinary place - the monastry where the movie - im Namen der Rose  by Umberto Ecco has been made. Built arr. 1240 a. D. by Friedrich II (Staufer emperior). Simply fantastico \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "The castle was built in the 13th century by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. The castle is an octagonal prism with an octagonal tower at each corner. It is very attractive from the outside, but when you enter you may be disappointed. \u2026",

          "Its a long trip for an expensive (10E) tour of a small empty castle. The building itself is interesting and quirky but over hyped in a Dan Brown sort of way. Its interconnecting rooms on two levels are all identical so the building produces \u2026",
          "They ask money for everything, parking, shuttle, entrance.... and a lot! Very impressive castle but you\u2019ll leave with a lighter wallet",
          "10 eu full entrance, way too expensive for what is given. You have to pay 5eu for the parking when it is an opened zone. Then you still have to walk uphill to reach the base of the castle. It is not worth it, not for the price at least.",
          "A great masterpiece of Italian culture (you know the 1 \u20accent coin? It's Castel del Monte!), a must-visit place. You definitely need a guided tour to properly appreciate all the small details of the \"Castle\".",
          "Interesting Castle. Definitely worth a visit. But paying for a parking place (5 Euro) and then having  to pay dir a Shuttle Bus (apart from 10 euro entrance fee) is overdoing it while working to reduce the italian deficit.",
          "Interesting castle, the entrance ticket a bit expensive, but the interiors were anyway amazing... And the outer view was awesome.",
          "Beautiful and odd castle. With its unusual construction, in the form of octagon. You can visit the 8 large rooms that are on each of the two floors. It also has a patio, not as spacious as you would expect. The ascent to the upper floor is \u2026",

          "Amazing views with a great cafe",
          "Great place, huge history behind the castle. It's possible to recognize how far was the place from the nearest town during the middle age. The experience and impact you face is astonishing but pay attention to the several costs: it has been created a huge business for Castel del Monte. Please improve parking and tour prices. Thx",
          "Very nice views from the castle, is worth the visit.",
          "Top location to visit in the happening to a journey through Apulia region. It\u2019s a pity a lot of garbage everywhere which makes it sad to see a ticket is to be payed for such a dirt around. Furthermore many apparently maintenance employees \u2026",

          "Not really worths a visit. 5eur parking, 1eur shuttle bus, 7eur entrance, two etages, nothing inside, only pictures of birds. Not even a view... Overpriced souveniers available in the tiny gift shop. Unesco? Really? Nice walk though.",
          "Quite touristic, even in off-season.",
          "Around the sunset time the view is stuning!!!",

          "Impressive castle, great views, nicely renovated... But it rather lacks contents. The story of Federico II is fascinating, but a better presentation is necessary in the lack of historic artefactos.",

          "Went as part of a tour of Italy, 38 degrees day we visited and quite frankly not worth the money or the effort to get there, empty castle, views okay but expensive",
          "The castle itself is beautiful, however the inside could be a lot more interesting. All the rooms are the same trapezoid shape, but there's nothing in those rooms to bring the history alive. It just feels like walking through the same rooms \u2026",
          "Beautiful views!! Breathtaking in fact",
          "Lovely spot, but inside nothing special. Not worth the money. Outside beautiful building and view.",

          "Awesome castle. Great views. A must visit in Puglia.",
          "It's a castle on a hill.. No. It's more than that.. It's a octagonal beautiful white stoned monster of a castle on a great mound in the beautiful and great Alta Murgia park. Lots of history, lots of view!!",
          "Nice view.",
          "can be seen by 4km before arriving there ! This castle is on top of a hill surrounded by olive trees !  the scenario is amazing and the form of the castle makes it even more mysterious ! i doubt there is a way to get there with public \u2026",

          "Audioguide is worth buying if you want explanations because there is no much information in English in the castle",

          "A Unesco World Heritage site.  Worth a visit and well worth booking an English speaking guide.  You can easily self guide but the information is not as good and for that alone I'm giving 4 stars intead of 5.  View from the top is fantastic.",
          "Nice view and great road and access. Not suitable for wheelchairs - too many steps. Friendly staff speaking English and French.",

          "Awesome place",
          "There isn't anything to do around. Not much entertainment.",
          "Total waste of time and money. It is okay to climb the hill for free, but 10\u20ac admission fee was totally wasted money. Nothing interesting is seen from up above, the castle interiors contain painted birds and random texts on falcon hunt.",

          "Its a pity you cannot go to the roof, views great front he hill",

          "Castel del Monte was cloaked in clouds when we arrived.\n\nVery fittingly, that we found this Unesco World Heritage castle, built by Frederick II in 1240, veiled in mist, since the function of this beautiful octagonal structure is also \u2026",

          "It is beyond me how such an amazing monument is not famous all over the world. Perfectly maintained, surprising and unique this place is well worth the visit. If you have an answer to the mystery of its purpose, let us know!",

          "Even if all the interior was taken away (18th cent.), the aura of the naked 13th cent. building is still fantastic: walking around the \"endless\" sequence of rooms, it wouldn't be a surprise to meet the owner Friedrich II suddenly... Sitting \u2026",
          "Very small castle, not worth 10euro.",

        "wiki": "The  Pontifical Basilica di San Nicola (Basilica of Saint Nicholas) is a church in Bari, southern Italy that holds wide religious significance throughout Europe and the Christian world. The basilica is an important pilgrimage destination both for Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians from Eastern Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe basilica was built between 1087 and 1197, during the Italo-Norman domination of Apulia, the area previously occupied by the Byzantine Catapan of which Bari was the seat. Its foundation is related to the recovery of some of the relics of Saint Nicholas from the saint\u2019s original shrine in Myra, in what is now Turkey.  When Myra passed into the hands of the Saracens, some saw it as an opportunity to move the saint's relics to a safer location.  According to the justifying legend, the saint, passing by the city on his way to Rome, had chosen Bari as his burial place.  There was great competition for the relics between Venice and Bari. The latter won, the relics were carried off under the noses of the lawful Greek custodians and their Muslim masters, and on May 9, 1087, were safely landed at Bari.  A new church was built to shelter Nicholas' remains and Pope Urban II was present at the consecration of the crypt in 1089.  The edifice was officially consecrated in 1197, in the presence of the Imperial Vicar, Bishop Conrad of Hildesheim, and of numerous bishops, prelates and noblemen.  Elias, abbot of the nearby monastery of Saint Benedict, was named as first archbishop. His cathedra (bishop's throne) still stands in the church. Mediaval Serbian dynasty Nemanjic were significant donors as well.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church has a rather square appearance, seemingly more suited to a castle than to a church. This impression is strengthened by the presence of two low massive towers framing the fa\u00e7ade. It was indeed used several times as castle during its history.\nThe interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by granite columns and pilasters. The presbytery is separated from the rest of the edifice by mean of three arches supported by columns of Byzantine influence. Above the aisles is the matronaeum, a tribune gallery for women, opening into the nave. The basilica was the first church of this design, setting a precedent which was later imitated in numerous other constructions in the region.\n\n\n== Treasures ==\n\nThe Basilica houses one of the most noteworthy Romanesque sculptural works of southern Italy, a cathedra (bishop's throne) finished in the late eleventh century for Elias. There are precious mosaic pavements in the crypt and presbytery. The ciborium, the most ancient in the region, is also decorated with mosaic; it has four columns with foliage, animals and mythological figures. The crypt, with 26 columns sporting capitals in Byzantine and Romanesque style, houses the relics of Saint Nicholas.\n\nIn the church there is a Renaissance tomb of the Queen of Poland, Bona Sforza (from the 16th century), from marble. The Museum of the Basilica has valuable works of art, including a collection of twelfth-century candelabras donated by King Charles I of Anjou.\nThe church was restored in the late thirteenth century, in 1456 and in the seventeenth century. In the twentieth-century restoration, most of the Baroque additions were removed, leaving only the gilded wooden ceiling, enframing canvases by Carlo De Rosa.\n\n\n== Feast days ==\nDecember 6 is Saint Nicholas Day, the main feast day of Saint Nicholas. On this day, it is traditional for the clergy of the basilica to lower a flask into the subterranean tomb of Saint Nicholas to extract some of the myrrh which is believed to exude from the relics.  Containers of this myrrh are sent all over the world, and believers have reported numerous miracles as a result of being anointed with it.  For those Orthodox Churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, December 6 falls on December 19 of the Gregorian Calendar, so there will actually be two celebrations of the same holy day: one according to the New Calendar (December 6) and one according to the Old Calendar (December 19). Both are celebrated with great solemnity at Bari.\nMay 9 (May 22) is celebrated annually in the Russian Orthodox Church as the feast day of the \"Translation of the Relics of Saint Nicholas from Myra to Bari\". \nPilgrimages to the basilica from Eastern Europe have increased dramatically since the fall of the Iron Curtain, not only for the feast days, but throughout the year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMain sights in Bari\nCathedral of Acquaviva delle Fonti\nCathedral of Altamura\nSanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBasilica's official website",

          "It's a plain, spare church. Unless you're really, really religious, I'd give this place a pass. Nothing much to see here that can't be seen in thousands of other typical churches throughout Europe. Not bad, just completely unexceptional.",

          "The church is quite raw and without ceiling. You can see also the crypt. The visit includes underground which is showing old foundations and some old parts of construction. Cathedral is free but underground ticket costs 3EUR but it is worth to see it.",
          "Another jewel of Sicilian/Norman architecture, thankfully left undefiled by the baroque fanatics of the 17th and 18th centuries. Well worth a visit.",
          "Although the Basilica San Nicola has the edge, this is another magnificent building, full of atmosphere and interest. Do go out of the S aisle door for good views of the south side, and the Bishop's palace,",
          "I am a seminarian studying in Rome, so every now and then I take a weekend trip to other areas of Italy/Europe that have historical religious significance. It was nice to pray at the Cathedral. We met up with the Pastor of the Parish nearby and he was very helpful in showing us",

          "This 12-13th century Cathedral, although not as impressive as the San-Nicola Basilica, is definitely worth a visit. Especially its magnificent crypt happens to be open during your visit (sigh). Its elegant facade, mixing Roman and Gothic styles is matched by the equally mixed",
          "Romanesque church from 13th century. Simple fa\u00e7ade (just as Basilica), rather simple and uninspiring interior. But the real treasure of the cathedral is hidden underground - it's the beatiful crypt housing the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.",

          "Very beautiful church with an amazing history. I won't repeat what others have said only to add that there is a self guided tour you can do in the basement where they have excavated what existed before the present church was built. There are mosaics back to the first century",

          "The 1100's cathedral has been modified over the centuries, yet we'll preserved. The prize is the excavations underneath, from Roman up through the Christian centuries. The mosaics floors are a treat. Be sure not to miss the small section of the road that led from Rome to Lecce.",

        "wiki": "Bari ( BAR-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ba\u02d0ri] (listen); Barese: Bare [\u02c8b\u00e6\u02d0r\u0259]; Latin: Barium; Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, romanized: B\u00e1rion) is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia  region, on the Adriatic Sea, in southern Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples (and the third after Palermo, if Insular Italy is included), a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of 320,257 inhabitants, over 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), while the  urban area has 750,000 inhabitants. The metropolitan area has 1.3 million inhabitants.\nBari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, the Cathedral of San Sabino (1035\u20131171) and the Hohenstaufen Castle built for Frederick II, which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district (the via Sparano and via Argiro).\nModern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s. The city has a redeveloped airport, Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, with connections to several European cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe city was probably founded by the Peucetii. The city had strong Greek influences and once it passed under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were dependent on the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter the devastations of the Gothic Wars, under Longobard rule a set of written regulations was established, the Consuetudines Barenses, which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities. Until the arrival of the Normans, Bari continued to be governed by the Longobards and Byzantines, with only occasional interruption.\nThroughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major slave depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in Slavic slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by Venice from Dalmatia, the Holy Roman Empire from what is now Prussia and Poland, and the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Fatimid Caliphate (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba Mamluks).For 20 years, Bari was the centre of the Emirate of Bari; the city was captured by its first emirs Kalfun in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by Radelchis I of Benevento. The city was conquered and the Emirate extinguished in 871, due to the efforts of Emperor Louis II and a Byzantine fleet. Chris Wickham states Louis spent five years campaigning to reduce then occupy Bari, \"and then only to a Byzantine/Slav naval blockade\"; \"Louis took the credit\" for the success, adding \"at least in Frankish eyes\", then concludes by noting that by remaining in southern Italy long after this success, he \"achieved the near-impossible: an alliance against him of the Beneventans, Salernitans, Neapolitans and Spoletans; later sources include Sawad\u0101n as well.\" In 885, Bari became the residence of the local Byzantine catapan, or governor. The failed revolt (1009\u20131011) of the Lombard nobles Melus of Bari and his brother-in-law Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the Battle of Cannae (1018), offered their Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted \"provincial\" status.\nIn 1071, Bari was captured by Robert Guiscard, following a three-year siege. Maio of Bari (died 1160), a Lombard merchant's son, was the third of the great admirals of Norman Sicily. The Basilica di San Nicola was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from Myra in Lycia, in Byzantine territory. The saint began his development from Saint Nicholas of Myra into Saint Nicholas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the economy of Bari. In 1095 Peter the Hermit preached the first crusade there. In October 1098, Urban II, who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the Council of Bari, one of a series of synods convoked with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the filioque clause in the Creed, which Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the Great Schism was inevitable.\nA civil war broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by Grimoald Alferanites, a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with Byzantium and Venice and taken the title gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to Roger II of Sicily, but rebelled and was defeated in 1132.\nBari was occupied by Manuel I Komnenos between 1155 and 1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nIsabella d\u2019Aragona, princess of Naples and widow of the Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, enlarged the castle, which she made her residence, 1499\u20131524. After the death of Queen Bona Sforza, of Poland, Bari came to be included in the Kingdom of Naples and its history contracted to a local one, as malaria became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist grid plan, which bears his name today as the Murattiano. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of Mussolini can be seen in the imposing architecture along the seafront.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 11 September 1943, in connection with the Armistice of Cassibile, Bari was taken without resistance by the British 1st Airborne Division, then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.\nThe Balkan Air Force supporting the Yugoslav partisans was based at Bari.\n\n\n==== The 1943 chemical warfare disaster ====\n\nThrough a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in World War II, Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience chemical warfare in the course of that war.\nOn the night of 2 December 1943, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacked the port of Bari, which was a key supply centre for Allied forces fighting their way up the Italian Peninsula. Over 20 Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship John Harvey, which was carrying mustard gas; mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport (the chemical agent was intended for retaliation if German forces had initiated chemical warfare.) The presence of the gas was highly classified and the U.S. had not informed the British military authorities in the city of its existence. This increased the number of fatalities, since British physicians\u2014who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas\u2014prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties, many additional casualties were caused among the rescuers, through contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.\nFollowing the attack, the harbor was closed for operations for three weeks and it did not return to full capacity until February 1944.\nA member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid.  Alexander had trained at the Army's Edgewood Arsenal in New Jersey, and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the John Harvey, and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, Mustine.On the orders of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book Disaster at Bari. Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: \"[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen\". Others put the count as high as \"more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians\".Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed \"The Little Pearl Harbor\" after the Japanese air attack on the American naval base in Hawaii, was highly destructive in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, has proved far from easy.\nThe affair is the subject of two books: Disaster at Bari, by Glenn B. Infield, and Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup, by Gerald Reminick.\nIn 1988 through the efforts of Nick T. Spark, U.S. Senators Dennis DeConcini and Bill Bradley, Dr. Stewart Alexander received recognition from the Surgeon General of the United States Army for his actions during the Bari disaster.\n\n\n==== Charles Henderson explosion ====\nThe port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship Charles Henderson exploded in the harbour while offloading 2000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered nonoperational, this time for a month.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBari is the largest urban and metro area on the Adriatic.  It is located in Southern Italy, at a more northerly latitude than Naples, further south than Rome.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBari has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nShown above are the nine governmental community boards (Municipalities) of Bari: these are further divided into twenty neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\n\nTeatro Margherita.\nTeatro Piccinni.\nOrto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bari, a botanical garden.\nSanta Chiara, once church of the Teutonic Knights (as Santa maria degli Alemanni) and now houses a museum. It was restored in 1539.\nThe Acquedotto Pugliese\nThe medieval church of San Marco dei Veneziani, with a rose window in the fa\u00e7ade.\nConservatory of Bari\nSan Giorgio degli Armeni.\nSanta Teresa dei Maschi, the main Baroque church in the city (1690\u20131696).\nPane e Pomodoro Beach is the main beach within reach of the city. Its reputation has for several years suffered from the apparent presence of asbestos from nearby industrial plants.\nBari features two sea harbours: the Old Port and the New Port, constructed in 1850.\n\n\n==== Basilica of Saint Nicholas ====\n\nThe Basilica di San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from Myra in Lycia, and now lie beneath the altar in the crypt, where are buried the Topins, which are a legacy of old thieves converted to good faith. The church is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia (the others being the cathedrals of Acquaviva delle Fonti and Altamura, and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano).\n\n\n==== Bari Cathedral ====\nBari Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Sabinus of Canosa (San Sabino), was begun in Byzantine style in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170 and 1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the transept.\nAn example of Apulian Romanesque architecture, the church has a simple Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The crypt houses the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.\nThe interior and the fa\u00e7ade were redecorated in Baroque style during the 18th century, but these additions were removed in a 1950s restoration.\n\n\n==== Petruzzelli Theatre ====\nThe Petruzzelli Theatre, founded in 1903, hosted different forms of live entertainment, or nineteenth century \u201cPoliteama\u201d.  The theatre was all but destroyed in a fire on October 27, 1991. It was reopened in October 2009, after 18 years.\n\n\n==== Swabian Castle ====\n\nThe Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the Castello Svevo (Swabian Castle), was built by Roger II of Sicily around 1131. Destroyed in 1156, it was rebuilt by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.\n\n\n==== Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari ====\nThe Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari (Provincial Picture Gallery of Bari) is the most important art gallery in Apulia. It was first established in 1928 and contains many paintings from the 15th century up to the days of contemporary art.\n\n\n==== The Russian Church ====\nThe Russian Church of Saint Nicholas, in the Carrassi district of Bari, was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nicholas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.\nThe city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a trade-off with the Putin government in Moscow, exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a military barracks near Bari's central railway station.\n\n\n==== Barivecchia ====\nBarivecchia, or Old Bari, is a sprawl of streets and passageways making up the section of the city to the north of the modern Murat area. Barivecchia was until fairly recently considered a no-go area by many of Bari's residents due to the high levels of petty crime. A large-scale redevelopment plan began with a new sewerage system, followed by the development of the two main squares, Piazza Mercantile and Piazza Ferrarese.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 2015, there were 326,344 people residing in Bari (about 1.6 million live in the greater Bari area), located in the province of Bari, Puglia, of whom 47.9% were male and 52.1% were female. As of 2007, minors (children ages 18 and younger) totaled 17.90 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.08 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bari residents is 42 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bari grew by 2.69 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bari is 8.67 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.As of 2015, 3.8% of the population was foreign residents.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nAccording to an urban migration study in Bari, return migration gain to urban areas is higher than migration loss from urban areas. People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy.  Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes. Under 2% of migrants left Bari to go abroad and came to the city from abroad.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Fiera del Levante ===\nThe Fiera del Levante, held in September in the Fiera site on the west side of Bari city center, focuses on agriculture and industry,  There is also a \"Fair of Nations\" which displays handcrafted and locally produced goods from all over the world.\n\n\n=== Cuisine and gastronomy ===\n\nBari's cuisine is based on three typical agricultural products found within the surrounding region of Apulia, namely wheat, olive oil and wine. The local cuisine is also enriched by the wide variety of fruit and vegetables produced locally. Local flour is used in homemade bread and pasta production including, most notably, the famous orecchiette ear-shaped pasta, recchietelle or strascinate, chiancarelle (orecchiette of different sizes) and cavatelli.\nHomemade dough is also used for baked calzoni stuffed with onions, anchovies, capers and olives; fried panzerotti with mozzarella, simple focaccia alla barese with tomatoes, little savoury taralli, friselle and sgagliozze, fried slices of polenta, all make up the Bari culinary repertoire.\nVegetable minestrone, chick peas, broad beans, chicory, celery and fennel are also often served as first courses or side dishes.\nMeat dishes and the local Barese rag\u00f9 often include lamb and pork.\nPasta al forno, a baked pasta dish, is very popular in Bari and was historically a Sunday dish, or a dish used at the start of Lent when all the rich ingredients such as eggs and pork had to be used for religious reasons. The recipe commonly consists of penne or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with mozzarella or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.\nFresh fish and seafood are often eaten raw. Octopus, sea urchins and mussels feature heavily. Perhaps Bari's most famous dish is the oven-baked patate, riso e cozze (potatoes with rice and mussels).\nBari and the whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including Primitivo, Castel del Monte, and Muscat, notably Moscato di Trani.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe dialect of Bari belongs to the upper-southern Italo-Romance  family, and currently coexists with Italian; generally these are used in different contexts.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nLocal football club S.S.C. Bari, currently competing in Serie C (as of the 2019\u20132020 season), plays in the Stadio San Nicola, an architecturally innovative 58,000-seater stadium purpose-built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The stadium also hosted the 1991 European Cup Final.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBari has its own airport, Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, which is located 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of the centre of Bari. It is connected to the centre by train services from Bari Aeroporto railway station.\nBari Central Station lies on the Adriatic railway and has connection to cities such as Rome, Milan, Bologna, Turin and Venice. Another mainline is connection southwards by the Bari-Taranto railway. Regional services also operate to Foggia, Barletta, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto and other towns and villages in the Apulia region.\nBari has an old fishery port (Porto Vecchio) and a so-called new port in the north, as well as some marinas. The Port of Bari is an important cargo transport hub to S.E.Europe. Various passenger transport lines include some seasonal ferry lines to Albania, Montenegro or Dubrovnik. Bari-Igoumenitsa is a popular ferry line to Greece, some cruise ships anchor in Bari too.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bari, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 minutes. 11% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day.

        "wiki": "San Vito dei Normanni (Sanvitese: Santu Vitu) is an Italian town of 19,947 inhabitants of the province of Brindisi in Apulia.  The inhabitants are called Sanvitesi (or Santuvitisi in dialect) and the town is sometimes referred to as San Vito.\n\n\n== Physical geography ==\nThe town is located in the northeast of the Salento plains, not far from the Itria Valley.  The geomorphology of the land is flat, slightly undulating on the border with the municipalities of Carovigno and Ostuni. \nIt is located 9 kilometres (6 miles) from the Adriatic coast, the port nearest beach Specchiolla, a historic marine residence of San Vito.  San Vito also is 5 km (3 mi) from the Torre Guaceto, located in Serranova, a nature reserve, accessible by foot or bicycle (Pennagrossa Point), and 12 km (7 mi) from the tower which gives its name to the protected area.  The Ionian Sea is about 45 km (28 mi) away.  Its altitude is around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level precisely between 57\u2013146 m (187\u2013479 ft).  The highest point of the city center is located in Contrada Castello d'Alceste, 1,190 m (3,904 ft) asl.\n\n\n=== Territory ===\n\nThe nature of the San Vito soil is limestone. The landscape is characterized by cultivated fields with oak and olive trees and divided by stone walls used to separate farms. \nThe distances from major cities of Puglia are: \n\n21.6 km (13 mi) from Brindisi\n59.1 km (37 mi) from Lecce\n61.1 km (38 mi) from Taranto\n101.6 km (63 mi) from Bari\n152.7 kn from Trani\n160.8 km (100 mi) from Andria\n165.8 km (103 mi) from Barletta\n235.3 km (146 mi) from Foggia\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBased on averages of thirty years reference (1961\u20131990), the average temperature of the most cold month January, stands around 9.5 \u00b0C (49.1 \u00b0F), while that of hot month, August, is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Precipitation averages, less than 600 mm (23.6 in) per year.Climate classification of San Vito: \n\nClimate zone C;\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the city once included the words \"degli Schiavoni\", meaning \"of the Slavs\". To escape the persecutions of the Saracens, they migrated from Dalmatia to the opposite coast of the Adriatic, settling in late 963 in the fertile regions of Apulia. After that the town was called simply St Vitus, or St Vitus of the Slavs, or else San Vito in Terra d'Otranto. In 1863, after being returned to the Kingdom of Italy, which had been formed in 1861, the name of San Vito degli Schiavoni was changed and it assumed its current name of \"San Vito dei Normanni\" in honor of the man who is considered the founder of the medieval village, Bohemond of Hauteville (1050\u20131111), son of Robert Guiscard.\n\n\n== History ==\nArchaeological remains of a tomb in the Mondescine area contain the remains of thirty burials and various ceramics dating to 1800 BC - 1700 BC, show that the area was inhabited during the Bronze Age.  Also prehistoric settlements (18 - 9th century BC) have been found belonging to Messapi quarters in the Castle and Paretone area.\nThe village dates back to the Middle Ages (late 10th century), presumably by a colony of Slavs (emigrated from Slavonia) escaping the persecutions of the Saracens, and decided to settle in the fertile areas of San Vito founding \"Castro Sancti Viti\".Some scholars believe that the city was founded by the Norman Bohemond of Hauteville ( 1050 - 1111 AD), son of Robert Guiscard, who, to satisfy his love of hunting, ordered the construction of a square tower, which still exists today.The small village originally grew in the late Middle Ages when the Normans ensured security from the constant attacks of the Saracens.  This relative calm gave the opportunity to develop Sanvitesi trade, and to dominate the surrounding territory.  It was in the 15th century that the town was organized as a commune, though feudal servitude continued.  The commune belonged to the Altavilla, then to the Sambiase, then Raymond Orsini of the Balzo and then the Dentice Frasso.\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the city began to widen, extending north and east.  In 1484 it was sacked by the Venetians.  In 1571, during the Crusades, a handful of Sanvitesi took part in the Battle of Lepanto against the Ottoman Empire. In honor of the victory won, they built the Basilca Santa Maria della Vittoria and then dedicated it to the Madonna della Vittoria.  In 1799 it joined the Neapolitan Republic; the population during the 19th century the city was the seat of various participating circles to the Carbonari.During the Fascist period it experienced remarkable urban development. There were many important buildings built such as The Circle Elementary School, the seat of the Municipality, and the post office.  In 1927, the province of Brindisi was established which includes San VitoI. In 1943, it hosted King Victor Emmanuel III which was trying to escape to liberation, with Marshal Pietro Badoglio\u2019s government. In the early 1960s, the petrochemical industry in addition to engineering companies and Aeronavali of Brindisi San Vito have moved many workers from working the fields to the assembly line. \nThe opening of the San Vito dei Normanni Air Station into a strategic focal point during the Cold War, simultaneously created the work between the locals and received thousands of American workers. It closed after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Today San Vito is marketing to develop tourism.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious architecture ===\n\n\n==== Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria ====\nSanta Maria della Vittoria, simply called the \"Mother Church\", is the most important religious building in the city. The largest church in the city shows evidence of previous wars from the fist-sized holes that can be seen in and around the exterior. Built in the shape of a Latin cross with three naves, a transept and a deep chancel.  Inside valuable paintings such as the icon of Nicopeia, depicting the Virgin Mary, announcing to Pope Pius V the victory over the Turks, and a silver statue representing St. Vitus. \nOn the right side of the basilica there is the Holy Door, opened in October 1995 during celebrations for the fourth centenary of the church, beginning at the Holy Year Jubilee of the Church. Also the occasion was marked by the presentation of a new wooden altar, together all the furnishings of the sanctuary, of Flavio Pancheri. \nOn October 26, 1996, Pope John Paul II, during a special audience called on the Archdiocese of Brindisi-Ostuni, and solemnly crowned the icon of Our Lady Nicopeia.  The pope proclaimed the church a papal Basilica on December 30, 1998.\n\n\n==== Church of San Giovanni Evangelista ====\nSt. John the Evangelist is a church in Baroque style.  The fa\u00e7ade, with four pilasters with Corinthian capitals are in Lecce stone, which is very soft, allowing for striking decorations.  In the church there are six paintings, two of which placed in a wooden structure which includes frame and canopy, the other four are on the sidewalls.  The church,  was \"sold\" by the Dentice Frasso family of the symbolic sum of 10,000 lira to the City of San Vito.\n\n\n==== Chiesa Santa Maria degli Angeli ====\nThe \"Old Church\" was built around the 15th century.  Subsequent modifications took place in 1696 and 1763.  It has a simple fa\u00e7ade, marked by six pilasters with an elegant portal and an oval window with projecting cornices.  In its interior are side altars of stone, an altar in polychrome marble, a wood crucifix from the 16th century and an 1809 painting made by Domenico Carella.\n\n\n==== Church of Santa Maria della Mercede ====\n\"The church of St. Francis\" dates back to 1735 and was commissioned by Prince Fabio Marchese Belprato.  At the end of the 19th century, with the arrival of Mercedarian Order, there was installed a significantly larger cupola, sanctuary and adjoining convent.  The fa\u00e7ade has four pilasters with  Ionic capitals, two niches in which there are statues of Our Lady of Mercy and St. Francis of Paola.  Inside are chandeliers in wrought iron and the statue, in wood, of St. Francis.\n\n\n==== Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie ====\nThe \"Monastery\" is so named because until 1868, it was next to the convent of the Franciscan Friars Minor.  It was built in 1586, at the behest of Prince Palagano Lucius II, with a single aisle.  Then, with a subsequent action in 1700, it was added a second, and in 1898 a third.  The fa\u00e7ade is very simple, and has only two windows in the portal and central.  In the interior, there are nine altars in the side stones and paintings depicting the Crucifixion.  Moreover, in the aisles, there is the Piet\u00e0 by an unknown author, the Providence and San Salvador from Orte by local artist Giacomo da San Vito.\n\n\n==== Church of the Annunciation ====\nAlso called the Church of San Domenico, due to the presence of the nearby convent of the Dominicans until 1809.  The church was built around 1584 on land donated by a devotee.  It has a cusp fa\u00e7ade with two side pilasters, window and central portal by a local sculptor.  In 1984 the collapse of two aisles caused the closure for restoration work that lasted a decade.  Today, reconstructed, it has reopened for worship and there restored the six side stone altars of the 18th century and a tapestry from 1769 depicting the Annunciation by artist Domenico Carella.\n\n\n==== Church of San Michele Arcangelo ====\nBuilt in 1928 by Concetta Carlucci, who in a vision was invited to awaken the worship of the saint in the city.  The structure is very simple, has been enriched by a bronze portal surmounted by a lunette with a bas-relief depicting St. Michael the Archangel, by the sculptor Cosimo Giuliano Latiano and a statue depicting Concetta Carlucci.\n\n\n==== Other churches ====\nChurch of Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0, also called \"Church of the Hospital\"\nChurch of Santa Rita\nChurch of Santa Teresa\n\n\n==== Rock settlements ====\nThere are many rock art sites within San Vito made by Byzantine monks that fled from eastern Europe as they were persecuted because of their faith.  Such sites include: \nSan Biagio, which is located near the Jannuzzo farm, is a monastic Byzantine sanctuary placed in real rock.  The Orthodox rite is drawn inside a cave.  It also presents the cells intended for monks, but over time has undergone significant transformations.  Like all churches carved out along the last stretch of the Via Francigena, the sanctuary of San Biagio presents votive frescoes dedicated to Saint Blaise, St. Nicholas, St. Andrew, St. George, St. James and St. John.  The inscriptions on the iconography, are all in Greek except one, that of St. Nicholas, which sets in Latin as a sign of religious unity between the Orthodox Church and the Latin Church.\nSt. Nicholas in the San Nicola-Malpasso is located halfway between San Vito and Serranova.  The crypt and the four adjoining caves are located in a small valley, partly carved in rock, partly built in tuff.  Inside is the image of St. Nicholas and traces of frescoes can be seen in the walls of tufa.\nCrypt of San Giovanni is a settlement with several rock caves, some partially collapsed, in which two small cells were found with traces of graffiti.  Another, almost completely underground, is divided into seven side branches that converge into a central corridor.  The crypt presents a pillar around which rests three arcs.  Parts of frescoes, dating back presumably to the 13th century, are in the central apse.\nCrypt of St Mary the hamlet of St. James is situated in an old farmhouse, which was abandoned in the 15th century.  Inside the church has a fresco of the Virgin with Child.\n\n\n=== Civil architecture ===\n\n\n==== The Rezze ====\nRezza (from Retia in Latin, meaning network), is a type of shade used to protect houses' front doors mostly from direct sunlight but also from rain and wind.  Rezze are made by thin plates of wood placed horizontally and parallel to each other, with few millimeters between one another. These shades are usually either purple, green, yellow, brown or beige.  A traditional expression from San Vito is \"vecchia cretu la rezza\", literally meaning \"older woman behind the shade\" but indeed referring to someone who likes to spy on others without being seen.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\nIn the 1990s, just outside the town, specifically in Contrada Castello d'Alceste, traces of buildings dating back to Iron Age and, following excavations, a large Messapii settlement presumably dating from the period between the 7th and 4th centuries BC were found. That site could become the first Archeodromo of Italy. The archaeological site was the subject of several excavations made by the City Council of San Vito dei Normanni, the Archaeological Superintendence of Taranto and the University of Salento's Department of Cultural Heritage. \n\n\n=== Military architecture ===\n\n\n==== Castle of Dentice Frasso ====\nThe medieval  castle of Dentice Frasso, opposite the Town Hall with its ancient square tower, overlooks the main town\u2019s piazza. \nThe original access was via a drawbridge which was from the box located on the door of the Chapel The first building was undoubtedly the tower, believed to be Norman and dating from the 12th century.  Built by Bohemond of Hauteville in the 11th century, in a strategic position on the road that passed through the hamlet of San Vito and came to the old road for Oria.  It is perfectly intact, still dominates the area of San Vito.  The tower has Guelphs and Ghibellines-like battlements and narrow openings that allows indoor lighting. \nThere is a large courtyard that overlooks the cinquecento residence, characterized by a series of elegant rectangular boxes around the tower.  The castle was probably built originally as the residence of hunters, as once the territory of San Vito completely covered by forests.  The entrance to the building consists of a pointed arch, on top is placed a crest of the Dentice family.  The stairway leads to a stone porch column, on which rest three round arches. \nInside retains decorated suites, paintings, hunting trophies and the town archive.  The castle is privately owned and inhabited by descendants of the Dentice Frasso family.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\n\n==== Villa Comunale ====\nThe only green space of the city is the Villa Comunale, called the Pinewood due to the presence of large marine pines, and also many palm trees.  The park is at the center of the city and surrounds the primary school.\n\n\n==== Countryside ====\nA few kilometers from the city is Torre Guaceto (Guaceto Tower), a World Wildlife Fund nature reserve of the State whose extension is approximately 1,200 square feet (110 m2) and a sea front which stretches for about 8,000 mt.  The marine area is represented by a perfect rectangle, with an average depth of 3,000 meters, crossed and divided by State Road 379.  The reserve can be visited only on foot or by bicycle.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Demographic evolution ===\nThe demographic balance the municipality as of March 31, 2008 has 19,915 inhabitants, is as follows: 10,365 females and 9452 males.  7274 families the average family component is 2.7 (higher than the national average of 2.5, but less to the corresponding value of the region that instead of 2.8). \nThe town,  like many towns of Apulia experienced a slight decrease in population due to the decrease in part by birth rate which is matched by the fact that many young people decide to complete their university studies in a city in central-north especially Milan, Bologna and Rome.\n\n\n==== Migrations ====\nSan Vito was the subject of extensive emigration during the 20th century, first to the Americas, later towards northern Europe (especially Germany) and to northwestern Italy, but today the town has become a destination for immigrants from outside the European Union. \nA phenomenon that, at least for a decade now, seems to settle into the territory is that of immigration by families from northern Europe, especially English and Irish people.  These new arrivals usually consist of pensioners, not coming to work, who buy villas in the countryside of San Vito and enjoy the pleasant temperatures all year.  This phenomenon, relatively recent in Apulia, is known as \"Salentoshire\", a playful neologism along the lines of \"Chiantishire\", which refers to the consolidated British tourism in Tuscany.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe Sanvitese is a Brindisi dialect belonging to the southern extreme Salento family. Some Sanvitese idioms include: \n\nFigghiu mutu la mamma lu ntendi.  (The mother understands her mute child)\nCcugghimu li fierri..  (Take up the tools of the trade - taking what belongs to us and we go on)\nCi eti veru ca lu munnu gira, casa mea prima o ppoi av\u00e0 passai ti quai (if it is true that the world turns, my house sooner or later, must pass by here)\nCi unu nasci cu la capu tunna, no ppo mur\u00ec cu la capu quatrata (literally: if a person is born with a round head, it certainly will not die with a square head, figuratively speaking, if a person is made in a certain way, they will remain so until his death)\n\n\n=== The 'nciuria ===\nThe 'nciuria is the nickname that has a valence of mockery and is given to the inhabitants of any Salento town by the inhabitants of nearby towns.  The nickname of San Vito is \"mulacchiuni\" that is \"big mules\".  The reason for the 'nciuria is due to Sanvitesi attitude to differences, news and ideas.  They tend to remain stubborn on their ideas, even denying the evidence.  Like mules, the Sanvitese would have the blinders that are looking only forward, without further nuances or points of view.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\n\n==== Libraries ====\nJohn XXIII Biblioteca Comunale is the city\u2019s first public library, founded by Dominican friars.  They possessed thousands of leather-bound books and sorted into nine large closets.  Since 1809 the monks left the monastery and many works were lost.  In 1946, Mayor Vincenzo Trizza appointed a committee to create a new library.  They donated 750 volumes and ordered 450 books of classics, two encyclopedias, and books by fellow authors.  In 1962, the present library was founded through the efforts of Professor Angelo Pagliara, who sent letters to the highest offices of State and the Catholic Church to request materials. Pope John XXIII was the first to respond and gave three volumes of his speeches with handwritten signatures and, therefore, the library took name.\nSt. Benedict Public Library,  founded in 1940, is located in the convent of Benedictine Oblates of St. Scholastica but is open to the public.  It features about 26,000 volumes and pamphlets and specializes in Biblical, Theology, Patristics, and Ecumenism in the history of the Church.\n\n\n==== Schools ====\nThe city has four primary schools: Lanza del Vasto, Monsignor Francesco Passante, Don Lorenzo Milani, Viale Libert\u00e0; one first level secondary school, Meo-Buonsanto; and two second level secondary schools: Liceo Scientifico Leonardo Leo and Professional Institute for Social Services.\n\n\n==== Rural Museum ====\nThe Rural Museum implemented by local action group Altosalento, was inaugurated on July 21, 2001 and is currently managed by the Cultural Association AXAS Onlus.  The museum, like the town library, is located within the cloister of the Dominicans.  The museum houses a remarkable collection of objects and tools that bear witness to everyday rural life between the 18th century and the early 1950s.  The tools cover artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, saddlers, knife grinders, shoemakers and of course farmers.\n\n\n==== Castello d'Alceste Museum ====\nIn the Contrada Castello d'Alceste were found traces of a village huts in the second half of the 8th century BC.  It overlaps the 6th century BC buildings, reflecting the surge of new construction techniques and a new way to conceive of living space.  The houses of this period are divided into multiple environments and have complex roof systems that make use of tiles.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nWeb TV: Web TV Puntonet\nRadio: Teleradio San Vito.\nPress:\nIl Punto (eng: The Point): monthly\nL'Arcobaleno (eng: The Rainbow): bimonthly\nOcchio Magazine (eng: Eye Magazine) (monthly).\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\n\n==== Tarantism in San Vito ====\nTarantism (a type of Tarantella) blends pagan and Christian tradition. In the past it was believed,  that women who showed forms of hysteria, were infected by the bite of the tarantula.  The only known remedy was to dance continuously for days, so that the poison did not take effect. \nThrough music and dance to give healing to taranta (the tarantula bitten), creating a real exorcism of musical character.  Each time a tarantata exhibiting symptoms associated with Taranto, the drummers, fiddlers, mandolin, guitarists and accordionists went in the house of taranta and stakeholders to play the music from at a frantic pace.  Now the Tarantismo dance and sing for hours until they are exhausted.  The belief, that while their energies were consumed in the dance, even the tarantula is consumed and destroyed.  \nSan Vito retains a remarkable tradition of pinches that, unlike that of Lecce, appears free as a therapeutic repertoire and musical found only in this town.  In the 1950s at least thirty players could be involved in the care of the tarantati.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe sanvitese cucina is characterized by local traditional agricultural products. Local cuisine includes stuffed aubergines (maranciani chini), and traditional specialities made with mashed broad beans mixed with and vegetables (favi e fogghi). Other traditional dishes include \"frise\", round shaped hard bread soaked in water and topped with salt, with cherry tomatoes, olive oil and oregano and \"gnummarieddi\" or \"turcinieddi\", meat skewers made with lamb's innards. Sweets include the mustazzueli, chocolate dolcetti, sweet Cartedd\u00e0te, Christmas cakes in the shape of thin pastry rosettes fried in hot oil, the cupeta cake with almonds, and very soft pettole balls of dough fried in hot oil.  The municipality is a member of the olive oil coalition Collina di Brindisi and the wine coalition called Appia wines, which also includes the municipalities of Brindisi, Ostuni, Latiano and Mesagne.Almond milk is achieved by creating in an infusion of water with finely chopped almonds, and then squeezing them to bring out all the juice.  Puglia Region has entered the almond milk in the list of traditional Italian food products.  Limoncello  is a liquor made from the peel of fresh lemon and enriched with water, sugar and alcohol to be enjoyed both as an ap\u00e9ritif and as a digestive after meals.\n\n\n==== Wine ====\nThe territory of San Vito produces wines such as the Aleatico di Puglia Doc, Doc Ostuni, Puglia IGT.  Along the road of the municipality, there are indigenous varieties of grapes, the  Negroamaro, Primitivo, and Malvasia, which have been joined over the years by crops of white grape vines. \nMalvasia Nera di Brindisi is a grape of Greek origin and now widespread in most Mediterranean countries.  Its wine, called Malmsey in English, is sweet with a golden hue.  In Italy its cultivation has spread from Piedmont to Puglia.  Vinified properly, it can also make a dry white wine.  Sangiovese is a red grape variety, among the most widespread in Italy.  Negroamaro Novoli vine that also called \"tears\", has a special ability to produce rose to its chemical characteristics.  Ottavianello leaves are pentagonal green, smooth, opaque and the lower surface light green.\n\n\n== Notable Sanvitese ==\n\nGiacomo da San Vito (San Vito dei Normanni? - Naples, 1667): Friar,  Franciscan Order of Reformed Minor, was a prolific artist and his works can be seen in many towns of Puglia and Basilicata.\nLeonardo Leo (San Vito dei Normanni, August 5, 1694 - Naples, October 31, 1744): Baroque composer and founder of Neapolitan Musical School of the 18th century;\nVito Buonsanti (San Vito dei Normanni, June 22, 1762 - Naples, May 22, 1850): Supporters of the Republican movement, he became monk 's Dominican Order.

During the 1970s, San Vito experienced a second major urban development with the creation of the \u201czone 167\u201d north of the city.  This neighborhood is home to many condominiums, but also has residences and villas. Neighborhoods include Li stratoddi / Center, Chianti,  Gallo / Iaddu, San Franciscu / San Francis, Santa Rita, Area 167, and Zona PIP.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSan Vito dei Norman is primarily a center of agriculture and trade. The level of employment is above the provincial average.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAs for the primary sector, livestock is not well developed with herds of cattle and sheep.  Instead the agriculture industry relies on a thousand small and medium entrepreneurs engaged in intensive cultivation of fruits, vegetables, almonds and especially olives (Olea europea).\n\n\n=== Craft and industry ===\nIndustry in the territory is present with 250 industrial companies and 17.96% of the workforce.  The manufacturing sectors are agro-processing (like artichokes), but also mechanical, textile, packaging and wood processing companies.\n\n\n=== Services and Tourism ===\nThe activity of the service sector, is the fastest growing, with 17.22% of the employed labor force,  found primarily in services of transportation and storage businesses, as well as real estate agents. Employment is now reduced in public administration because of the closure of the U.S. military base in the past.  Lately, important experiments are being tried in tourism, allowing the industry to grow from year to year.\nUnfortunately the leak of education in the population and the bad organization of the city hall make the city,  especially the surrounding areas, a real open air dump with trashes of different types in the side streets and the fields. Even the roads have not maintains, making sure that many of these are unusable even by garbage collectors. \nIn addition, we often find corpses of animals on the side of the streets given by the large amount of annual abandonment of pets.\n\n\n== Infrastructure and Roads ==\nThe main road links are represented by \n\nA14 Bologna - Taranto: known as Bari-Lecce Highway.\nSS 16 connects San Vito dei Normans to Carovigno and Ostuni.\nBrindisi-Lecce expressway connects San Vito dei Normans through the SS 16.\nBrindisi-Taranto connects San Vito dei Normanni to Taranto through the provincial roads 48, 45 and 44.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nThe station in San Vito dei Normanni, served by the Adriatic railway, is currently active with passenger service, but it served by only a few regional trains.

The legend says that at the time of construction of the railroad, the prince did not want the \"new infernal machine\" to pass on its territories.  The local service stations is ensured by the ESF in Ceglie Messapica and Francavilla Fontana.\n\n\n== Twin Cities ==\n Salzwedel (Germany)\n Louviers (France)\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe San Vito Volley Volleyball team was founded in 1989 by the league President Luigi Sabatelli in the Series A of the Italian Women's volleyball championship.

        "wiki": "Matera (Italian pronunciation: [ma\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0ra], locally [ma\u02c8te\u02d0ra] (listen); Materano: Mat\u00e0r\u00eb [ma\u02c8t\u00e6\u02d0r\u0259]) is a city in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy.\nAs the capital of the province of Matera, its original settlement lies in two canyons carved by the Gravina River. This area, the Sassi di Matera, is a complex of cave dwellings carved into the ancient river canyon, often cited as \"one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.\" Over the course of its history, Matera has been occupied by Greeks, Romans, Longobards, Byzantines, Saracens, Swabians, Angevins, Aragonese, and Bourbons.By the late 1800s, Matera's cave dwellings became noted for intractable poverty, poor sanitation, meager working conditions, and rampant disease.  Evacuated in 1952, the population was relocated to modern housing, and the Sassi (Italian for \"stones\") lay abandoned until the 1980s.  Renewed vision and investment led to the cave dwellings becoming a noted historic tourism destination, with hotels, small museums and restaurants \u2014 and a vibrant arts community.\nKnown as la citt\u00e0 sotterranea (\"the underground city\"), the Sassi and the park of the Rupestrian Churches were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. In 2019, Matera was declared a European Capital of Culture.\n\n\n== History ==\nThough scholars continue to debate the date the dwellings were first occupied in Matera, and the continuity of their subsequent occupation, the area of what is now Matera is believed to have been settled since the Palaeolithic (10th millennium BC). This makes it potentially one of the oldest continually inhabited settlements in the world. Alternatively it has been suggested by architectural historian Anne Parmly Toxey that the area has been \"occupied continuously for at least three millennia and occupied sporadically for 150-700 millennia prior to this\".The town of Matera was founded by the Roman Lucius Caecilius Metellus in 251 BC who called it Matheola. In AD 664 Matera was conquered by the Lombards and became part of the Duchy of Benevento. Architectural historian Anne Parmly Toxey writes that \"The date of Matera's founding is debated; however, the revered work of the city\u2019s early chroniclers provides numerous, generally accepted accounts of Goth, Longobard, Byzantine, and Saracen sieges of the city beginning in the eighth century and accelerating through the ninth century CE.\" In the 7th and 8th centuries the nearby grottos were colonised by both Benedictine and Basilian monastic institutions. The 9th and 10th centuries were characterised by the struggle between the Byzantines and the German emperors, including Louis II, who partially destroyed the city. After the settlement of the Normans in Apulia, Matera was ruled by William Iron-Arm from 1043.\nAfter a short communal phase and a series of pestilences and earthquakes, the city became an Aragonese possession in the 15th century, and was given in fief to the barons of the Tramontano family. In 1514, however, the population rebelled against the oppression and killed Count Giovanni Carlo Tramontano. In the 17th century Matera was handed over to the Orsini and then became part of the Terra d'Otranto, in Apulia. Later it was capital of the province of Basilicata, a position it retained until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte assigned it to Potenza.\nIn 1927 it became capital of the new province of Matera.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== The Sassi (ancient town) ===\n\nMatera has gained international fame for its ancient town, the \"Sassi di Matera\". The Sassi originated in a prehistoric troglodyte settlement, and these dwellings are thought to be among the first ever human settlements in what is now Italy. The Sassi are habitations dug into the calcareous rock itself, which is characteristic of Basilicata and Apulia. Many of them are really little more than small caverns, and in some parts of the Sassi a street lies on top of another group of dwellings. The ancient town grew up on one slope of the rocky ravine created by a river that is now a small stream, and this ravine is known locally as \"la Gravina\". In the 1950s, as part of a policy to clear the extreme poverty of the Sassi, the government of Italy used force to relocate most of the population of the Sassi to new public housing in the developing modern city.\nUntil the late 1980s the Sassi was still considered an area of poverty, since its dwellings were, and in most cases still are, uninhabitable and dangerous. The present local administration, however, has become more tourism-orientated, and it has promoted the regeneration of the Sassi as a picturesque touristic attraction with the aid of the Italian government, UNESCO, and Hollywood. Today there are many thriving businesses, pubs and hotels there, and the city is amongst the fastest growing in southern Italy.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Monasteries and churches ===\n\nMatera preserves a large and diverse collection of buildings related to the Christian faith, including a large number of rupestrian churches carved from the calcarenite rock of the region. These churches, which are also found in the neighbouring region of Apulia, were listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.\nMatera Cathedral (1268\u20131270) has been dedicated to Santa Maria della Bruna since 1389. Built in an Apulian Romanesque architectural style, the church has a 52 m tall bell tower, and next to the main gate is a statue of the Maria della Bruna, backed by those of Saints Peter and Paul. The main feature of the fa\u00e7ade is the rose window, divided by sixteen small columns. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles. The decoration is mainly from the 18th century Baroque restoration, but recently a Byzantine-style 14th-century fresco portraying the Last Judgement has been discovered.\nTwo other important churches in Matera, both dedicated to the Apostle Peter, are San Pietro Caveoso (in the Sasso Caveoso) and San Pietro Barisano (in the Sasso Barisano). San Pietro Barisano was recently restored in a project by the World Monuments Fund, funded by American Express. The main altar and the interior frescoes were cleaned, and missing pieces of moldings, reliefs, and other adornments were reconstructed from photographic archives or surrounding fragments.There are many other churches and monasteries dating back throughout the history of the Christian church. Some are simple caves with a single altar and maybe a fresco, often located on the opposite side of the ravine. Some are complex cave networks with large underground chambers, thought to have been used for meditation by the rupestrian and cenobitic monks.\n\n\n=== Cisterns and water collection ===\n\nMatera was built above a deep ravine called Gravina of Matera that divides the territory into two areas. Matera was built such that it is hidden, but made it difficult to provide a water supply to its inhabitants. Early dwellers invested tremendous energy in building cisterns and systems of water channels.\nThe largest cistern has been found under Piazza Vittorio Veneto. With its solid pillars carved from the rock and a vault height of more than fifteen metres, it is a veritable water cathedral, which is navigable by boat. Like other cisterns in the town, it collected rainwater that was filtered and flowed in a controlled way to the Sassi.\nThere were also a large number of little superficial canals (rasole) that fed pools and hanging gardens. Moreover, many bell-shaped cisterns in dug houses were filled up by seepage. Later, when the population increased, many of these cisterns were turned into houses and other kinds of water-harvesting systems were realised.\nSome of these more recent facilities have the shape of houses submerged in the earth.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe Tramontano Castle, begun in the early 16th century by Gian Carlo Tramontano, Count of Matera, is probably the only other structure that is above ground of any great significance outside the sassi. However, the construction remained unfinished after his assassination in the popular riot of 29 December 1514. It has three large towers, while twelve were probably included in the original design. During some restoration work in the main square of the town, workers came across what were believed to be the main footings of another castle tower. However, on further excavation large Roman cisterns were unearthed. Whole house structures were discovered where one can see how the people of that era lived.\nThe Palazzo dell'Annunziata is a historical building on the main square, seat of Provincial Library.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOn 17 October 2014, Matera was declared European Capital of Culture for 2019, together with Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe crapiata is an old recipe hailing from Matera dating to the Roman period. It is a common ritual grown into \"Sassi di Matera\" and celebrated on 1 August; it is still celebrated.\nThe crapiata is a simple dish of water, chickpeas, beans, wheat, lentils, potatoes and salt.\nMatera's bread is a local bread made with durum wheat, dating to the Kingdom of Naples, and typically featuring three incisions, symbolizing the Holy Trinity.\nMatera's inhabitants, as the tradition says, during the Carnival were used to eat the meat of the sheep that could not longer be used to produce milk or wool. The owner of the sheep, already dead, put it on a table and took away its coat. Later the meat was cut and so ready to be cooked. Because the sheep weighed about 8\u201310 kg., when they cooked it they invited all the neighbours and they enjoyed dance, music and wine. The meal was called pignata (in dialect:\"La pign\u00e8t\") after its terracotta pot shaped like an amphora. In the pot with the sheep meat there were other food like shelled and cut potatoes(\"U pat\u00e8n sczzl\u00e8t i tagghi\u00e8t\"), cut or even whole onion (\"La cjpaud\"), tomatoes in pieces (\"\u2018U pmmdaur\"), celery (\"L\u2019occij\") and salt (\"\u2018U s\u00e8l\"). The container was closed with a wheat dough before being placed on low fire powered with the charcoal. The cooking lasted about 3\u20134 hours and then the meat could be eaten with cheese.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\nBecause of the ancient primeval-looking scenery in and around the Sassi, it has been used by filmmakers as the setting for ancient Jerusalem. The following famous biblical period motion pictures were filmed in Matera: \n\nPier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964)\nBruce Beresford's King David (1985)\nMel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ (2004)\nAbel Ferrara's Mary (2005)\nCatherine Hardwicke's The Nativity Story (2006)\nCyrus Nowrasteh's The Young Messiah (2016)\nTimur Bekmambetov's Ben-Hur (2016)\nGarth Davis's Mary Magdalene (2018)Other movies filmed in the city include:\n\nMario Volpe's Le due sorelle (1950)\nAlberto Lattuada's La lupa (1953)\nRoberto Rossellini's Garibaldi (1961)\nLuigi Zampa's Roaring Years (1962)\nBrunello Rondi's Il demonio (1963)\nNanni Loy's Made in Italy (1965)\nFrancesco Rosi's More Than a Miracle (1967)\nLucio Fulci's Don't Torture a Duckling (1972)\nRoberto Rossellini's Anno uno (1974)\nPaolo and Vittorio Taviani's Allonsanf\u00e0n (1974)\nFernando Arrabal's The Tree of Guernica (1975)\nCarlo Di Palma's Qui comincia l'avventura (1975)\nFrancesco Rosi's Christ Stopped at Eboli (1979)\nFrancesco Rosi's Three Brothers (1981)\nPaolo and Vittorio Taviani's The Sun Also Shines at Night (1990)\nGiuseppe Tornatore's The Star Maker (1995)\nJohn Moore's The Omen (2006)\nLiu Jiang's Let's Get Married (2015)\nMatteo Rovere's Italian Race (2016)\nPatty Jenkins's Wonder Woman (2017)\nCary Joji Fukunaga's No Time to Die (2020)\n\n\n=== Music ===\nMatera appears in the music videos for the songs \"Sun Goes Down\" (2014) by Robin Schulz and \"Spit Out the Bone\" (2016) by Metallica.\n\n\n=== Religious traditions ===\n\nThe origins of the festival are not well known, because its story has changed while being handed down from generation to generation. One of these legends says that a women asked a farmer to go up on his wagon to accompany her to Matera. When she arrived to the periphery of the city, she got off the wagon and asked farmer to bring an her message to bishop. In this message she said she was Christ's mother. The bishop, the clergy and the folk rusched to receive the Virgin, but they found a statue. So the statue of Madonna entered in the city on a triumphal wagon. Another legend talks about a destruction of the wagon: Saracens besiege Matera and the citizens to protect the painting of Madonna, hit it on a little wagon. then they destroyed the wagon to not let the Saracens take the painting.Different hypotheses are attributed to the name of Madonna della Bruna : the first one says that the noun derives from the Lombard high-medieval term br\u00f9nja (armor/protection of knights). So the name mean Madonna of defense. Another hypothese supports that the name comes from herbon, a city of Guinea, where the Virgin went to visit her cousin Elisabetta. The last hypotese says that the name comes from the colour of the Virgin's face. The profane insertions as the navalis wagon and its violent destruction, with the intimacy and the religious solemnity, make this festival an interesting event that sinks its roots in the ancient representations that happened in a lot of mediterranean's countries. For example, in Greek culture celebrating  also wedding parties through tiumphal wagon (ships on wheels richly designed) was recurring.  \nThe Madonna's sculpture is located into a case in the trasept of the cathedral, dedicated to her. Here there is also a fresco that portrays her. It dates back to the 13th century and it belongs to the Byzantine school.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nLuigi De Canio (1957), football manager\nEgidio Romualdo Duni (1708\u20131775), composer\nEmanuele Gaudiano (1986), show jumping rider\nCosimo Fusco (1962), actor\nJohn of Matera (1070\u20131139), Benedictine monk and saint\nEnzo Masiello (1969), Paralympic athlete\nAntonio Persio (1542\u20131612), philosopher\nTommaso Stigliani (1573\u20131651), poet and writer\nGiovanni Carlo Tramontano (1451\u20131514), nobleman\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nMatera is the terminal station of the Bari-Matera, a narrow gauge railroad managed by Ferrovie Appulo Lucane.

          "My DNA history dates back to the ancient days of this magnificent city. I have been fortunate enough to visit almost every summer but it never fails to amaze me every single time I see it. The photos do absolutely no justice at all. Matera was once one of the poorest places in",
          "I have wanted to visit Matera for many years, and wasn't disappointed with the visit. It is no longer a slum, and many places are being repaired and made habitable again, I gather it is now a very desirable place to live! Many of the houses are built into the rock, as cave",
          "Matera is a truly amazing place, and an unmissable item on any visit to Puglia. We took the guided tour, and although I usually hate being herded around in a group, it`s a must if you want to understand the history of the town and get all the relevant information. There is so",
          "The nice thing about Matera is gettng lost in the most beautiful town of Apulia. The town is so unique that you can\u2019t compare it with anything you have ever seen. Don\u2019t forget the church in the rock. Do not only follow the 3 tour loops, take the sometomes steep steps down into",
          "All I can say is to visit Matera a second time as it is so overwhelming you aren\u2019t able to absorb it all. Just walking through 9000 years of history as such is already breathtaking...",
          "Words can't describe sassI in Matera, it's just so unique with houses and alleyways. A different world from a different time. Fantastic",
          "I loved our 5 day stay. The place is magical in all aspects. I love the way it's being restored. Facsinated by the merging of modern designs with history. Great food at reasonable prices. However, being declared a world heritage, perhaps it should be more reachable for more",
          "We were lucky enough to spend three full days in Matera, while many visitors see this place in a much shorter timeframe. Really worth spending at least one night in situ, you will not regret it !",
          "Matera is quickly turning into a high end tourist location. On one hand, this is a good thing, but is ironic when you know a little about it\u2019s history. Matera owes a lot of it\u2019s discovery to one book. Carlo Levi\u2019s \u201cChrist Stopped at Eboli\u201d, meaning Southern Italy was too poor",
          "Wander around in the beautiful maze of little streets. This city keeps surprising you. Around every corner, there is a different view. We\u2019ve spent several days here and every day, we discovered something new. There are some beautiful restaurants, gelateria\u2019s and nice souvenir",

          "This a place that I though only existed in books. Pictures don't really do it justice to be honest. We did a tour with Amy (materatours.net) which was great to learn the history and walk around the main sights, but just go out and walk on your own, get lost and see where you end",
          "We were here only 2 days/1 night but our hotel was awesome and we took a tour of the town and it is a must on your next trip to this area. We have to go back again. They are doing a revitalization of this town for 2019 and they are all getting involved. So wonderful!!!",
          "Walking in a true historic environment. Beautifull, ancient city. Because cars can\u2019t drive in most of the streets, you really feel the history.",
          "Impressively incredible cave and other dwellings looking like they are from a past period, two millennia ago. There are fascinating cave churches, cobblestone streets, lots of ancient history, unique atmosphere, and more.",
          "A lot of walking to do and need to have the appropriate shoes because of the cubic stone ground that covers the entire city and at points is also slippery, so be careful! Loved the narrow passages and staircases that are at every corner! Beautiful place that was definitely worth",

          "We arrive in a very rainy and grey day so we had to leave and return in the late afternoon early eve. This town is so pretty to travel in - a MUST visit if you are in the area (even a journey from Puglia is worthwhile!)",
          "An Italian friend took us there. Even though its European cultural city 2019, I\u2019ve never heard of it. First look it seems like many ancient city built on a hill, like many I\u2019ve seen in Sicily. But after the first place I visited the ancient aqua vault, I soon learnt it was",
          "One can only understand only if one is in the middle of it all. Very impressive and definitely nothing compares on earth with this part of Italy. Amazing how the population survived and what a great job has been done of the same Sassi to meet the demands of the 21st Century",
          "It is hard to describe just how extraodinary this hidden cave city is, and to consider that thousands still lived there into the 1950s until they were forced to leave. Many have been restored as restaurants and places to stay (ironically for the affluent tourists) but there",

          "In contrast to a modern housing zone, Matera is bound to look primeval. Yet the clustered dwellings, some actually hewn into the rocky hillside, are not untypical of the old communities of the region. The random arrangement of homes, a labyrinth of burrows and warrens, which",
          "Excellent place to get lost. It's easy to get lost but also a great expirience. A lot of beautiful hidden houses, streets and views.",
          "A guided tour is a must. The fact that most of the buildings are actually caves is interesting, but the city would be worth a visit even if they weren't. The narrow winding streets, close quarters, white stone, and fascinating architecture would be worth the trip by",
          "Sassi di Matera is a must to be visited. It's unbelievably beautiful with breathtaking views. To think the caves were once lived in by the villagers. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, hotels and bed & breakfast places around Matera, definitely spoilt for choice.",
          "Today my family was taken on a walking tour of the Sassi with a very knowledgeable local guide Antonio. We had walked around ourselves yesterday but it was much better to have him explain what we were looking at. The story, and history, of this place is something I will never",
          "What an amazing city with a fascinating history. Unlike all the grandeur of Rome, Florence and the other highlights in Italy, this is an insight into the living conditions and circumstances that ordinary folk experienced daily for thousands of years. Wonderful city to walk",

          "Such a cool place to take a stroll. As you enter you get stunning vistas of the Italian countryside. You then descend into the ancient city and admire the way the homes are built into the rock on top of one another. I did this on a cruise port excursion and loved the day.",
          "Matera is located on the arch of Italy's boot. A life-long Matera resident and tour guide met us for a walking tour of Old Town Matera and the Sassi, prehistoric cave dwellings that are being updated and converted into a thriving community. About 1800 people now live in Old",

          "Matera will be European cultural capital in 2019. That is well deserved. The small city is simply stunning. History is all around you. We walked through the two Sassi\u2019s in two days and kept being surprised. The visit to three grotto churches is certainly worthwhile as they are",
          "We liked this place very much. Unfortunately we came there in the second half of the day and have not enough time to see everything. This place is a mix of old and modern city, hiking tours and cultural immersion. I would recommend to stay here overnight.",
          "We had a private guide through Tours by Locals and couldn't have had a better visit. First view of ravine upon arrival is a jaw-dropping sight. Learn about the history of the local people before arrival to better understand and appreciate area. Visit the caves and take a walk",
          "Parco della Murgia Materana is located 7km from Matera and you can get there by driving yourself if you have a car, crossing via the swing bridge when it is open, or taking a tour. Unfortunately unless you have a private guide, the only tour offered is an Italian tour",
          "Caves that were occupied for centuries and by the 1950s were known as \"the shame of Italy\" have been repurposed as hotels, B&Bs, and residences. Impossible not to look at the landscape and not think of what Jerusalem must have looked like 2000 years ago.",
          "The old center of Matera is a very popular tourist destination. I think it is well worth a visit. It gives you insight into how people used to live in their cave dwellings. Some of those can be visited, but you have to get a separate ticket for each and every one of them. You",
          "Visited Matera as part of our Apulia trip this November. Didn\u2019t have high expectations but decided to go for few hours. We were all stunned by the vow to the old stone city. The view from the terrace is just fabulous. I can hardly find the right words to describe it. You must",

          "Highly recommended. A great place to explore with incredible history, architecture. Sassi and it\u2019s three districts are each distinct with their own character and no surprise it is an UNESCO world heritage site and will be the 2019 city of culture. Older even than Damascus!",
          "If you are anywhere near Matera than you have to visit the Sassi Di Matera. One of the most unique historical places in the world, in which the same ancestral inhabitants occupied the same cave houses for 9000 years. An incredible history with beautiful architecture. Many movies",

          "Great experience to see habital caves . This was our second time and it was just as enjoyable. Parking was very difficult.",
          "We spent a very interesting day here, it is worth taking a guided walking tour as there is a lot one would miss without the information from the guide.. We traveled from near Fasano in Puglia which took about 1 hour 30 minutes but it was well worth the time.",
          "We drove here from Martina Franca, a 1/1/2 hour drive but well worth it. Parking can be a problem but the is a good car prk in Pasquale Vena and is only a short walk to the Sassi area. As one of the oldest cities in the world that was continually inhabited, Sassi of Matera",

          "We did not quite know what to expect from Matera but it really is a beautiful place well worth the journey there - and the many steps one has to climb when exploring it. The Sassi itself is small and easily seen in a day, perhaps with the second half of the day spent exploring",
          "As an architect I had high expectations of Matera and I was definitely not disappointed This needs to be on everyone\u2019s bucket list, it is authentic and unlike many other historic sites it has not been over commercialised or become a glorified flee market but remains a piece of",
          "Matera is a city built on the rocks, cultural capital in 2019 and World Heritage. But this is not everything; this is a must see place, with amazing views and beautiful houses built directly on the rocks, full with caves, placed on the top of the mountain. It was an",
          "Wow, we did not know what to expect and were blown away by the sheer beauty of this city built in the caves, we had 4 days, were there for the yearly festival and didn\u2019t want to leave. The people of Matera were very proud of their home and so they should be, I just hope the",
          "Amazing history over thousands of years with several twists and turns since the 1950s. Visit the exhibition including the amazing snow storage (Neveria).",
          "A must see place. One of the most interesting towns in Southern Italy. Full of sights, flavours and experiences.",
          "Definitely this is one the most amazing place I have visited. The European capital of cultural 2019 has much more to offer. Incredible...",
          "This place is amazing. It takes your breath away. This is a must see not just because it is part of the unesco heritage but because it is a unique place. I have never seen something like that.",
          "Matera is an amazing city and unlike any town I have seen before - a guided tour of the Sassi is highly recommended as the history, including how it was almost demolished, is fascinating. The chiese rupestre (rock churches) are fascinating. Get there before 2019 if you can, as",
          "What a fascinating place to visit. It\u2019s beautiful in the Sassi, but also tragic to think people were still living in caves in the 1960s. There are a few preserved as they were with artefacts inside, including a rock church. Only 3 Euro each to see, so a must. Parking can be a",
          "An amazing piece of history. The moment you cross over the hill into the sassi you feel like you you are transported back in time. It\u2019s absolutely Breath taking. You must see the cave churches and do yourself a favour visit casa Noha. The only negative is all the work taking",
          "Until the 1960s many people in Matera lived in caves with no electricity, no running water and no indoor plumbing. The government forced them to move to new homes, Take a walking tour with a guide. We were lucky to have a girl whose father grew up in this complex and so she knew",
          "can't say anymore, one of the best places we have visited in Italy amazing, not crowded like so many great places",
          "Matera is an unique experience, an ancient town, charming, and delightful. We included it during a trip to the Amalfi Coast and so glad we did. Spent 2 days walking the narrow streets and exploring the caves.",
          "There are a lot of construction sites in Sassi as they are preparing Matera for Culture city in 2019. We didn't have much time so we decided to hire an \u201dape\u201d (named after Piagio model Ape calessino, not a monkey) car and a driver/guide for a quick tour. This was a good idea:",
          "The Sassi were a disgrace to Italy as declared by the then President in the 1950s. People were living in caves which were overcrowded and living conditions were squalid. There was a high infant mortality rate and malaria was rife. As a consequence people were forcibly removed",
          "We toured two days in the marvelous, amazing, unique Sassi di Matera. The walking tour with Anna Maria Tamburrino as a guide plus the maps and highlights of places for us to see on our own was exceptional. Anna was so full of interesting historical details and personal stories",
          "A day trip from Bari is easy by train and that was enough for us. A wonderful town overlooking a gorge which is riddled with grottos some of which were once homes. The old town too has caves and churches hewn into the Rock that are worth a look even if you feel you have seen",
          "To think it was inhabited by troglodytes all the way to today is fascinating. Though in 1952 most of the houses were evacuated, due to the primitive conditions, some are being reconditioning, with of course facilities, electricity, running water. Reminds me of Capadoccia.",
          "This really is a must visit and you must also make sure you see all of it. It is very easy to miss the cave dwellings. Unfortunately it is also being done up at a very quick rate and will lose a lot of its charm.",
          "In order to comprehend how beautifull this town really is you need to take a long walks on its streets. At each corner you may encounter another beautifull scenery, just point your camera and shoot, this is why is no longer a mistery why so many famous movies were filmed here.",
          "This area was considered the \"shame of Italy\" people were living here in caves with their livestock until the 1950s when the government evacuated everyone. It is only in the last 20 years that people have started moving back and opening hotels and restaurants. Many of the caves",
          "Not to be missed if you are travelling in southern Italy. Ancient town built in stone. Caves where families lived in. Amazing atmosphere buth during the day and night. Stay in a hotel offering grotto accomodations.",
          "I absoluetly enjoyed the sassi . It is an amazing trip through the past with its small coffee shops and restaurants is for enjoying the atmesphere and soak in the past. It is a must see",
          "Interesting area with lots of great restaurants and a buzzing street at night. If you there make sure you go see the cave dwellings across the ravine. Also in the area is the Tulli Huts.",
          "Sassi di Matera has to be seen to be believed. Simply stunning and worth exploring. The experience differs between day and night and worthwhile doing both. As the sun begins to set the Sassi di Matera takes on a magical aura. Suggest wearing sensible walking shoes as the",
          "We spent an afternoon walking through the ancient town of Matera. What an amazing experience! There is a bit of walking and many stairs to climb so be prepared with comfortable shoes and clothing but I can assure you that it is well worth it. A must see on any holiday to",
          "Absolutely amazing and totally worth coming to visit. Definitely unique in the world, it feels like going back to Jerusalem 2000 years ago. Fascinating place rich of culture and history where is fantastic to get lost in.",
          "The Sassi area in Matera is downhill from the more modern, affluent area. The roads are uneven and slippery so take care. Not too many gift shops but a cave church, museum depicting a sassi house and lots of interesting sassi building. The gift shop has books about the history.",
          "This two-and-a-half hour tour is the perfect way to start your visit to Matera. Anna is very informed and cultured (she has a bachelor\u2019s in Italian literature) and her English is impeccable. On the tour, she takes you through the Sasso Caveoso, stopping to tour a furnished",
          "Two weeks in Italy and we saw a lot of beautiful places, but this was our favourite. My only regret: not staying longer. What a beautiful, amazing place.",
          "I don\u2019t think anything can prepare you for the feeling of Matera...if you can make this a place to stay overnight you won\u2019t regret it. A quick 3hr stop over just wouldn\u2019t do it justice! We had two nights which meant we could do a sunset walking tour as well as an early morning",
          "Matera is well worth a visit it is simply jaw dropping. Allow at least two days and get over to the other side for the view back if u can. Wonderful!",
          "It is hard to believe that people lived in the Sassi as recently as the 1950s. Then called 'The Shame Of Italy' you can now visit the caves which have been furnished in the way they were before the inhabitants left. An amazing museum with a very informative film first, the",
          "Matera is a wondrous town. toll on at the caves that people inhabited is something to see, also the fact that it's possibly the 3rd oldest continually inhabited city in the world is just another reason to go. The food at the hotbar in the small supermarket was outstanding and",
          "This should not be missed if you are visiting Puglia. Be sure to take a tour of one of the caves that was inhabited as recently as the 1950s.",
          "The most amazing and impressive place visited in this area! UNESCO site + city of cultur in 2019. A -M A Z I N G! Buildings, people, places, restaurants, overall area, surroundings ... please allow yourself at least one day to stroll around and you will not regret!",
          "The Southern part of Italy has a lot of places to discover and I must admit Matera is one of these! I walked around the Sassi and enjoy them a lot. Local people are very friendly. I do love it.",
          "So much history. From cave men through to today. It\u2019s like a Disney set but it\u2019s real. Culture capital of Europe is well placed here.",
          "I did not realize, after researching a lot, that there is a thriving / busy city leading right up the the ancient town of Matera. Driving wasn't at the crazy Naples / Palermo level, but it was close! I'll post a picture of where to drive / park as you walk in to stay at the",
          "We spent two nights here on a tour of Southern Italy. I\u2019d seen Matera on an Italian cookery programme and always wanted to visit. It didn\u2019t disappoint and in fact the sassi area was bigger than I\u2019d expected - the old historic areas are often quite small in reality and surrounded",
          "From the approach to the Sassi this place is true transportation to the past. A perfect place to get lost in the many streets and paths that wrap around this town. A hidden gem which will truly be hit by the height of tourism in years to come.",
          "Too many accolades for this place - unique, history in front of you, photographers dream, left a last impression, emotional walking around Sassi and thinking of life back then, touristy but must see, you won\u2019t regret it, best to go outside peak times. Wear comfy with grip flat",
          "This is a wonderful italian city that have a lot to offer. Get lost in the stone streets and wonderful rooftops. Have a hike on the other side of town to get the best view. The city is really unique and a must see if you are wandering around south Italy. Don't forget to stop for",
          "What a stunning place to visit. But beware, good shoes with a decent grip are a must as there are many \"ups\" and \"downs\" over slippery marble steps and gradients. Hard to believe that until the 50's people actually lived in these caves (they were apparently Italy's worst",
          "The \"Sassi\" district is rich in history and spectacular to view. There are so many walking trails to follow, some which can be a little bumpy so good shoes are recommended. Lots of steps, stairs and steep roads as the district is built into the hillside. Elderly and disabled",
          "A truly stunning place to visit and magical place to stay. As a historical location Matera has so much to offer with caves dating back to Palaeolithic times and adorned with Byzantine murals in one side of the valley and the stunning Baroque churches and cave systems with dark",
          "Take 2 days to discover this gem! As well during daytime as late in the evening. Or book a guided tour (not between 12-15 hrs. Its too hot) There are many interesting details to know.",
          "We stayed here for 3 x nights and really enjoyed exploring the old city. It is quite large, so you will need some sensible walking shoes. There are plenty of bars and restaurants to visit, so take the time to have a full wander around and see the sights - the churches, the",
          "Lots of walking. Matera is built into the side of the hills, so you need to be pretty fit to walk around and see everything. Beautiful drive up to Matera. Found a great restaurant in Matera, Kapunto. Read my review on this very special restaurant.",
          "Amazing!! An incredible historical site. Make sure you bring good walking shoes. Be sure to visit both sides of the canyon.",
          "Nice place to visit but very hot. Lots of places to wander, eat and drink and explore the history. Enjoy.",
          "We decided to stop off at matera on our drive from Malta to uk. We had booked 4 nights in a cave. Matera is magical there is so much to see and do. All the museums and caves have been renovating to a very high standard. We will be back on our return trip to Malta.",
          "Matera is nice to discover on your own. I suggest a one day trip. Tourist Info is a rip off, since they tell you that you have to pay upon entering some buildings, which is not the case, and if you take the tour it will become cheaper. Only in one 'household' there was a \u20ac2",
          "It\u2019s no wonder this has been designated at UNESCO World Heritage Site; the Sassi are incredible! The site is ancient, and much of both Sassi\u2014Barisano and especially Caveoso\u2014are still abandoned. But wander down into the labyrinthine streets and you\u2019ll find a remarkably vibrant",
          "Astonishing! So old but it is being gentrified . Go soon if you want to see it before it becomes a glossy tourist destination.",
          "We were fortunate to go before the crowds of summer and with fabulous weather which then changed to moody grey. These dwellings are amazing, the town is full of surprises. I would definitely get this on my list, in fact it should be on the bucket list!!!",
          "Lots of history, lots of walking, lots of fun. Be prepared to climb a lot of steps, but the scenery is amazing. Be sure to get a tour to the other side of the canyon.",
          "At each turn a different view, totally amazing. We did our own tour, which we have done over the three days we have been here. There are a lot of tour groups and it\u2019s nice to be able to stop for a while for coffee, enter the churches etc at your leisure. It is pretty warm, the",
          "This place has to be seen to be believed. Completely unique and beautiful I cannot really describe it. During the day it is breathtaking but at night it is lit up and looks magical. Wear comfy shoes as you will be walking for miles around the city and prepare to climb",
          "Stepping back in time to see dwellings, originally built in caves, one above the other. Most now have facades added. Best to do with local guide to hear history.",
          "I confess that six months ago, I knew nothing of the Matera Sassi. I was looking for unique places to visit, and certainly found it here! We stayed in Matera (Corte San Petro, highly recommended) and enjoyed two days and an evening there. The atmosphere is like nothing",
          "Sassi di Matera is like from other dimension! Where ever you go, you will have something to see. If you get lost, you will see all the best places. You are bound to be speechless, amazed and you will never forget that trip. Highly recommended!",
          "Well worth a visit but make sure you can go up and down stairs as nothing is flat there. Probably one of the nicest town to visit in Puglia as you can just wander in the streets and get lost.",
          "Beautiful place to visit , views are breathtaking ! Incredible trip, amazing stay in cave hotel \ud83d\ude0d part of unesco heritage",
          "The Sassi are great, unique and charming. A lot of walking is needed, and you often find yourself with no-one else around. A highly recommended day out .",
          "It\u2019s hard to explain the feeling you get when visiting the Sassi since a sense of history emanates from them. Early Christians took refuge from persecution in these limestone and tufa caves. We were lucky enough to snag an apartment that was a former cave dwelling and visit",
          "An absolute MUST. It is almost hard to believe how so many lived there for so long. What made me laugh is that when travelling I am usually fine with maps and directions. This was a maze and had me scratching my head a few times.But what a great maze to be wandering in!! A must",
          "All I can say is try to get there before the rest of the world discovers Matera. I am still awestruck by the views of the Sassi. I recommend that you enhance your visit to Matera by staying in one of the hotels in the Sassi. Photos of the Sassi do not do it justice. This is",
          "We drove from Positano, down to Amalfi and Paestum, then across to Matera. The drive there is through hills and mountains so very scenic. A fair amount of it is on the freeway so it's fast and smooth. The Sassi part of Matera is really something. It's like jumping in a time",
          "Do learn about the area and it ancient history. Walk the town and area. Look for the hidden gems. Something you must experience.",
          "The Sassi are slum dwellings that were cleared of inhabitants about 40-50 years ago. Now, as they are being gentrified, a tourism industry has \"sprung\" up. Not much to see and not much to do.",
          "While in Matera we stopped in a local tourist office (not an official TI)and booked a tour of the Sassi. Our guide was very personable and knowledgable, she gave us an excellent 2 1/2 hour tour of the Sassi and was very patient answering our questions. We enjoyed Matera very",
          "I spent a weekend in Matera, to celebrate my friend's wedding. As usual, we took our chance to explore the Sassi again. Amazing, every time it seems the first time. Shocking views especially at night. Definitely worth another trip!",
          "Can\u2019t be missed. Lots of renovations going on for 2019. Views up to the town and across the gorge are fab.",
          "When I chose Matera on our trip around Southern Italy I did read the short blurb about the history etc and thought it worth a visit. Little did I know just how enjoyable it would be. There is so much history here, and a very pleasant two day visit gives a good chance to look",
          "Amazing city, this old part of the city is wonderful, also at night time. We spent a night here, we were located near the old City and the views are great. I really recommend this tour!",
          "We enjoyed both a light lunch and a full dinner at the Trattoria Caveoso during our3 day stay in Matera. Both were excellent.",
          "Don't miss this place. It is an amazing sight to behold. A life changing visit, with a wonderful history. I recommend a guided tour as there is so much that you can miss.",
          "Great destination beyond our expectations. People are gracious and helpful. History, cultural development, Architecture and environmental integration require some homework before arriving in order to full appreciate what has and going on here.",
          "What a beautiful old town littered with alleys and churches both above and below ground. Many rupestrian churches with well preserved frescoes. This town needs exploring by foot. Be prepared to climb many steps and wander many alleys and be temporarily lost to then find your way",
          "Here as part of a VBT pre-trip tour. Was an amazing 2 days in the Sassi! Lots of walking. Great views from everywhere.",
          "We are on a trip in the south of Italy. So far it is the most magical and incredible place we found. If you want to find something mystic, go to Matera",
          "We travelled around Puglia and before we left we wanted to see this place after hearing some of its stories and especially as it will become a Capital of Culture in 2019. I am still blown away by this subterranean City and that it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited",
          "Never even knew this place existed until a friend invited us to go visit. When we arrived we went on a guided tour that we found after doing some checking around. Price was 20 euros each. Well worth it to make efficient use of our time and gain access to places we would never",
          "We loved the Sassi, each one quite different, and it was odd to be walking on a footpath between chimneys of the houses below. Wear suitable footwear - narrow paths, steep and uneven steps - and follow where the footpaths lead you!",
          "A beautiful town on the hillside. A collection of odd multi-level buildings and narrow paths, it is great to explore. Only wish we had time to get over to the larger round church but sadly we ran out of time. Lots of photo opportunities and things to see.",
          "First time here: tourists everywhere! If you're looking for new experience, history, trekking then this is the right place! Discovering Matera was an exceptional experience. San Giovanni Battista church reminds me that past, present and future are probably different point of",
          "We travelled to Matera to join up with a cycling tour. Although regular visitors to Italy, we\u2019d never even heard of Matera. Wow, what an omission. One of the oldest cities in the world, the houses in the are all created out of natural caves - our hotel room is one - not a right",
          "We have seen many photos and tv programs on Matera but nothing prepares you for the real thing. Make sure you see it at night as well as during the day as the lighting is spectacular and it takes on a different personality. Its way bigger than I was expecting and the randomness",
          "This truly is one of the most interesting places you will ever visit. There is a reason that this will be the European Capital of Culture in 2019, and I believe that will be the beginning of this city being a major destination for foreign travelers to Italy. A three hour drive",
          "Matera was actually one of the highlights of our trip to southern Italy. It is a truly unique place, and no wonder it is the set of many biblical films. A must see for history buffs...from the \u201cShame of Italy\u201d to a well deserved UNESCO designated city and the Cultural",
          "This is one of the most amazing places I have ever seen. It is a must visit. The cave homes are unbelievable. I was not aware that several films have been made there as it is such a beautiful place. Would highly recommend it. One thing to think about is there are lots of",
          "It's really nice to explore Matera on your own. Wonderful buildings and views, but it's more interesting to walk around with a guide to explain the differences between houses, and to tell you how the town went from inhabited, to abandoned, to trendy now. Worth it to have",
          "It is a place you surely must visit whenever you are in Puglia or Basilicata. It is a special experience you will never forget.",
          "Matera has developed into a worthy cultural and architectural treat. The homes and facilities that developed from early cave dwellings have been preserved and presented effectively as the Sassi di Matera have been re-developed following decades of neglect. The town is a treasure",
          "Half the center city consists of these old houses. Until 1955 people lived there without sanitory, running water or electricity. Often lifestock joined the family. And small these houses are! Nowadays you have several places with an excellent panorama view.",
          "I was recently in Matera on a business trip and was fortunate to stay in the old part of Matera. The town has a wonderful charm and a real old world feeling to it. The rabbit warren of streets and alleyways is a delight to explore as well as the amazing view over the valley.",
          "The city is wonderful and never fed up of looking at the view, wouldn't mid going to Matera over and over..",
          "You can hike to the caves to get a better view for the city, it's amazing to have both halves of the story.",
          "The Sassi is an amazing historical place to visit. The churches are numerous and each of them is unique. The dingy cave homes have been replaced with cafes and eateries. Be prepared to do some walking. It\u2019s well worth it",
          "The many dwellings in the Sassi of Matera were originally dug out about 9000 years ago. It is said that it may be one of the first places of human habitation in Italy. Most of the caves have been repurposed into restaurants, churches, hotels, shops, and private homes. We stayed",
          "Fascinating ancient history of cave dwellers that still retains the 2,000 year old look and feel. Lots of walking up and down stairs and streets with ramps. Is a challenge for those that have difficulty walking. Great views of the river gorge and areas that the Passion of the",
          "This is an interesting city to walk around in. Just walk around the streets and feel what it might have been like. Interesting little museums that you can pay a few Euros to visit. Very clean. Worth the visit",
          "Awesome place to visit, very clean compared to many cities in Italy. Tons of small little things to see. Stop and watch the sparrows chase each other. Tons of stairs and alleys to explore.",
          "Walk through an ancient city of Sassi and secret passages with views of green grass covered mountains and craggy mountains. The city is peaceful and wonderful for walking and learning about the people who built the city and lived in the caves with the families and animals.",
          "The Sassi is like arriving in a time warp back to the middle ages. It's almost impossible to describe the beauty of the location and the cave houses. Well worth a trip to visit. Everyone should come.",
          "I had seen photographs and was fascinated. We did not get to the caves or the Sassi area for a meal because we had bad weather in February and March, but the views are beautiful - I recommend staying at the Palazzo Gattini - it has a beautiful location - just perfect for",
          "This place is indescribable. I\u2019m sure that the pictures do not do it justice as it is really hard to explain unless you experience it. I love this town the most of all I have visited in Italy.",
          "Honestly I have never heard of a place called \"Basilicata\" in Italy before to visit Matera. This small town is very beautiful, the historical center is called \"Sassi\" (means \"stones\") and it is incredible, amazing...a very old town. Never seen something similar in Europe.",
          "This is the most amazing city/township in Italy. If you are in the Southern half of Italy, this is worth the visit. Spend at least 2 nights there.",
          "This place is interesting to visit. You will feel the old way of leaving of this people special if you visit one of the old caves/house. Guided tour can be booked. The city is under modernization and prepared for the 2019 event.",
          "Hidden gem you gotta visit! It\u2019s views are breath taking and the city it quaint and nice. Plenty of parking and safe",
          "super interesting city. worth to explore! lots of streets to stroll around and enjoy this landscape. there are heaps of little restaurants and cafes to stop by.",
          "Very very beautiful. You can also take a drive to the caves which are on the opposite side of the small river if you have a car. It is definitely worth a visit, views are spectacular. There are also some museums in the territory, restaurants and souvenir shops. We spent approx.",
          "Stopped by Matera on our drive from Naples to Lecce. What a unique place the Sassis are. Take a guided tour if you can but easy enough to do it on your own. Not good for the disabled or elderly as a lot of climbing and slippery when wet. Definitely coming back.",
          "It really worth seeing the oldest second city in the world lived continuosly. Amazing view, during day or night!",
          "Just wondering around these incredible dwellings take shoe well back into the past. Many are not open.",
          "Great place, great time! A living, breathing Nativity scene. An italian Jerusalem. PLEASE, just follow the passionate tourist guides' lead into this journey. You are going to find out one of the most incredible part in italian history. A past which still affects the city and",
          "After viewing the Sassi, you feel a sense of humilty. I can't see people of our time enduring the life that the natives here viewed as normal.",
          "I have been to various parts of Italy on different trips. Matera was just stunning and breathtaking. Like stepping back in time. So pretty with history, amazing views, great food amd culture. Stay in the sassi and get lost enjoying the sights. Still new to tourism so go now",
          "No picture represents the real view and feel of this city. Exceptionally cozy, picturesque. Visited in February - out of tourism season - so many places were closed.",
          "The Sassi di Matera are something everyone should see at least once in their life. Considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, Matera is a completely fascinating town. We saw it on a day trip, but it's great if you can spend 2 or 3 days here and",
          "Quiet, not busy and completely magical. Definitely worth a visit. Lots of walking but you really need to get there and explore.",
          "While traveling to Italy, this ancient city is a must to visit. Ancient cave dwellings converted to hotels and businesses. There is no place like it!",

        "wiki": "Bari ( BAR-ee, Italian: [\u02c8ba\u02d0ri] (listen); Barese: Bare [\u02c8b\u00e6\u02d0r\u0259]; Latin: Barium; Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, romanized: B\u00e1rion) is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia  region, on the Adriatic Sea, in southern Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples (and the third after Palermo, if Insular Italy is included), a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of 320,257 inhabitants, over 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), while the  urban area has 750,000 inhabitants. The metropolitan area has 1.3 million inhabitants.\nBari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, the Cathedral of San Sabino (1035\u20131171) and the Hohenstaufen Castle built for Frederick II, which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district (the via Sparano and via Argiro).\nModern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s. The city has a redeveloped airport, Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, with connections to several European cities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe city was probably founded by the Peucetii. The city had strong Greek influences and once it passed under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were dependent on the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAfter the devastations of the Gothic Wars, under Longobard rule a set of written regulations was established, the Consuetudines Barenses, which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities. Until the arrival of the Normans, Bari continued to be governed by the Longobards and Byzantines, with only occasional interruption.\nThroughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major slave depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in Slavic slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by Venice from Dalmatia, the Holy Roman Empire from what is now Prussia and Poland, and the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Fatimid Caliphate (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba Mamluks).For 20 years, Bari was the centre of the Emirate of Bari; the city was captured by its first emirs Kalfun in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by Radelchis I of Benevento. The city was conquered and the Emirate extinguished in 871, due to the efforts of Emperor Louis II and a Byzantine fleet. Chris Wickham states Louis spent five years campaigning to reduce then occupy Bari, \"and then only to a Byzantine/Slav naval blockade\"; \"Louis took the credit\" for the success, adding \"at least in Frankish eyes\", then concludes by noting that by remaining in southern Italy long after this success, he \"achieved the near-impossible: an alliance against him of the Beneventans, Salernitans, Neapolitans and Spoletans; later sources include Sawad\u0101n as well.\" In 885, Bari became the residence of the local Byzantine catapan, or governor. The failed revolt (1009\u20131011) of the Lombard nobles Melus of Bari and his brother-in-law Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the Battle of Cannae (1018), offered their Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted \"provincial\" status.\nIn 1071, Bari was captured by Robert Guiscard, following a three-year siege. Maio of Bari (died 1160), a Lombard merchant's son, was the third of the great admirals of Norman Sicily. The Basilica di San Nicola was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from Myra in Lycia, in Byzantine territory. The saint began his development from Saint Nicholas of Myra into Saint Nicholas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the economy of Bari. In 1095 Peter the Hermit preached the first crusade there. In October 1098, Urban II, who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the Council of Bari, one of a series of synods convoked with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the filioque clause in the Creed, which Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the Great Schism was inevitable.\nA civil war broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by Grimoald Alferanites, a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with Byzantium and Venice and taken the title gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to Roger II of Sicily, but rebelled and was defeated in 1132.\nBari was occupied by Manuel I Komnenos between 1155 and 1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nIsabella d\u2019Aragona, princess of Naples and widow of the Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, enlarged the castle, which she made her residence, 1499\u20131524. After the death of Queen Bona Sforza, of Poland, Bari came to be included in the Kingdom of Naples and its history contracted to a local one, as malaria became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist grid plan, which bears his name today as the Murattiano. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of Mussolini can be seen in the imposing architecture along the seafront.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 11 September 1943, in connection with the Armistice of Cassibile, Bari was taken without resistance by the British 1st Airborne Division, then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.\nThe Balkan Air Force supporting the Yugoslav partisans was based at Bari.\n\n\n==== The 1943 chemical warfare disaster ====\n\nThrough a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in World War II, Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience chemical warfare in the course of that war.\nOn the night of 2 December 1943, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacked the port of Bari, which was a key supply centre for Allied forces fighting their way up the Italian Peninsula. Over 20 Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship John Harvey, which was carrying mustard gas; mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport (the chemical agent was intended for retaliation if German forces had initiated chemical warfare.) The presence of the gas was highly classified and the U.S. had not informed the British military authorities in the city of its existence. This increased the number of fatalities, since British physicians\u2014who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas\u2014prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties, many additional casualties were caused among the rescuers, through contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.\nFollowing the attack, the harbor was closed for operations for three weeks and it did not return to full capacity until February 1944.\nA member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid.  Alexander had trained at the Army's Edgewood Arsenal in New Jersey, and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the John Harvey, and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, Mustine.On the orders of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book Disaster at Bari. Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: \"[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen\". Others put the count as high as \"more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians\".Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed \"The Little Pearl Harbor\" after the Japanese air attack on the American naval base in Hawaii, was highly destructive in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, has proved far from easy.\nThe affair is the subject of two books: Disaster at Bari, by Glenn B. Infield, and Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup, by Gerald Reminick.\nIn 1988 through the efforts of Nick T. Spark, U.S. Senators Dennis DeConcini and Bill Bradley, Dr. Stewart Alexander received recognition from the Surgeon General of the United States Army for his actions during the Bari disaster.\n\n\n==== Charles Henderson explosion ====\nThe port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship Charles Henderson exploded in the harbour while offloading 2000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered nonoperational, this time for a month.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBari is the largest urban and metro area on the Adriatic.  It is located in Southern Italy, at a more northerly latitude than Naples, further south than Rome.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBari has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nShown above are the nine governmental community boards (Municipalities) of Bari: these are further divided into twenty neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\n\nTeatro Margherita.\nTeatro Piccinni.\nOrto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bari, a botanical garden.\nSanta Chiara, once church of the Teutonic Knights (as Santa maria degli Alemanni) and now houses a museum. It was restored in 1539.\nThe Acquedotto Pugliese\nThe medieval church of San Marco dei Veneziani, with a rose window in the fa\u00e7ade.\nConservatory of Bari\nSan Giorgio degli Armeni.\nSanta Teresa dei Maschi, the main Baroque church in the city (1690\u20131696).\nPane e Pomodoro Beach is the main beach within reach of the city. Its reputation has for several years suffered from the apparent presence of asbestos from nearby industrial plants.\nBari features two sea harbours: the Old Port and the New Port, constructed in 1850.\n\n\n==== Basilica of Saint Nicholas ====\n\nThe Basilica di San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from Myra in Lycia, and now lie beneath the altar in the crypt, where are buried the Topins, which are a legacy of old thieves converted to good faith. The church is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia (the others being the cathedrals of Acquaviva delle Fonti and Altamura, and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano).\n\n\n==== Bari Cathedral ====\nBari Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Sabinus of Canosa (San Sabino), was begun in Byzantine style in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170 and 1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the transept.\nAn example of Apulian Romanesque architecture, the church has a simple Romanesque fa\u00e7ade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The crypt houses the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the Madonna Odigitria.\nThe interior and the fa\u00e7ade were redecorated in Baroque style during the 18th century, but these additions were removed in a 1950s restoration.\n\n\n==== Petruzzelli Theatre ====\nThe Petruzzelli Theatre, founded in 1903, hosted different forms of live entertainment, or nineteenth century \u201cPoliteama\u201d.  The theatre was all but destroyed in a fire on October 27, 1991. It was reopened in October 2009, after 18 years.\n\n\n==== Swabian Castle ====\n\nThe Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the Castello Svevo (Swabian Castle), was built by Roger II of Sicily around 1131. Destroyed in 1156, it was rebuilt by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.\n\n\n==== Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari ====\nThe Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari (Provincial Picture Gallery of Bari) is the most important art gallery in Apulia. It was first established in 1928 and contains many paintings from the 15th century up to the days of contemporary art.\n\n\n==== The Russian Church ====\nThe Russian Church of Saint Nicholas, in the Carrassi district of Bari, was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nicholas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.\nThe city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a trade-off with the Putin government in Moscow, exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a military barracks near Bari's central railway station.\n\n\n==== Barivecchia ====\nBarivecchia, or Old Bari, is a sprawl of streets and passageways making up the section of the city to the north of the modern Murat area. Barivecchia was until fairly recently considered a no-go area by many of Bari's residents due to the high levels of petty crime. A large-scale redevelopment plan began with a new sewerage system, followed by the development of the two main squares, Piazza Mercantile and Piazza Ferrarese.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 2015, there were 326,344 people residing in Bari (about 1.6 million live in the greater Bari area), located in the province of Bari, Puglia, of whom 47.9% were male and 52.1% were female. As of 2007, minors (children ages 18 and younger) totaled 17.90 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.08 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Bari residents is 42 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Bari grew by 2.69 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The current birth rate of Bari is 8.67 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.As of 2015, 3.8% of the population was foreign residents.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\nAccording to an urban migration study in Bari, return migration gain to urban areas is higher than migration loss from urban areas. People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy.  Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes. Under 2% of migrants left Bari to go abroad and came to the city from abroad.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Fiera del Levante ===\nThe Fiera del Levante, held in September in the Fiera site on the west side of Bari city center, focuses on agriculture and industry,  There is also a \"Fair of Nations\" which displays handcrafted and locally produced goods from all over the world.\n\n\n=== Cuisine and gastronomy ===\n\nBari's cuisine is based on three typical agricultural products found within the surrounding region of Apulia, namely wheat, olive oil and wine. The local cuisine is also enriched by the wide variety of fruit and vegetables produced locally. Local flour is used in homemade bread and pasta production including, most notably, the famous orecchiette ear-shaped pasta, recchietelle or strascinate, chiancarelle (orecchiette of different sizes) and cavatelli.\nHomemade dough is also used for baked calzoni stuffed with onions, anchovies, capers and olives; fried panzerotti with mozzarella, simple focaccia alla barese with tomatoes, little savoury taralli, friselle and sgagliozze, fried slices of polenta, all make up the Bari culinary repertoire.\nVegetable minestrone, chick peas, broad beans, chicory, celery and fennel are also often served as first courses or side dishes.\nMeat dishes and the local Barese rag\u00f9 often include lamb and pork.\nPasta al forno, a baked pasta dish, is very popular in Bari and was historically a Sunday dish, or a dish used at the start of Lent when all the rich ingredients such as eggs and pork had to be used for religious reasons. The recipe commonly consists of penne or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with mozzarella or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.\nFresh fish and seafood are often eaten raw. Octopus, sea urchins and mussels feature heavily. Perhaps Bari's most famous dish is the oven-baked patate, riso e cozze (potatoes with rice and mussels).\nBari and the whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including Primitivo, Castel del Monte, and Muscat, notably Moscato di Trani.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe dialect of Bari belongs to the upper-southern Italo-Romance  family, and currently coexists with Italian; generally these are used in different contexts.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nLocal football club S.S.C. Bari, currently competing in Serie C (as of the 2019\u20132020 season), plays in the Stadio San Nicola, an architecturally innovative 58,000-seater stadium purpose-built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The stadium also hosted the 1991 European Cup Final.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBari has its own airport, Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, which is located 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of the centre of Bari. It is connected to the centre by train services from Bari Aeroporto railway station.\nBari Central Station lies on the Adriatic railway and has connection to cities such as Rome, Milan, Bologna, Turin and Venice. Another mainline is connection southwards by the Bari-Taranto railway. Regional services also operate to Foggia, Barletta, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto and other towns and villages in the Apulia region.\nBari has an old fishery port (Porto Vecchio) and a so-called new port in the north, as well as some marinas. The Port of Bari is an important cargo transport hub to S.E.Europe. Various passenger transport lines include some seasonal ferry lines to Albania, Montenegro or Dubrovnik. Bari-Igoumenitsa is a popular ferry line to Greece, some cruise ships anchor in Bari too.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bari, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 minutes. 11% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 18 minutes, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km (2.6 mi), while 2% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2014 sister cities ==\n\nBari is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Guido Guerrieri novels by Gianrico Carofiglio are set in Bari, where Guerrieri is a criminal lawyer, and include many descriptions of the town.\nBari is one of the primary settings of the detective novel The Black Mountain by Rex Stout. It is the characters' point of embarkation to Communist Yugoslavia.\nIn the 1995 film The Bridges of Madison County, Italian housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), is mentioned as being from Bari and growing up in Naples.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccademia Apulia\nAntivari (means \"opposite Bari\")\nBari Light, the Punta San Cataldo di Bari Lighthouse\nDurres\nPolytechnic University of Bari\nProvince of Bari\nUniversity of Bari\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nGlenn B.

          "An absolute must see if you visit Bari. Loads to see and do around the Basillica too. We had lunch close by in one of the many restaurants. You could spend a day wondering around the old streets and all the shops.",
          "Most of the internal bling has been stripped out, leaving a more attractive place of worship for the faithful. The crypt at our time of visit was full of orthodox believers so we were unable to see the bones.",
          "This church is a must see if you are in Bari. A church built in romanesc stile with impressive painted ceiling and asymetric arches, hosting the tomb and relics of Saint Nicholas. A free of charge place of art and pray.",
          "Very impressive ceiling. Well worth a look to appreciate the skills needed to produce such work. Statue of the Saint was a bit unnerving. I found it quite disturbing. I am not religious in any way but can appreciate the architecture of magnificent churches and the treasures they",
          "Nothing special unless you are a religious person which we are not. Big cathedral and the way there is filled with tourist trap stuff.",
          "Loved being here and seeing this citadel. From the floor to ceiling this citadel is a master peace. Loved being here and walking through.",
          "This basilica is impressively large, with a simple, yet beautiful facade. We didn't enter, as it was closed, but it was a nice view.",
          "Visited here by guided tour. Beautiful architecture and great history in centre of bari. Very nice at night and don't miss to visit the crypt",
          "Well worth a visit. The remains of Saint Nicholas are there and it is the spiritual place of Bari. The ceiling in the Basilica is spectacular.",
          "The North Pole may be the physical home of Santa but this is his spiritual home.The ceiling has beautiful art to rival that of the Sistene Chapel. A lovely experience.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Very impressive decorated ceiling. Also go down to where his tomb is located. Charming pedestrian streets all around.",
          "Surprised by how light this building was inside - fantastic as it allowed great views of the architecture and the decoration. Also surprised that we were allowed in during Sunday morning Mass, which lovely as it added to the atmosphere of this beautiful building",
          "The basilica was finish in 1197, during the Italo-Norman domination of Apulia, Its foundation is related to the recovery of some of the relics of Saint Nicholas from the saint\u2019s original shrine in Myra, in what is now Turkey. When Myra passed into the hands of the Saracens,",
          "At first entrance to the church nothing seem very special. We have seen many churches throughout Italy. Then we saw a stairway and a sign that said crypt. This was also not unusual. We don't usually visit the crypts as they are often very similar, but we had time and decided to",
          "Absolutely wonderfuland peaceful place! Everything is special there, the atmosphere is asif a miracleis about to happen!",
          "When one has been around the web of narrow streets and alleys of Citta Antica, overhung with washing and overburdened by the havoc of time, one will comprehend that the Church of San Nikola is part of the canvas if it does not also embody it. It personifies the city\u2019s",
          "Such a beautiful place, and kind of random to just pass down tiny streets and find such a huge building in the heart of old town. It\u2019s lovely inside, so quiet despite the Bose sound system along the pillars, haha. Quite lovely, and eerie!",
          "Although often deluged with crowds, it is difficult not to be impressed by the square, castle-like appearance of the Romanesque basilica. The vaulted and beautifully decorated crypt is reputed to be the final resting place of the bones of Saint Nicholas aka Santa Claus.",
          "This Basilica is massive. It is not very colourful, infact it looks quiet bare, but there is something that makes this Basilica look very holy. Then you go to the crypt, and it is completely different, it's very ornate and with a lot of colourful marble. There were a lot of",
          "Very striking church with gorgeous architecture. Typical Norman squareness in the bones, but Byzantine and Romanesque adornments throughout. Make sure you see the crypt with St. Nicholas as well.",
          "A must see in Bari - just set up a credible cover story if visiting with little children \ud83d\ude09. Spectacular interiors and the crypt with the remains of the Saint, and the accompanying icon are very evocative.",
          "Great church with great inside architecture. The interior is spectacular and San Nicola\u2019s tomb was breathtaking... with all the decorations and beautiful paintings.. the ceiling of the church is great to look at.. I visited it by night so it was not crowded. A must visit if you",
          "There is a mystical, holy blessed atmosphere in the St. Nicholas church. With Christmas lights it's even more special. I also recommend everyone to visit the crypt.",
          "Breathtakiingly beautiful! a very sacred place to visit. Thank you Giorgio, Apulia Tours, for making our trip so memorable and all the information you knew on this Basilica.",
          "We've visited Bari especially for Basilica San Nicola. The church absolutely beautiful and peaceful. The most amazing about this place that you feel the unity of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians.",
          "Beautiful Basilica San Nicola. Wonderful architecture. We were longing to visit this beautiful church and its so quiet and peaceful.",
          "This ranks high on our list of beautiful churches, but the crypt is what sets it apart as a stunning place not to be missed. Take your time to observe and appreciate all the details in both the crypt and main basilica.",
          "This church has a surprising interior, well worth a visit. It is shared by Roman Catholics and Russians. What makes it more interesting is that there are plenty of information plaques for you to read all about its history. These are written in Italian, Russian and English. There",
          "The church of San Nicola had a very interesting story. It was a very culturally enriching experience.",
          "Originally built between 1087 and 1197, during the Italo-Norman domination of Apulia, to house the relics of San Nicola, the legendary saint, whose kindness led to the idea of Father Christmas. On the exterior the basilica could be a Norman castle as it was used for in two",
          "Visited the Basilica on a Sunday evening when in town for a meeting. There was an evening mass on, which made it extra special, but both interior and exterior require a visit, especially Dutch/Belgian to visit Sinterklaas!",
          "Hey, where else can you even get close to the remains of Saint Nicholas? A spectacular sight, full of history and legend, not to mention the obvious riches. The ceiling and the crypt are highlights but the surrounding area is full of many more...",
          "While visiting Bari, you will obviously come across this Basilica San Nicola. To my observation not the most architectural or the prettiest of buildings , but you really must enter. Inside, you will see as a beautiful interior. but sadly I, and many others were unable to look",
          "Unusual in that the ground floor is used by Roman Catholics and the crypt by Russian Orthodox . Whilst we were there a Russian naming ceremony was taking place in the crypt, interesting but we felt that we were intruding a bit. Well worth a visit.",
          "Impressive church very beautiful architecture. The inside of the church is simple but with beautiful paintings.",
          "Beautiful church! We were able to join a service in the basement, which was lovely. The church has different parts to explore and is free of entrance.",
          "One of the must see in Bari. Beautiful architecture, almost looks like a castle. The foundation is related to the recovery of some of the relics of St. Nicolas.",
          "Interesting visit. Nice view. A piece of history...we enjoyed the underneath of the church, the museum and all the conservation done...",
          "It is good to see. It is simething else than the ones i saw before. I am not a big fan of this kind of things, but at least now I know how it is inside. Being a key point in Bari, it is worth to check this our.",
          "Sadly we could only stand in awe of this magnificent Basilica a it was closed and we were bitterly disappointed. I cannot understand how this can be so! There were many visitors in the piazza and it was a shame that there was no entry.",
          "Happy I took the time to walk into the old town district of Bari and saw this beautiful ancient building. Nearby in one of the little streets a private resident has set up a beautiful nativity scene in their home. That was a highlight for me. Loved all the cute side streets",
          "Probably the number 1 attraction in Bari. An important place for religion, a great architectural sight and a quiet place to gather your thoughts. It is located in the old city and is not difficult to locate. Inside a beautiful ceiling, some very old wall paintings, a modest and",
          "Wow, beautiful church with fantastic painted ceiling. Free entrance, as a church should be, but donations well worth it. The tomb of St Nicola is pretty busy, but worth seeing. There was a marriage when I arrived, which was great to see also. If you are in Bari it is a MUST!!",
          "This is definitely not what you'd expect from an Italian church, but it is definitely rich in history. The Crypt, on the the other hand, is amazing and you get the see the believers worshiping San Nicola.",
          "The basilica San Nicola illustrates the rich history of Bari, the encounter between differents cultures and architecture styles. It is a must for anyone who is interested in Italian history. The facade is simply marvelous, at the same time, simple and refined",
          "The Basilica San Nicola is beautiful and looks particularly impressive at night, when it is lit up. Definitely worth the walk through.",
          "Old St Nicholas is the patron of this church. He was an early Christian Bishop in Asia Minor, now Turkey, who lived up to his legend today. Patron of single women wishing to marry. Great treat to visit.",
          "Not a believer, but interested in churches. However, this is nothing out of the ordinary, until you go don to the crypt. Very elegant and stylish. A place for reverence if you are a believer. I'm no, but it angers me that people jut want to snap photos. If you come here respect",
          "This church is a place of pilgrimage for many and respects are paid to some of the remains of St Nicholas. They are housed in the crypt and while we visited there was a large number of pilgrims which was fascinating to watch. The basilica itself is well decorated, with a",
          "Beautiful church, but so touristy that it gets irritating (people photographing with flash, groups talking loudly, people wearing hats and getting reprimanded). Also, consider the fact that the bones of St. Nicholas were stolen from Turkey 1,000 years ago. So much for respect.",
          "This church is more famous than the cathedral due to the tomb of St. Nicholas. The age of the building is not obscured by embellishments of the 17th century like many. It is massive and simple, impressive and straight-forward.",
          "This is Santa Claus's forever home! :) St. Nicolas is burried under the church altar. The upper side is catholic church and in the basement orthodox.",
          "Called in here mainly to get out of the heat for a while, some of the architecture is very good, there is also crypt. A few beggars sitting on the steps outside and priests walking straight by them and the first thing you see when you walk in is a room with money all over the",
          "One of the best churches I\u2019ve seen the tomb of Saint Nicole ant the streets near by its located at the old bari",
          "Nice Architecture and Nice story about how and why it was built. No comments about the story about St. Nicolas bones yet it is a nice one",
          "Spent so much time looking up in the Basilica, the ceiling is fantastic. Make sure you visit the crypt also.",
          "This is truly a mystic place, in a very wide square in the heart of Citt\u00e0 Vecchia. Inside is amazing and the crypt is breathless.There, both Catholic and Orthodox services are performed, so you can find people praying in many languages.",
          "The basilica was built between 1087 and 1197 and today is an important pilgrimage destination both Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians from Eastern Europe.",
          "The church is well worth seeing, very beautiful ceiling, Norman arches, remains of the saint in the crypt.",
          "The basilica is dedicated to St. Nicholas, whose relics are kept in the crypt. Crusaders secured the relics in the middle age from the muslims and brought them to Bari. Particularly the ceiling painting and the simple beauty of the church impress the observer. In the crypt you",
          "Very unusual basilica with great history. If you are christian and you are in Bari its the must visit place. Its one of few churches where catholic and orthodox are together.",
          "Basilica San Nicola is a very interesting place to visit, especially for ortodox people. Looks great both outside and inside.",
          "We actually read about it after we visited. It has the remains of St. Nicholas, who inspired the origin of Santa Claus. You should read about the legends and stories of this saint before going inside.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the church. A church is a church. What made this one different is not the church but going downstairs and watch the many Russian pilgrims queuing up to be blessed. This really makes it different from your average church visit. Also the statue of St Nicolas on",
          "In the city of Bari, it\u2019s 28 curch, this Basillica of Nicolaus it\u2019s the most imported off Bari!! Veri Beutiful to visit !",
          "The cathedral of Saint Nicholas is simple but beautiful. It has an upper part, Catholic and the crypt, Orthodox. It was moving to visit at the time of Mass and observe the culture and faith of those attending. St. Nick is here so best not to bring the kids,\ud83e\udd29",
          "Definetly the number 1 attraction here in Bari. An important place for religion, a great architectural sight and a quiet ppace to gather your thoughts and pray. It is located in the old city and it is easy to come by. You can see it over the buildings when you get closer. Inside",
          "The Catholic/Orthodox shared church is interesting, as is the walk through the old town to get there! Very real, and apparently very safe during our day trip",
          "Worth visiting, especially for strongly religious people. There is a shop right to the cathedral where you can buy beautiful presents for friends/family.",
          "Beautiful basilica in old part of town. We were inside and it has so many historical details. I could explore it whole day.",
          "Beautiful location and impressive to visit; not as touristic as I had feared it to be. Especially the crypte is an experience.",
          "A very moving church with done excellent history we went with the family and everyone was touched by it\u2019s beauty the crypt is a must",
          "I stumbled upon this wondering through the alleys of old town area. Neat to see the paintings and architecture of the church. Go into the basement tomb too.",
          "We went here and they were having mass despite all of the tourists in the area. What a beautiful basilica! Loved exploring the surrounding area as well. Bari was very walkable.",
          "You simply have to see the Basilica of St Nicholas if you are in Bari. An impressive building and all the more interesting as Catholic masses are held on the ground floor and Orthodox services take place in the crypt.",
          "There are some local shops as well, you can buy some cute stuff.... Restaurants have usually an amazing food, well priced and don't miss the local wine....",
          "The basilica is one of the best sights in Bari. Be sure to visit the grotto/ crypt beneath the sanctuary!",
          "We were strolling around Bari old town and got to see this bascilica. It\u2019s pretty impressive and the building is really tall. St. Nicolas was buried here. It\u2019s not gaudy as some of tge other churches we had been to in Italy.",
          "An impressive cathedral, dating back to the 10th century, later updated with various styles. Do read up on the stories around St Nicolas before visiting.",
          "Unique because this exquisite church is a meca for Orthodox pilgrims and tourists alike and arguably Bari's No. 1 tourist attraction. But it isn't Bari's cathedral and not the seat of the bishop or centre of the Church in the area. It was built to house the relics of St Nicolas",
          "Amazing place with beautiful architecture. The interior is spectacular and San Nicola\u2019s tomb was breathtaking especially since there was a service in process when we visited. A must visit if you are travelling to Bari.",
          "We stumbled across this cathedral by chance whilst wandering around the old part of the city. Actually we thought we\u2019d already been to this cathedral but it turned out to be for a rival saint! This one is fascinating as it\u2019s both Catholic and Russian Orthodox (for some reason)",
          "This is the basilica of Bari\u2019s patron saint (although there is a rival saint in San Sabino). The most fascinating aspect of this site is that it serves two religious traditions, the Roman Catholic and the Russian Orthodox. Saint Nicholas is revered in both, and a relic (a piece",
          "A very interesting church and less gaudy than I was expecting. The crypt was a bit crowded but I expected that as the remains of Saint Nicholas are there. I would recommend a visit.",
          "The relics of the Saint were brought here by the Normans in 1045? or thereabouts. The massive Cathedral is a practicing Catholic Church. On the lower level a practicing Orthodox Curch exists with many Russian Orthodox Christian Pilgrims coming all year. If your not a religious",
          "Right at the heart of this lovely Italian town. Take time to visit the wonderfully crypt in quiet contemplation.",
          "After three years I am back here. Same place, some peaceful in mind place. Cekling of church is pure spectacular: carved golden wood and religious thema of painting. Underground are the remains of San Nicola, protector of Bari. Sometime religious music are here. Sometime the",
          "The best of this church is the roof with a great work in the carved golden wood. Also in the basement has a russian church with some byzantine icons.",
          "The outside walls are pristine white. You can go into the lower part where the sarcophagus of St Nicola is located and it was packed with devotees so I could only see from a distance . The inside was a pleasant change from the many Baroque churches. Entrance is free.",
          "I went twice because this is a very special place. The tomb in the crypt which has been there since 1087 (the remains of St Nicholas were bought here for safety; he originally died in Turkey in the 4th century) is an amazing, atmospheric place. I also attended High Sung Mass on",
          "What a church, history like this well worth visiting. Best to have a guide take you in so you can appreciate the history of the place. Amazing decorative ceiling panels. Regards David B",
          "I don't visit old churches so much any more. I was glad I walked into this one. It has a very interesting interior with lots to see and admire - art wise.",
          "Finished in 1197, this beautiful church, with its mostly square shape was built of limestone. The interior has a unique architecture and the ceiling is stunning. At almost one thousand years old, it is a must see.",
          "It's located in the city centre so getting there is actually nice walk. One of the main sights, can't miss it if you go walking in the old city.",
          "I highly recommend to visit the San Nicola Basilica on Thursday morning, the saint's relics of Sint Nicolas are open one day a week.",
          "We were very impressed by this beautiful basilica and the way it had been restored to it's original state by stripping it of the baroque transformations which had been added.",
          "The best thing is the century old catacomb where Saint Nicolas has been buried. This Basilica is a must see when visiting Bari.",
          "With all the discussion about colonial and slave heritage, I like to see that San Nicola was brown, not white or black. Simple church but nice statue of San Nicola and interesting crypte.",
          "In this church you have to LOOK UP to see the magnificent art work on the ceiling. The sheer size of the church from the outside makes for a great photo op of you looking the size of an ant! Try to get there before tours from the cruise ship for this (between 1-3:30 when most",
          "Beautiful basilica with a wonderfully decorated ceiling and a very atmospheric underground catacomb.",
          "Beautiful place for visiting. I recommend! Do not forget to raise your head and enjoy the beauty of the ceiling painting",
          "I am an Orthodox and getting to \"meet\" Saint Nicholas was very important to me; the crypt is welcoming and inviting to prayer - however, if you are there only for the tourism, you can still have a wonderful experience thanks to the lovely elegant Romanesque architecture and",
          "Not to miss beautiful cathedral built to remember san Nicolas or as we know him, the original Santa Claus. Go downstairs where the oldest part is and the tomb. The old columns are still in great shape.",
          "Great church containing both Catholic and Orthodox parts. Very nice icon of St. Nicholas donated by Serbian king.",
          "Kind of typical medieval church except that this San Nicola is dark skinned. Interesting and enjoyed Mass too.",
          "This is a Catholic church run by Dominican priests, but its most visited section, the crypt with the tomb of Saint Nicholas of Myra (yes, THE Santa Claus!), has many Byzantine Orthodox elements, including a small iconostasis St. Nicholas is one of the most venerated saints in",
          "It doesn\u2019t look much from the outside but the beauty is all held within. The ceiling is stunning. The remains of St Nicholas are here and there is also some wood, believed to be from Jesus\u2019 cross. We aren\u2019t religious but did find the basilica absolutely beautiful. The crypts",
          "We have been to San Nicola on several visits to Bari, and never tire of the atmosphere inside, from the beautiful, simple Norman architecture to the amazing crypt with the tomb of San Nicola. I always marvel at the simple but attractive spacious nature of the nave, supported by",
          "The Basilica of St. Nicholas was built in the 11th and 12th century. The reason for the church was to house the relics of St. Nicholas which were taken from Myra, Turkey when it was invaded by the Saracens. The inside looks basically white washed because it had been redecorated",
          "Sorry if I\u2019m harsh, is just a bit of objectivity. San Nicola and Bari in general are not particularly interesting. Italy is full of amazing cities and town, with fascinating architecture and natural beauty. Bari is simply not one of them and as a consequence (my speculation) is",
          "Interesting church to visit in Bari the ceilings of this Basilica make the place different so worth a visit",
          "What a wonderful experience to celebrate mass on Easter Sunday in this magnificent cathedral. A lovely feel and welcoming congregation. Thank you.",
          "Very close to the sea and very easy to find on Maps, the church is beautiful. We viseted it on Palm Sunday while there was a Georgian (I think) service. I vas very happy to find orthodox candles there, and I took my time to say my prayes. Felt really in peace there.",
          "The Basilica and nearby museum are both well worth a visit. Loved the architecture, the history and the insight into this very old part of Italy.",
          "Very Impressive building. Nice architecture. Very close to sea shore. Many souvenir shops close to it.",
          "We went there while our short stay in Bari. A beautiful place in the middle of the old town. You should visit the crypt",
          "It's beautiful Basilica, i think anyone must go and see it if they pass from there. It's tourist attraction.",
          "St Nicholas was from Turkey but is the patron saint of Bari. He is the protector of the children and unmarried women. The ground level floor is Christian while the lower lever is Orthodox, and this is where you will find his crypt (and his bones).",
          "Square beyond San Nicola, Bari Vecchia, on a narrow peninsula by the port, dates from the medieval times, nice architecture, twisting streets, there are many restaurants, full of caf\u00e9s; it's a large historic center and very visited.",

          "This basilica is dedicated to San Nicola, his patron, and in summer times in May, for the Sant Nicolas festival, and becomes the focus of attention for many pilgrims;",
          "A very modest Basilica. It is made of light colored stone. Underneath the altar you have a more interesting area.",
          "I liked his statue, but my beard is way cooler than his. The rest of the Basilica was very interesting especially the lower part which seems to be Orthodox. The structural features of the columns hold an interesting history, I am sure.",
          "Well maintained church with stunning crypt from 1000+ years ago with altar, icons and paintings focussing on St Nicholas. Every surface clear of dust and beautifully polished. Chapel for relics also very impressive.",
          "What a mix of simple and baroque. My first experience of an Orthodox Church in the crypt (closer to hell?) and Catholic above. Totally beautiful place and a great prevalence to experience.",
          "We aren't dealing here with a church as spectacular as, say, the Gothic cathedrals of France or Florence or Siena or Milan, but with an older, sober, dignified Romanesque building with an important history and special meaning for southern Italians and Russians (St Nicholas is a",
          "Perhaps the symbol of Bari, the Church of Saint Nicholas attracts pilgrims from all over the world every year. While I didn't go there in a pilgrimage, I could not skip this church. It's beautiful both from the inside and the outside, with very nice paintings on the ceiling and",
          "Even though the final resting place of St Nicholas may not be as opulent as one may expect, it is the significance of the place that gives it atmosphere. The cathedral is a bit austere with an incredibly contrasting ornate ceiling. In the crypt is the tomb of St.Nicholas, where",
          "This was our second visit but always a must see if visiting Bari. The internal architecture is impressive as is the unique facade of this basilica.",
          "Great to see the resting place of St Nicolas. A wonderful cathedral. Located in a small square an easy walk from the centre of town, the crypt is well worth seeing.",
          "Visit before Christmas. Quiet atmosphere. There is the tomb of Sant Nicolas. Placed in the old town of Bari.",
          "Arriving to San Nicola from the narrow streets of the historical center is always a surprise. With its magnificent facade appears as a giant in the middle of the medieval city. Don't forget to visit the crypt and the bizantine chapel.",
          "I was dreaming about visiting this place for a couple of years. Finally I got there this year. It was more than I was expected. The basilica is well located in the middle of the Old Town. There is an easy access to get inside. It is also easy to go to the tomb of Saint Nicolas.",
          "Nice church. Simply and not so big for the capital of mediteranian Italy. You can see Sf Nicolae tomb",
          "A landmark cathedral for Bari. Of course one must see it but shouldn't be burdened with great expectations. It is pretty ascetic. A little bit of twist comes from the single sculpture of St. Nicolas. Not really interesting.",
          "A translucent ceremony. Auster with constrained baroqueness. Fine granite columnade. No frilly imagery. Spacious. An odd cathedral with reconstituted originality. Access portal wide and open. An exercise in serene religiosity with fine materials mostly elemental.",
          "I never knew the history of Saint Nicolas and coming here and seeing his statue and church was really amazing",
          "It is a historically place very calm and cool. Full of history and safe. We went inside and learnt about the place. It is a church of Roman Catholic. The church was restored in thirteenth century. This place is important for Christians because of Saint Nicholas 4th century",
          "In the middle of Bari old town. Very easy to find and has free entry. The architecture is impressive, particularly the ceiling. Just stunning. And dont forget the down floor. You have to visit the crypt downstairs.",
          "Fabulous day out lots of interesting history busy place can do official tour or take yourself around",
          "Lovely is an understatement. An impressive structure that is imposing on the small square in front of it. The stonework is a joy to behold. The inside is equally captivating. A must see.",
          "Recommend to visit the ancient basilica San Nicola. Beautiful church and you can see the ancient pieces of art ...And leave the letter to San Nicola with your wishes",
          "The only thing I would tell you is that you should not buy a gelato right next to the church, the prices there are incredibly high",
          "Built between 1087 and 1197, this basilica has both western Christian and Byzantine influences. It is so characteristic of the various cultures and influences that crossed southern Italy. In addition to seeing the church itself, stay to participate in a service to better",

          "The cathedral has been redecorated , not always in a consistent style. A few places the old frescos are visible , that saves the impression a bit",
          "Beautiful church in Bari, The crypts are amazing. There were people singing when we were there, added to the experience.",

        "wiki": "Pino Pascali (19 October 1935 \u2013 11 September 1968) was an Italian artist, sculptor, set designer and performer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nPino Pascali was born on October 19, 1935 in Bari, Italy. In 1955, Pascali left the science-oriented school that he attended in Bari, and went to a secondary school specialized in the arts in Naples. Later, in 1956, he enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma, on the scenic design course held by Peppino Piccolo with the help of his assistant Fabio Vergoz. He also studied under the guidance of Toti Scialoja, whose open teaching approach encouraged students to experiment with diverse mediums and forms. In the context of the Accademia, Pascali met fellow Arte Povera artist Jannis Kounellis. Pascali also took part in a number of collective shows for young artists: 1956, the Painting Exhibition at the Istituto Tommaseo di Tivoli; 1956, Second Exhibition \"Pennello d'argento\" at the Circolo Culturale dell Vittorie in Rome; 1959, Scenic Design Show, at the 2nd Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. Before Pascali graduated in 1959 he worked as an assistant scenic designer in many RAI productions and additionally collaborated with the Studio Saraceni, Lodolofilm and Incom as a set designer, graphic design, scriptwriter, and creative writer for television advertising, making sketches, creating characters and shorts for the ads.In the early 1960s, Pascali exhibited his sculptures in a number of art exhibitions. In 1965 Pascali exhibited at Galleria La Tartaruga. In January 1968, he had an exhibition at the Galleria Ars Intermedia in Cologne, Germany.Pascali died at the age of thirty-two on September 11, 1968 in Rome, Italy, following a tragic motorcycle accident. His short career has served as an important contribution to post-war art.\n\n\n== Works ==\nIn 1965, Pascali had a solo exhibition at the Galleria La Tartaruga in Rome, Italy.  It was through this exhibition that he first showed his \u201cfake sculptures,\u201d a series of shaped-canvases that first appear to be solid sculptures but are actually paintings that present abstract forms suggesting animals, plants and landscapes. One of Pascali's \"fake sculptures\" was Decapitazione delle giraffe, or Decapitation of the giraffes. Here a structure of wood was created to resemble a skeleton which was then covered with canvas to represent skin. Other sculptures in this series included, Decapitazione della sculptura or Decapitation of the sculpture, (1966), and Mare or Sea, (1966). Pascali's other works involving canvas include Grande bacino di donna, mons Venus, ( Large woman's pelvis, mons Venus) 1964, and Labbra rosse, ( Red lips) 1964.  These works were large flat canvases that became three-dimensional sculptures through the use of wooden structures, paint, and other materials, though they were still able to be hung on the wall. Many of these sculptures were references to popular culture of the time. Soon before, Pascali had created his \u201cArmi series,\u201d or \"Weaponry\" (1965\u201366). Assembled from found materials and painted olive-green, these sculptures faithfully recreate every detail of the weapon it mimics. However, as the weapon cannot fire or kill, it becomes an innocent, oversized toy.\n\nI was born in 1935. The first games I played were based most of all on war. My toys were piles of objects found in the house, which represented weapons. For example, a bean became a bullet, a broomstick and a box held together with a rubber band became a rifle, a rolled-up piece of paper tied to a stool was a cannon, a saucepan was a helmet, two pieces of wood nailed together were a sabre, three pieces of wood an aeroplane and so on. The way I played with other children was largely based on the war-heroism representation of the grown-ups (our fathers were at war)\nThe quote above by Pascali, shows the roots of the strong connection of these war items as toys to a strong war presence in his childhood.\nOpposite to the \u201cArmi series\u201d in appearance, Pascali presented organic forms in a dream-like universe that, like the \u201cfake sculptures,\u201d play on the relationship between illusion and reality.\nAnother famous sculpture by Pascali is the 32 m\u00b2 di mare circa, or Approximately 32 m\u00b2 of sea. Done in 1967 this sculpture consists of 30 shallow \"trays\" containing dyed blue water. These tiles were placed adjacently of the floor, except for 6 where a zig-zag path was created so that the viewer could walk through this \"sea\" that Pascali has created for them. This influence of the mirror-esque quality of water can be seen in his other works, Fiume, (River), Fiume con foce tripla, (River with triple estuary), Acque stagnanti, (Stagnant waters), and Canali d'irrigazione, (Irrigation canals).\n\n\n== Art market ==\nIn 2016, Pascali\u2019s Code di Delfino (1996), a canvas on a wooden structure, was sold at Christie's London for a record \u00a32.2million (\u00a32.6 million with fees).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "A trullo (plural, trulli) is a traditional Apulian dry stone hut with a conical roof. Their style of construction is specific to the Itria Valley, in the Murge area of the Italian region of Apulia. Trulli were generally constructed as temporary field shelters and storehouses or as permanent dwellings by small proprietors or agricultural labourers. In the town of Alberobello, in the province of Bari, whole districts contain dense concentrations of trulli. The golden age of trulli was the nineteenth century, especially its final decades, which were marked by the development of wine growing. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere are many theories behind the origin of the design. One of the more popular theories is that due to high taxation on property, the people of Apulia built dry stone wall constructions so that they could be dismantled quickly when tax inspectors were in the area.\nIn available historical records from the mid-fourteenth century to the late sixteenth century, the area of Alberobello is referred to mostly as selva (\"forest\") and occasionally, as a land from which grazing animals were excluded. Evidence is lacking as to the existence of dwellings in the area prior to the seventeenth century.A Plan of the Territory of Mottala drawn by Donato Gallerano in 1704 reveals the existence of a nucleus of trulli in the midst of a large wood, making up the initial settlement of Arbore bello (\"beautiful tree\").In a geographical map drawn by Giovanni Antonio Rizzi Zannoni in 1808, one may see the selva of Alberobello and, in the midst of it, a clearing with a settlement pattern of scattered houses that bears a striking resemblance to the present-day urban pattern.In an 1897 photograph of the rione Monti (the district of the Mounts), the trulli are far less densely packed than today, being surrounded by enclosed gardens.The urban trulli  still extant in Alberobello date from the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After having undergone a process of densification in the first decades of the twentieth century, the trulli settlements began to be deserted during the second half of the twentieth century.\nThe rural trulli, on cheaper land, ceased to be built when the cost of labour began to rise in the twentieth century. The sheer expense of handling the hundreds of tons necessary for a single house became prohibitive.\n\n\n== From the casedda to the trullo ==\nThe Italian term trullo (from the Greek word \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, cupola) refers to a house whose internal space is covered by a dry stone corbelled or keystone vault. Trullo is an italianized form of the dialectal term, truddu, used in a specific area of the Salentine peninsula (i.e. Lizzaio, Maruggio, and Avetrana, in other words, outside the Murgia dei Trulli proper), where it is the name of the local agricultural dry stone hut. Trullo has replaced the local term casedda (pl. casedde) (Italian casella, pl. caselle), which was used by locals in the Murgia to call this type of house.A stonemason specializing in the building of trulli is a trullisto or trullaro in Italian. The corresponding dialectal term is caseddaro (caseddari in the plural), i.e. builder of casedde.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe style of construction is specific to the Itria Valley, in the Murge area of the Italian region of Apulia. Trulli may be found in and out of Alberobello, and in the areas around Locorotondo, Fasano, Ostuni, Cisternino, Martina Franca, and Ceglie Messapica.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Murgia is a karst plateau. Winter rains drain through the soil into fissures in the strata of limestone bedrock and flow through underground watercourses into the Adriatic. There is no permanent surface water, and water for living purposes must be trapped in catchment basins and cisterns. The surface forms a landscape of rolling hills and ridges punctuated now and again with dolines and other forms of enclosed depressions characteristic of karsts.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Grouping ===\nThe trullo is essentially a rural building type. With its thick walls and its inability to form multi-storey structures, it is wasteful of ground space and consequently ill-suited to high density settlement. Being constructed of small stones, however, it has a flexibility and adaptability of form making the design most helpful in tight urban situations.In the countryside, trullo domes were built singly or in groups of up to five, or sometimes, in large farmyard clusters of a dozen or two dozen, but never for the occupancy of more than a single rural family.\n\n\n=== Materials ===\n\nDepending on the area, the building material used could be either hard limestone or calcareous tufa.\n\n\n=== Masonry ===\nTraditionally trulli were built using dry stone masonry, i.e. without any mortar or cement. This style of construction also is prevalent in the surrounding countryside where most of the fields are separated by dry-stone walls.\n\n\n=== Walls ===\nIn Alberobello, the structural walls of a trullo are laid directly on the bedrock, after removal of the topsoil when necessary. Their width varies from 0.80 metres to 2.70 metres (a measure recorded in the Trullo Sovrano). Their height (from ground level to where the vault starts) ranges from 1.60 metres to 2 metres. Their exterior facing has a 3 to 5% batter.\n\n\n=== Underground cistern ===\nThe stones needed for starting to build a trullo were provided by digging a cistern (cisterna), an absolute necessity in an area devoid of water. The cistern was capped with a lime-mortared barrel vault or dome that in many cases, supported the floor of the house.\n\n\n=== Roofs ===\n\nThe roofs are constructed in two skins: an inner skin of limestone voussoirs, capped by a closing stone, and an outer skin of limestone slabs that are slightly tilted outwardly, ensuring that the structure is watertight. The roof stones may be taken away without compromising the stability of the rest of the building.\n\n\n=== Plans ===\nThe trullo may take on a circular or a square plan. The circular trullo is mostly a temporary shelter for animals and their fodder, or, for the peasant himself.\nThe trullo that is part of a grouping of three, four, or five follows a squarish plan. It may serve as a kitchen, bedroom, animal shelter, store room for food or tools, oven, or cistern, as the case may be.In Alberobello, groupings did not exceed two trulli, as evidenced by nineteenth-century notarial deeds.\n\n\n=== Pinnacles ===\nIn Alberobello, atop the cone of a trullo, there is normally a hand-worked sandstone pinnacle (pinnacolo), that may be one of many designs: disk, ball, cone, bowl, polyhedron, or a combination thereof, that is supposed to be the signature of the stonemason who built the trullo.\n\n\n=== Whitewashed symbols ===\n\nAdditionally, the cone may have a symbol painted on it (as shown in the picture of the trulli in Alberobello.) Such symbols may include Christian symbols such as a simple cross, a cross on a heart pierced by an arrow (representing Santa Maria Addolorata (\"Our Lady of Sorrows\"), a circle divided into four quarters with the letters S, C, S, D in them (for Sanctus Christus and Sanctus Dominus according to one source, but more likely, the initials of Santo Cosma and Santo Damiano, the two saints to whom the local basilica is dedicated) and quite a few others.\nThe symbols now visible on a row of trulli in via Monte Pertica (cross, pierced heart, host with rays radiating from it, tree, dove symbolising the Holy Spirit, and crescent with a cross) were painted only in the late twentieth century and the early 2000s when the roof cones were renovated.The quaint symbols that grace the trullo-like cones of bungalows at the Hotel dei Trulli in Alberobello first appeared in the late 1950s, when the hotel resort was built.\n\n\n=== Interiors ===\n\nThe vast majority of trulli have one room under each conical roof, with additional living spaces in arched alcoves. Children would sleep in alcoves made in the wall with curtains hung to separate them from the central room.\nA multi-room trullo house has many cones, each representing a separate room.\nAlong with its exterior wall, a trullo's interior room and vault intrados often were rendered with lime plaster and whitewashed for protection against drafts.The trulli used as dwellings all have an open fireplace complete with a flue (hidden in the masonry) and a stone-built chimney stack (rising high above the roof). Because of their design, trulli are difficult to heat: the walls are very thick and warm air will rise up the interior cone. An alternative heating solution was to use a central brasero with embers in it (a specimen may be seen in Alberobello's Museo del Territorio).\nThe thick stone walls and dome of the trullo that cool pleasantly during the summer, tend to become unpleasantly cold during the winter months, condensing the moisture given off by cooking and breathing, making it difficult to feel warm even in front of the fire. The inhabitants simply leave the doors open during the day to keep the interior dry, and live more outdoors than in.In trulli that were used as stables, the troughs the animals fed from may still be seen.\n\n\n=== Windows ===\nOwing to the concentration of houses, trulli have few openings except for their doorway and a small aperture provided in the roof cone for ventilation. As a result, it can be quite dark inside.\n\n\n=== Fa\u00e7ades ===\nSome trullo houses have had their perimeter walls raised substantially so that their cones may be hidden from view, making the buildings resemble ordinary houses.\nA number of conical roofs have a truncated top with a round hole in it covered by a movable circular slab. Access to the hole is by an outside stairway built into the roof. These trulli were for storage of grain, hay, or straw.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trulli as a tourist attraction ==\nToday, the surviving trulli are popular among English and German tourists and often, are bought and restored for general use. Anyone wishing to restore a trullo, however, needs to conform with many regulations, as trulli are protected under the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) world heritage law.\nSince the beginning of the twenty-first century, a large number of trullo houses have been restored and converted into second homes or self-catering cottages. In 1999, rebuilding a trullo roof would cost about three million lire (about 1,500 euros) and in 2009, the cost rose up to 15,000 euros.In late twentieth century the Monti district in Alberobello was largely a derelict area when a local craftsman, Guido Antionetta, began buying up a few dozen abandoned trulli, installed modern kitchenettes in them and added a few pieces of wooden furniture and cast-iron bed frames with a view to renting them out as mini apartments for the night for less than rooms cost at local hotels. He even painted good-luck symbols on the roof of each trullo.In the Alberobello region, local residents who still live in trulli do so only because they cannot afford to move out or, because they provide bed and board for tourists in their trulli.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDry stone masonry\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEntry for \"The Trulli of Alberobello\" on the UNESCO World Heritage Website\nThe trullo and its history\nHistory and construction techniques of Apulian trulli\nThe trulli or casedde of Alberobello, province of Bari, Italy, through old postcards and photos, II - Photos of the first half of the 20th century\nTrulli & Alberobello English Video\nIl trullo\nApuliabase.com - a database of Trulli",

          "This trullo was built in the 18century and furnished accordingly. It\u2019s fascinating to see how much space there was in this trullo in the downstairs, and then ascend to see the two top rooms. An interesting insight into this trullo for a genteel inhabitant.",
          "The Trullo Sovrano is two-story trullo house that is now a museum. While in Alberobello, I met a woman, now in her 70s, who was born in the house. The first floor bedroom still has family pictures. The cost of the ticket is worth the visit. The house is filled with artifacts and",

          "This museum is a must visit when in Alberobello. It is the only Trullo with a livable 2nd floor. It is a self-guided tour, but the docents that were on duty when we visited were most helpful and informative and answered all our questions. The museum is well worth the admission",

          "We spent 4 nights staying in a Trulli in Alberobello the week before last and the Trulli we stayed in was virtually opposite Trullo Sovrano, so, on the last day, we felt we really should have a look inside! It is the only two storey Trulli and there is a nominal entrance fee,",

          "Alberobello is full of Trulli, but so many of them have been converted to shops or restaurants that it is hard to get a picture of what they are really like. If you visit this attraction you can get inside a traditional Trullo and explore the rooms. This is a unique Trullo in",

        "wiki": "The Oratorio dei Filippini (Oratory of Saint Philip Neri) is a building located in Rome and erected between 1637 and 1650 under the supervision of architect Francesco Borromini. The oratory is adjacent to the Chiesa Nuova Santa Maria in Vallicella, the mother church of the congregation. In front of the two sides was a small closed square, now integrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe congregation of the Filippini already had one of the most well-decorated Baroque churches in Rome, and the order had planned to build an oratory, as well as residential quarters, adjacent to the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella (Chiesa Nuova) located in crowded central Rome. Originally, Ortario dei Filippini was also meant to be a place for the Filippini to practice their own, unique, inventive style of prayer. Borromini won a competition for designing the structure against many including Paolo Maruscelli. He was employed in the task for 13 years, often a testy process. By 1640, the oratory was in use, and by 1643, the library, called the Biblioteca Vallicelliana, was complete. Borromini later became occupied by the construction of many components of the building such as the fa\u00e7ade, two courtyards, the refectory, recreational rooms, the Biblioteca Vallicelliana, and the clock tower. Camillo Artucci became the designer after Borromini left the job in 1650 due to conflicts with the Fillipini Congregation.\n\n\n== Description ==\nExterior\nThough the facade is large compared the structures behind it, it was meant to be second best to the adjacent church in terms of materials and size.The facade provides a summary of Borromini's characteristics of innovations style, both austere and technically rigorous. The main body is divided into five parts by pilasters following a concave curve. In the central part, a dynamic appears between the lower level, whose curve moves outward, and the upper level which curves inward. This panel-clad fa\u00e7ade of the Oratorio dei FIlippini was designed to mimic the human body with open arms for those wanting to worship there. The fa\u00e7ade is decorated with upper and lower pilasters with Corinthian capitals.At the corner of the oratory, on the Piazza dell'Orologio, Borromini raised a turret with a clock (1647-1649).\nInterior\nInside the oratory is articulated by half columns and a complex rhythm of pilasters.\nToday, a room in the Oratorio dei Filippini, known as the Sala Borromini, functions similarly to a town hall as meetings and debates are held there.The Ortario dei Filippini features a library called Biblioteca Vallicelliana which is distinguished by a staircase with a depiction of a Bellonian priest. In the staircase leading up to the library one can admire the full scale plaster models of Alessandro Algardi's reliefs of The Encounter of Attila and Pope Leo (the finished marble is in St. Peter's Basilica) and The Miracle of Saint Agnes (executed by Algardi's assistants Ercole Ferrata and Domenico Guidi; the marble version, destined to become the main altarpiece in Sant'Agnese in Agone was never made).\nThe shape of the music hall inside Oratorio dei Filippini lends itself to acoustics and the distribution of sound. The long, rectangular design allows sound to bounce off of the walls and fill the room effectively. The high, curved ceiling pushes sound down to the audience below. This is important because the Filippini used music as an integral part of their prayer and worship.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAnthony Blunt, Vita e opere di Borromini, Laterza, Rome-Bari, 1983\nPaolo Portoghesi, Francesco Borromini, Elemond-Electa, Milan, 1990\nJoseph Connors, Borromini and the Roman Oratory, Style and Society, MIT Press, New York and Cambridge, MA, 1980\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Located on a hill, this nice town has a historical center complete with winding vias and lanes. Whitewashed homes adorn the this area. Of course, there are the requisite churches and basilica and overview. Very nice place to visit.",
          "Wonderful town with winding streets with no traffic. The town is friendly with shops and restaurants and outstanding view of the little valley around the hill. The is a great spot not over run with crowds.",

          "you enter the place and the whiteness hits you. You just need a few hours here, but it is beautiful. If you have reached Alberobello, and have a few hours spare do visit it.",
          "Locorotondo isn\u2019t a major tourist destination but for us that made it even more beautiful & appealing than some of the better known towns like Ostuni & Alberobello. It\u2019s another of the spectacular \u201cwhite towns\u201d of Puglia, perched high over the valley & as you approach it is so",
          "This small Puglian hilltop town is a stunner. Lovely flower pots and window plantings abound. There are even plaques placed on houses to give honorable mentions to particularly lovely displays. You can easily walk the \u2018circular\u2019 plan historical center in an hour or so. Some",
          "We wondered the streets of this really photogenic town one Monday morning. It was busy but not so as to be worrying. It sits up above the valley with all its Tulli and vinyards and is just a nice place to visit. I would imagine it would get somewhat hectic after noon, but it",

          "This charming small town is a pleasure to walk and just enjoy the atmosphere, no wonder it is a member of the \"Most beautiful villages of Italy\" club. If you are coming by bus, do not forget to buy your ticket before (the only selling point) tobacco shop opposite the tourist",
          "Think of white buildings ,flowers ,winding streets and there you have this charming little town.A most pleasant area to slowly stroll around enjoying the charm of the area.It was not crowded when we went and was away from the husle and bustle of other towns.Take your camera to",

          "The map will show you that Locorotondo is fairly small. There\u2019s a round wall structure around the town. We wandered around. Checked out two churches. There was some great wine ( Le Terreza) that you could buy at the lookout point on Via Nardelli. E10 a bottle: the Upulia",

          "Its one of our favorite cities in the area. They hold a market on fridays if I am not mistaken, which is quite nice and fun to go.",
          "We enjoyed our time here, despite the heavy rain one evening. and saw the lights for a festival. Parking was a challenge unless you knew to go to the square just outside the old town where, with patience, we could always park for free in the evenings.",
          "Beautifuk town where you can discover something around every corner, whether it's a shop, a restaurant or something historical to read about. Loads of events as well. Always something to do. Lovely town to stay or to visit!",

          "Truly impressive old town with whitewashed houses (to protect against the Plague?!). Nice shops and bars and cafes and bistros (though we managed to find the worst I think that seemed to love being rude and fleecing tourists). Lovely lovely town orherwise",

          "Parked the car for \u20ac1:20 for 4 hours just next to the information building at the top of the hill. Collected our free map, signed their visitor book and explored the circular white medieval town. Flowers on stairs, bicycles and ladders decorate this pretty and well maintained",

          "We pulled over to visit Locorotondo as we saw the village from the road! It was one of the highlights of our trip. An incredible place to visit and wonderful restaurants to have a coffee, lunch or dinner. Make the time to spend a few hours walking around this village! The people",
          "A very pretty town with clean winding streets and great views from the terraces on the perimeter of the town",

          "Locorotondo is a beautiful hillside town in southern Italy, which we visited recently. There are lots of beautiful streets, lanes, churches, restaurants, cafe's. The views are also beautiful. Another must do place to visit if you are travelling in that area.",
          "But we visited in September so any of the beautiful planters that may have been in bloom in the summer had disappeared. There were some to serve as reminders of what it must look like on full bloom. The winding lanes are easy not to get lost in despite there being lots of nooks",
          "Beautiful old town, recently restored. Nice view over the surrounding countryside from the via Nardelli. Nice and clean narow streets full of flowers. The train station is 10 minutes far walking from the center of the town.",
          "Lovely whitewashed quaint streets, little cafes and eateries to stop off. Inevitably not great for driving and parking as streets narrow and Italian driving challenging but drop off the car and walk. Having said that we had disable mum with us and most of the area not great for",
          "Very quaint and charming old town. recently restored. Beautiful planters throughout. Fun to wander thru alleyways and have dinner outdoors.",
          "A delightful old town of lime-washed white walls in the centre of the Valle d'Itria and the wine growing area. One of the beauties is that is doesn't have tourist attractions other than itself. There is a free car park to the east in piazza Antonio Mitrano only a short walk up",
          "The centro storico of Locorotondo is just stunning. You seem to need to take a picture every time you turn a corner. People take pride in their apartments, there are lots of flowers. Absolutely stunning",
          "A walk around locorotondo is well worth it ! Lots of whitewashed buildings little alleyways strewn with restaurants - churches - and shops . We visited early evening when it\u2019s not so hot. Restaurants open around 7pm . We found the ones in the centre a better choice than those",
          "We visited Locorotondo on a day trip by train from Bari. We combined it with a visit to Alberobello. We first stopped at Alberbello and then like a number of other people we took the train a little further up the line to Locorotondo. I'm so glad we did. It's a lovely little",
          "Very nice village! Very authentique! All is nice, you can enjoy it by day or night, it is beautifull! Don't miss it!",
          "We were holidaying nearby and visited Locorotondo twice on our stay. It was probably our favourite place. It is just a beautiful little town on the hilltop. As well as the fabulous views, the old town is just lovely to wander round for an hour or two, do a little bit of",
          "Nice and clean with it's white Arabic wall it looks like an ancient town. I will be back for sure with my family.",
          "A little town with only one or two main streets with shops etc, mostly it\u2019s just houses. The views are the best part of the town. We spent less than an hour here.",
          "We have visited all of the villages near where we were staying and Locorotondo\u2019s Storico was lovely. Maybe not as good as Martina Franca and Alberobello, but definitely worth a visit. Especially good for restaurants.",
          "Arriving to Locorotondo is already offering you a view of the village towering high above the rest of the landscape. View from the village is therefore very nice. Little streets in the old centre are very cute and there are plenty of restaurants and nice (art/pottery) shops.",
          "Near Alberobelo, the city of Locorotondo has a very interesting historical center to visit with its white houses, squares and a beautiful belvedere that allows to visualize the whole region.",
          "The old part of Locorotondo is classic Italian. A whitewashed labyrinth of small alleys, wonderful flower boxes and small and tempting eateries. The Centro is small and far less tourist oriented than neighbouring Alberobello but if you are in the area then the extra distance is",
          "Drove here with family for a visit as we were staying in nearby Alberobello. Typical of us we turn up at lunchtime in the midday sun so it\u2019s scorching. Parked nearby then walked up the centre. A steep climb but worth it. Lots of streets off the main climb with bars and",
          "This is a lovely little place with a stone gateway into the old town and the true feel of Puglia. Unspoilt by tourism the locals sit in the shade in the communal gardens after lunch overlooking the vineyards and olive trees. There are some interesting churches and a good",
          "We absolutely loved our stay here. We stayed in he old city for a week whilst I had work in the area. The old city is beautiful and it has a nice mix of tourism and local amenities. The Friday morning market is well worth visiting to get your seasonal fruits and vegetables. Many",
          "Locorotondo is a beautiful small,village of mediaeval buildings surrounded by a modern town. The old buildings are very well cared for and beautifully maintained. There is a profusion of flowers in pots and tiny gardens adding lots of colour. The restaurants are good and prices",
          "Alberobello, Locorotondo and Cisternino are truly the trifecta of charming Apuglian towns. After the crowds and tour groups of Alberobello, Locorotondo was a welcome reprieve. The day was a bit hot and muggy and the narrow alleyways and high walls of the structures allowed for",
          "This is a love letter to Locorotondo as the best spot in the beautiful Val d'Itria in the heart of \"Trulli Land.\" It's less touristy (a lot less touristy) than Alberobello. prettier than Cisternino, and smaller, more intimate and less crowded and bustling than Martina Franca",
          "The most unspoilt and lovely old town in the Valle d'itria. Utterly charming and should not be missed. Wander the pretty street, stop in one of the amazing restaurant, admire the view from the belvedere and make sure you try the gelato. Wonderful.",
          "Locorotondo was one of our favorite stops on our drive through Puglia and Calabria on our way to Sicily and Sardegna. The historic center is a maze of narrow streets and alleys lined with wellkept whitewashed houses, balconies covered in blooms and greenery and friendly",
          "It is a lovely, romantic place. Just walk around the streets and enjoy the feeling and the atmosphere.",
          "1. Locorotondo has a lovely old centre big enough to get lost in but small enough to find your way out again. 2. It is not over-restored and many houses are permanently lived in. 3. Locorotondo is much less touristy than Alberabello. 4. The circular walk on the southern side",
          "Like Ostuni and Martina Franka, Locorotondo is a nice small medieval hilltop town. Not much to see but a good stop for a walk, some nice pictures and a lunch. Pro tip: use the parking garage if you by car.",
          "Lovely town full of white houses. \"A must\" when in Puglia. Great for an evening walk with a chance of getting lost in narrow streets.",
          "We visited Locorotondo on Christmas Day and expected to find ourselves pretty much alone. We were surprised to see the town was bustling with locals and many shops and restaurants open. We wandered the quaint back streets for hours as there was always something new to see",
          "High-end shops. Clean. Gorgeous, dramatic setting. Handy public parking right before the pedestrian walking area. Good variety of nice restaurants. Beautiful views out over the countryside.",
          "Worth a visit just to walk around and enjoy this charming hilltop town and fantastic views across to the other hilltop towns",
          "if you do not have time to visit all the towns in the valley -Cisternino, Martina Franca, alborebelo..- choose this one ! It was for us the best !",
          "Is ok but description as one of the most beautiful cites of Italy is incorrect. Ok for a sort visit, but nothing really special",
          "The old city center of Locorotondo is a whitewashed, charming, circular maze. We had fun just wandering and looking...and getting lost. It is small enough that you never get too far away from wherever you wanted to go.",
          "Looking for a place to relax, browse around cute alleyways, smell the food being prepared in the house of the old town, enjoy the breathtaking views of the Itria Valley? Look no further than Locorotondo. While Alberobello is crowded and rather commercial, Locorotondo offers a",
          "Panoramic views. Not too many touristy rubbish shops, but several decent restaurants. Surprising that some are close at lunchtime.",
          "Small but absolutelly charming old town. Ideal for gettin lost in narrow white streets, drink espresso, eat ice cream",
          "Very nice but small town in Puglia. Although there are no major attractions in the town, the town itself is the main visitation point. Known as one of the most beautiful towns in Italy and doesn't disappoint.",
          "Recommended for a half day visit to the old town and lunch, especially if it's at U'Curdunn. Lots to see and easy to park and get around",

          "From the convenient parking lot, walk up and get lost in the intimate white streets and tiny squares. See what \"urban life\" consists of and why the Italians are so good at it.",
          "We foolishly turned up at lunchtime in August to find most bars and restaurants closed which was a bit confusing. The joys of Italy! Tiny but v pretty centre of tangled white buildings and lovely church. Managed a v nice meal eventually, with local menu",
          "The outskirts of Locorotondo are modern and unattractive. However, get into the centre of town and it is beautiful- the architecture is lovely and the views over the valley are amazing.",
          "We came here for the second time as we stayed in one of the Trulli nearby. We enjoyed it and the food was good but the prices have gone up considerably since our last visit. We paid 4 euros for a pint of beer and there are no places to have breakfast not even a decent cornetto",
          "Lots to do and see both in the town and in the surrounding area. Wonderful restaurants. Friendly locals.",
          "Fairly cute, very small, not much to see or do. Hard to believe this is listed as a \"most beautiful town\" in Italy, though it was cleaner than average. Not worth the 1-2 hours that it takes to get off the highway, find parking, walk in and see it. Our cel phones also could not",
          "One of the very nice hill towns in Valle d'Itria, not as commercialised as Alberobello and mainly Italian tourists, small centro storico perfect for a pre or post dinner stroll.",
          "Like many of the towns around,whitewashed and some interesting features on the buildings.It is interesting that this town is based on a circle if observed from above. The nicest place to sit and have a drink/eat is outside the city walls where's there are a couple of cafes with",
          "We came here as a respite from over-touristed Alberobello, and enjoyed it so much that we returned to Locorotondo twice. Delightful to explore the small streets and gelaterias. If you're staying in Martina Franca, as we did, it's a worthwhile drive. It was easy to find",
          "driving up to this town, it looked magical! Up on the hill, white buildings, with vineyards grown on the side hill, then wandering around just beautiful, with red/pink flowers grown, we spent a pleasant hour walking around - it was Friday which was market day, with a wide",
          "We visited Locorotondo en route to Matera and spent about 1/2 day visiting the Chiesa Madre San Giorgio, and wandering around and getting \"lost\" in the small lanes. We found the place not to be as crowded as Ostuni, and not as quiet (almost desserted) as Cisternino and Ceglie",
          "Beautiful small town offering breathtaking views of central Puglia. Less crowded than its sister white towns and thus even more atmospheric! After peaceful walk around we found a wonderful little cafe with a priceless view (Controra), and spent the rest of our visit there:).",
          "Almost the whole town was closed although it was a Saturday morning because as a shop keeper explained it was raining and people closed down to keep warm",
          "This place will blow your mind away when you see it driving towards it the circular town with white historical buildings is stunning .",
          "Italy is full of charming little towns, this is probably one of the prettiest. Its narrow streets go round and round among white washed buildings adorned with pots full of colorful flowers. Its a must visit for any Puglia itinerary. Infact it can make a delightful base for",

          "White colour is predominant in the old town of Locorotondo, with some colour provided by flowers. Sometimes you feel like in another world. In October we wandered through the streets that were almost empty. The old town is quite small and compact but definitely it deserves a",

          "What a beautiful city with welcoming citizens. It is definitely a hidden jewel of Italy. You must visit, before it gets crowded!",
          "Although only minutes by train from Alberobello, Locorotondo has its own unique architectural style called cummerse. Look for the houses with pointed gable roofs. The streets are gorgeous and we enjoyed our little train ride, lunch and wander around the town.",
          "Just wandering through the beautiful white residential district is what you do here. The residences are immaculate in white, decorated with flowers and figurines. This area is amazingly photogenic and unlike any other area we had seen in Puglia.",
          "I have visited Locorotondo at the end of September. The weather was perfect for walking around. The small streets and the atmosphere is so italian, I love it!",

          "Considered to be the most beautiful town in southern Italy and we agree Does not appear to attract too many tourists so the narrow alleys are more or less deserted and very peaceful A lovely stop to wander for an hour or so followed by a bite to eat Good views from the small",
          "Not much going on. The old town is cute, but the old town was not alive on Tuesday at 18:30. It was nice to see kids at the square across the street, but not much going on.",
          "You cannot miss this small but bright charming historic center! Lots of crooked streets with white walls and flowers, not too many restaurants and touristic shops. Definitively a must see!",
          "Puglia is a poor part of Italy with poor housing stock built around its historic sites and Locorotondo is no exception, but, after you drive through the last century's poor legacy you come to the top of the city and an area of real interest. Signs are good. First tip. Parking",
          "When we first arrived in the town it didnt appear to be at all the pretty town we were expecting. We parked at the bottom on the town area (free parking) and walked more into the centre and then we could see what everyone was describing with the beautiful flowers tumbling from",
          "Locorotondo was our favourite hill top historical town of the 'famous Three' - very clean well maintained and photogenic. Parking was easy and free at entrance to historical area.",
          "The town is pure Puglia, with views over the valle D'Itria and its trulli - almost worth the visit just to see them spread out over the valley. The historic centre is beautifully kept, clean and fresh as if it were built yesterday rather than (in some cases) the 1300's. In the",
          "Loved all the white in Locoorotondo. It is a must visit and we were able to find parking easy. I would advise to go to the tourist info point first as hey give you a path thru the narrow streets to see all of the attractions and it means you don't miss anything. As it can feel",
          "We stayed at Trullli Isago (spectacular place!) which is a 3 minute drive to Locorotondo. It's a lovely town (the historic center) which is wonderful for wandering around and enjoying a coffee or gelato at a caffe. Great place to visit and worth the visit. It's a round town",
          "Locorotondo is the place to be in the area, a peaceful place 9 km away from busy Alberobello with it's beautiful trulli. 15th of August it becomes very vivid during the 5 days summer festival when you can enjoy street music, local food streets bazaar also a spectacular midnight",
          "For some reason this village is much better kept than anywhere else we'se seen in Puglia (except for some parts of Lecce). Locorotondo has a nice, clean, crisp feel to it. The area surrounding it is beautifull and even the houses around are nicer here than elsewhere in the",
          "Lovely little town with amazing vistas! Everything you expect an Italian hill town to provide, overlooking the valley of the Trullies!",
          "It is lovely to walk round in the day or at night lots of bars, restaurants and places to see. In the summer they have music festivals.",
          "We visited this town by ourselves, not with a private tour. If you are driving in the Puglia region and you are close by, make a stop in this place for a short visit. It is beautiful however don't expect too much. Also, eating there is expensive.",
          "The old town is beautiful. It is just a few winding and circling streets but it has a special feeling about it. Pretty white buildings, coloured with blood red geraniums and other flowers coming out of every corner and nook. We tried Quanto Basta pizzeria and everything we had",
          "Quiet and peaceful. Helpful tourist office just at entry to old town, even though we arrived just as they were closing for lunch! Worth going into the churches as you wander the streets, but it doesn't take long as it is small. If you go through the old town you can return to",
          "We stayed in a trulli not far from here. We went into town only once, but it was our favorite small town in the area. Martina Franca was our favorite big town. It was a bit quiet in the off season, but the town was very clean, and the few shops that were open were very tourist",
          "We were advised to visit this town as it's very nice, but it was nothing spacial. Its historical core is pretty small. It is nice, but there are much nicer in surroundings. It has nice garden. I recommend nearby Martina Franca rather than this.",
          "It's an excellent one hour stop, easily combined with Martina Franca, as they are only 15 minutes apart in a car. Just walk around and drink in a wonderfully sleepy non-touristy atmosphere.",
          "Such a beautiful town, full of culture and great night life. Wonderful bars, quite hip as well. My only suggestion of you are renting a car make sure to park before the historical Cebtre as the roads are extremely narrow.",
          "I went to Locorotondo after my visit to Alberobello and I have to say that I wasn't impressed. All the stores were closed, there was nothing to do. I mean the city it's beautiful itself, but it's better when you walk around and you see shops and people. There was only one place",
          "very nice and worth a visit while in Puglia! wonderful at sunset. great churches and little alleys!!",
          "We wanted to go to something different, and we wanted to be in italy, and this is where we were near. A lovely medieval town, good food, nice people. What could be wrong. We loved it, and so did you teen aged boys. Who could have guessed that one?",
          "A pleasant small town to visit if you are in the area. We went on a Friday and there is a busy market just outside the old town that is good for fresh fruit & vegetables as well as local cheese. From the market it is a nice stroll up through the old town past the church to a",
          "A very charming town on a hill with white washed houses. I visited this town this month and it is forever imprinted in mind. I liked that many of the streets are walkways. I love the city is on a hill and on the bottom (southern portion is vineyards)--it is lovely to see this",
          "It is a pretty and a relatively relaxing place. The trulli houses are interesting to see how they were built and to hear why they were built. The age old answer it was a tax fiddle. Worth the visit if you are in the area.",
          "We were staying in neighbouring Alberobello and came here one morning for a look around. Quaint winding streets with pretty flowers on balconies and steps. I would recommend perhaps an hour to look around. We also found an amazing, huge graveyard, have never seen anything quite",

          "Locorotondo is built in circular patterns around the main church - loco means \"place\", rotondo is \"round\". Very very relaxing, charming little pedestrian streets, gorgeous fresh market (wednesdays iirc - TBC), definitely worth strolling around for a couple of hours.",
          "For us seeing Locorotondo prior to Alberobello and just after commencing with Martina Franca was the right way to go in terms of the trulli experience. In this way we slowly engaged the area in terms of offerings from simplest to most complex. it's a good idea to read a bit",
          "This is a mini Ostuni but without the tourists to get in teh way of your photos! Also it is a flat hilltop so no steps and hills to climb. Ideal for seniors with walking canes. Apparently they have an annual competition for the best flowers so colorful geraniums and other",

          "We loved Locorotondo for its small labyrinth streets all white, nice painted house numbers to replicate the street on which the house was located, flowers, Christmas decorations, nice view of the area from above. All in all it's a worth visiting!",
          "Paid a visit to this beautiful town during a driving holiday through Puglia. It is a beautiful town and well worth visiting. Spent a few hours walking through the quiet streets and marvelling at the architecture of the buildings.",

          "Perched over the sea, with its commanding position, this is a tremendous spot to sit and ponder. Many bars and restos circle the castle (on the town side), where it's easy and pleasant to have a snack or refreshment and study the castle and its surroundings. Have a walk along",
          "the castel is nice, expecially the upper side, but this year they close the way to go up, so impossible to go n see the beautiful view",

          "As far as castles go, this one\u2019s interior stonework has been restored nicely. However there are no artifacts inside, it\u2019s totally empty and virtually no history or explanations. Just a short placard outside. The views of the Adriatic are grand.",

          "We entered out of curiosity, while meandering around in the old town. The Castle is next to the city walls door beside the fishing port and you need to be fully mobile to visit it as there are several steps at the entrance as well as between floors. It is worthy a visit, as it",
          "This small Castle is set in a very picturesque square. The homes and small buildings were charming. You walk thru an arch doorway that opens to the sea. Lovely walk along the Harbor. Some benches to sit and view the sea and the small boats are to sit and enjoy.",
          "It's hard to look at pretty little Monopoli and imagine it as a strategic strongpoint. Carlos V certainly thought it was. The reason, of course, being the harbor. Bastions were constructed throughout the area of Italy to support the Crusades and resist Saracen incursions. Seems",
          "I was there yesterday and taking a walk any where around it is just super amazing and original you smell the sea and enjoy wonderful views every where and seeing old beautiful buildings and see the locals around you and they are very friendly..",
          "This is a very cute castle, but the best part of it is its view over that blue water of Monopoli and its characteristic village surroundings. There is a fishermen's port just by its corner, definitely one of the most interesting things to check out in monopoli",
          "For me this is something special, I am from Canada so we don't see this kind of building regularly, but here it's just part of the norm. The entire city, at least the original part, is one big museum from the past where people today live. Plenty of interesting things to see and",

          "We stopped in Monopoli as we headed dwon the coast toward Alberobello. The centro storico was very quaint but the marina was where the history was really evident . As we came through a small arch, there was the Castello Carlo V looming over the marina. It was breathtaking on",
          "The Castello is absolutely wort visiting, if you happen to pass by. Living in the historical center for a week makes it almost certain that you pass it several times. Opening hours can be a bit variable, as can the exactness of the information of the current exhibition inside.",
          "This is just a small Castello, but visiting it is worthwhile...you have a nice vista on the sea and the old harbour of Monopoli. The entrance is free and sometimes there are exhibitions on the rooms. It is also advicable to visit it during different times of the day.....",
          "Visited this castello with the hope if visiting the \"underground chapel\" unfortunately it was close off. Don't know why climbed up to the top which gives you great views over the harbour. There was an exhibition of photographs which was interesting but so much more could be",

Walking on the walls in the evening with the sun setting was spectacular\u2026I love these castellos that dot the italian coasts\u2026the one in Rhodes is a larger version of this",
